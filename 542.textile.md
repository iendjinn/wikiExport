h1. Agenda

{{toc}}

h2. Intro Nick

- Request to update (redmine) tasks - these should have enough information in order to produce these reports and structure these meetings
- Today focus - progress from last week - and requests for action from other members

h2. Extension Handling (Simon)

- current thoughts captured on wiki link: http://dev.webinos.org/redmine/projects/wp3-1/wiki/High-Level_architecture_for_extension_handling
- identification of stakeholders - problems with using the current definitions in glossary
- ACTION: recommended, to introduce new concepts into the glossary to cover these needs

DSR: we need a extension manager for handling updates to steer around patents, see W3C PAG on widget updates.

Nick: question on dependencies - and dependency management - how shall we manage it?

DSR: API for requesting an extension could be as simple as creating a named object as in current practice. Note that there may be a delay before the extensionâ€™s service is ready, and a consequent need for an event or call back to inform app when itâ€™s ready.

Nick: Question: do we want/need to distinguish between interface and implementation - request feature….

Nick: is data scheme fo locally available extensions an implementation detail or does it need to be standardised? - Simon to think about and come back on
Stephan: But, if it need to be standardised why doing it as an extension API, and not as the other APIs?

DSR: On slide 12, not all devices will need to authorize extensions, but users will still want some assurance that the extension is safe/trustworthy. Device side monitoring is the flip side of this coin, along with UI for user to review/disable extensions.

Nick: client side monitoring:

3 other parties
- discovery: habib - ok so far…
- policy - access control - credentials need to be in place to anchor
- widget: no issues - but - how should extensions be avialable - answer is same way they are currrently exposed…ie javascript

DSR: the extensions are exposed to web developers as JavaScript, but there are lower level APIs for extension developers which will need standardization. Some extensions could be purely JavaScript and loaded as part of web page.

h2. User ID (Sven/Andrea)

DSR: learned that the EU ABC4Trust project is evaluating usability of U-Prove and idemix, so we should track their work.

ID Review - comments received from dave and John..

Andrea - question to dave: the browser authentication mechanism that produces credentials - BUT can this support a single sign on with different devices…?
DSR: yes, user authenticates to browser and the browser then authenticates to the other devices, subject to user control (raising usability issue).

DSR: I am looking at the role of contextualized naming of entities, e.g. Jillâ€™s living room TV. Separately, we may want to look at WebFinger (mapping from email like addresses to URIs) as an alternative means to resolve names to service points.

Another need: two reviewers on ID management

Sven: outlined the sip protocol

Question XMPP vs SIP do similar things - has this been evaluated?
Sven: not yet - todo for DOCOMO

Hans question: how does it work if the user does not have an email address
Nick: sip addressing does not require user has an email address

Hans: can the methodology be enhanced to address both devices and users
Sven: â€¦.

Ziran: do we need a sip (id) provider
Sven: this is the function of the registrar. this will tell the registrar,which devices you are registered on.

Important: decision in the consortium if we wish to go for SIP or XMPP (or any other protocol) in webinos within the next 1 or 2 weeks required



h2. Context (Hans/)

Nick: for device characteristics see devices status api - based upon universal web apps device ontology

Nick as well as looking top down - may be worth looking at. Google chrome content scripts…

Radaslaw: need to define scope as soon as possible

DSR: perhaps we should also look at ways to automatically assess apps for problems for running on different screen sizes, e.g. hardcoding dialog sizes, lack of provision for scrollbars, etc.



h2. Policy (Davide/Salvatore)

http://dev.webinos.org/redmine/attachments/431/policy_management__architecture.pdf
Presentation on the current architecture

John currently researching policy synchronisation.

Nick: raised a question - WAC and BONDI make the application the subject. is this right? we need to look at?


h2. Discovery (Ziran)

http://dev.webinos.org/redmine/projects/wp3-1/wiki/Web_Introducer_investigation
Gave overview of the web introducer
ACTION: people to review and give assessment on the suitability

Habib - also doing upnp introduction

h2. Web App (Andre)

Important decision to be made on whether an installation can be made with no user interaction

Draft specification has already been created on wiki page
â€¢http://dev.webinos.org/redmine/projects/wp3-1/wiki/Webinos_Core

Decsions needed on
- Distributed applicaiton decision is very important
- No user interaction scenario


h2. Privileged (Krishna)

http://dev.webinos.org/redmine/projects/wp3-1/wiki/%27Privilege_Apps_and_Services_related_to_Browser_and_Policies%27
Nick: policy (state of art) will cover some of these elements - will finalise asap.
Nick: WARP overrides same origin policy

W3C policies:
- same origin policy
- signed script

Nick: signed script api - has implied (confounded authentication and authorisation) - contrast this explicit privallage definiton.

DSR: cryptographic checksum sufficient to verify no changes have occurred. Signing relates to trust annotations. Checksum for manifest which includes checksums for app components as basis for app identity.
Analytics (None)
Hans - has started to do scope. Problem statement written
http://dev.webinos.org/redmine/projects/wp3-1/wiki/Analytics

DSR: does end-user mean end-user in the above? It looks more like app provider/website.
Lead: ….. TBD

DSR: we should look at different stakeholders - e.g. users needs

Hans: to arrange - call

h2. Event Handling (Stefano/Marco)

wiki: http://dev.webinos.org/redmine/projects/wp3-1/wiki/Event_handling_(subscriptionstoringforwarding)
Stefano presented the current draft architecuture

Nick: session management?
Nick: multiplexing? should we keep in scope….
Stefano - everything - currently goes through the browser plug in…. so potential intercept point
- but lower level implementation issues

Andrea: is authorisation handled - a the session level..?

DSR: many kinds of sessions: browser, application, website, etc. so not one answer.

h2. Browser (Simon)

h2. Overlay Network (Dave)
Reviewed web apps in 8.1 call on Monday, see slides/minutes.

Talked with Marco and Stefano on relationship between eventing work and overlay model. One challenge is the assembly of virtual objects and need for coordinating eventing with such objects. We also discussed the separation between the JS API for web developers from the underlying communication protocols. This means we could hide whether we are using XMPP, SIP, HTTP, websockets, etc.
Looking at risk areas for overlay model. Learned how to create Make file for compiling modules and how to dynamically link extensions as native modules.
Simon confirmed that Chrome extensions can invoke NPAPI plugins, which provides an alternative to doing so from scripts within web pages themselves. This is also true for Firefox extensions.
Thinking about how to pass objects over the web page to chrome extension boundary and from scripts to NPAPI boundary. JSON is one solution. Mozilla JS Types are another.
Currently working on embedding V8 in C*+ and calling out to C for access to the native modules, first as a standalone program, and then as an NPAPI plugin coded in C++.

Coming up:

* adding some sample discovery modules, e.g. mDNS via Avahi.
 * wrapping plugin in JavaScript
 * versioning for JS and native code modules

Issues:
Would like to have a clear definition of a handful of demo scenarios as a way to focus the work.
Contextualized naming as needed to realize the personal zone vision.

3.2 APIs Claes
--------------

This is the status for WP 3.2 API specifications:

Wiki: http://dev.webinos.org/redmine/projects/t3-2/wiki

Progress made last week:

Resources:
Primary and supporting contributors for most of the API categories have been allocated.

For Application execution APIs there is only one contributor, VisionMobile, and it is currently uncertain if VM can take the role as main responsible for this API category. Additional contributors are welcome!

Fraunhofer will add BONDI AppLauncher API and WAC Application Launcher URI schemes to related Application Execution section.

There is also a slight uncertainty on resources and amount on work with Security and Privacy APIs. Oxford and Polito are contributors but lead is unclear. My guess is that there will not be many APIs related to Security and Privacy APIs available for webinos applications so the work here is probably limited. We will get a better view on this when Security and Privacy requirements have been analyzed.

Nick: Question - we could potentially expose some security privacy apis - but as privallaged.

Progress:

Contributions to HW Resource APIs and Application Data APIs. Thanks Telecom Italia, BMW, Fraunhofer and SEMC J

There are not yet any contributions to the other API categories.

To be covered over next few weeks:

Further input on required APIs and analyze of existing â€œcandidateâ€ APIs as well as high level requirements on APIs for which we donâ€™t have any existing â€œcandidateâ€ APIs.

For the next weeks call, March 23, I hope to have a first view on the APIs we can identify based on Webinos requirements and use cases.
