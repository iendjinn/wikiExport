Tools description for Deliverable
=================================

The tools used to create the webinos specifications:
* widlproc
* Redmine with Git

All mentioned tools are open source software and available for Windows, Mac OS and Linux.

Web IDL/widlproc
----------------

The webinos API specifications are written in Web IDL (http://www.w3.org/TR/WebIDL/), an interface definition language, it is the same language that is used by the W3C. These Web IDL files are further annotated with explanatory comments that cover the meaning of each interface module, attribute, method, method argument and method return type.

Having the specifications in Web IDL enables using tools to generated code stubs from the interfaces wich can be used as a basis for implementing the webinos API specifications.

The widlproc command line tool (http://widl.webvm.net/) is used to generated HTML documentation from the Web IDL file. Viewing and referencing these HTML pages is much more comfortable and they can be used as a guide and documentation for both developers that want to implement those APIs or developers that want to use these APIs.

This approach is quite flexible and scriptable: e.g. it is very easy to create scripts that process many Web IDL files and based on that auto-generate the documentation. It also allows for a webinos own look & feel by customizing the CSS and HTML that is generated.

Git and Redmine Infrastructure
------------------------------

The webinos project members use Redmine as collaboration platform. Redmine is a web-based project management tool providing a wiki, bug-tracking, etc. It is the installation that is running behind http://dev.webinos.org.

Git is used to track and manage the Web IDL files for the API specifications. Git is a distributed revision control system (http://git-scm.com). Project members submit their changes to the repository on dev.webinos.org and pull changes other members have contributed, so that everybody has a consistent state of the ongoing specification process.

Every time a change is submitted to the server the widlproc tool (see above) is used to generate new HTML documentation for the API specifications that can then be viewed by everybody at http://dev.webinos.org/specifications/draft/.

Since Redmine provides all these features readily integrated, it makes it easy and comfortable for users and administrators of the system at the same time. Users quickly find all relevant informations at their fingertips since wiki pages, issues management and task management, calendars and the source repository are all linked together and can reference each other. The webinos server administrators on the other hand only need to take care of a single piece of software, which saves quite some time. It is also easy to extend the basic functionality with provided plugins. The Redmine software is actively maintained by its authors and enjoys great distribution.
