Synchronisation
===============

{{toc}}

Introduction
------------

Webinos personal zone comprises of a devices which are connected to the PZH. Platform synchronisation in a webinos is to help in connecting between the devices and get same platform experience on all the personal zone devices. The items typically synced are certificate, revoked list, trusted list and policies files across devices.

Synchronised certificates and policies supports the PZP to connect or reject connection between devices and enforce policies even when not connected to the PZH. The PZH spreads updated information as it happens across devices in the personal zone. The synchronisation is bi-directional allowing the PZH to update PZPâ€™s and also the PZP updating the PZH. If required PZPâ€™s in the personal zone can update other PZP when the PZH is not reachable. In this specification we cover about synchronisation working, items synchronised, triggers, and user configuration. In this specification we do not cover about application and media synchronisation, which are covered in the informative specifications.

Webinos synchronisation differs from the browser synchronization as the webinos synchronisation is primarily to facilitate webinos platform functionality. The application synchronisation can be used to synchronise the application contents and is done using Application Status API.

Working
-------

Platform synchronisation in a webinos platform is required for both the PZH and the PZP working together to provide seamless platform experience on all the devices. The synchronisation by a webinos platform is triggered after devices are successfully connected, reconnected or on user invocation basis. The platform synchronisation is automatic and synchronizes certificates and policies. User invocation is invoked by Application Status API. The items to synchronize are dependent on the user preferences; if user opts out of synchronising user data then it will not synchronise those items.

Since a webinos platform is a cross device and works also on a battery operated devices, synchronisation operates only on the changed parts of the file to synchronize, instead of the complete file. This allows saving the bandwidth and the battery consumption. For example, if one of the policy rules are changed, then only the changed rule should be synchronised and not the whole policy file.

Each item as described in section 3 will be synchronised based on the user trigger or a platform trigger. In synchronisation between the PZH and PZPâ€™s, the PZH acts as a central authority. In case of conflicts in same files by two PZPs, the time stamp should be compared to find the last entity that updated the contents, the last item that updated should be used to resolve conflict. A margin of time stamp to compare should be +/-5 sec of the current time on the device receiving. If timestamp exceeds the limit then the version of the PZH should be used to resolve conflict.

Synchronisation expects a directory structure of items on each platform and is a file based synchronisation. The directory structure that synchronization looks for and where the files are physical stored is specified in the "following section":http://dev.webinos.org/redmine/projects/wp3-3/wiki/PZH_Deployment#Session-Manager .Each item to be synchronised should be in their respective directory or in file, and then only synchronisation will be able to synchronize the items otherwise it should fail. The directory structure should be created by default when the PZH or the PZP are created the first time.

Items to be synchronised across devices will have different file formats. Synchronisation will work by looking in the above described file structure and synchronise different parts of file across devices. Not the whole contents of file are synchronised but only changed contents.

The file format that synchronization supports are:
|File Format| Contents of file|
|JSON| Connection and master certificate; pem data stored in JSON structure, meta-data about PZH or PZP, trusted list and user preferences |
|PEM| certificate revocation list|
|XML| Policy, Manifest files|
|TXT| User data|

Synchronisation works by looking into chunk in the file for the changed content in the webinos directories and files. Only changed content are synchronised across devices. The chunk size is dependent on the file type that is going to be synchronised. For example in an XACML file, the whole policy rule has to be checked for synchronisation update but the same rule cannot be applied on PEM file s as we will have to update the whole file if there are any changes.

Synchronisation messages sent from the PZH to the PZPs are Sync_Hash, Sync_Data and Update_Change. In response messages sent by the PZP to the PZH are Update_Hash, Update_Data and Sync_Change. The _update_ messages are initiated from the PZP end when it has to update the PZH and _Sync_ messages are triggered from the PZH end when it wants to update the PZP. All the synchronisation action happens based on these messages.

The PZH sends to the PZP before beginning the synchronization:
<pre class="javascript">
JSON:
{
 â€œtoâ€: PZP ID,
 â€œfromâ€: PZH ID,
 â€œtypeâ€: â€œpropâ€,
 â€œpayloadâ€: {
 â€œstatusâ€:â€Sync_Hashâ€,
 "timestamp": "", // current time
 â€œmessageâ€: // hash id of the data chunk
 }
}
</pre>

The PZP does hashing at its end and reply back with the hashes of the missing data.
<pre class="javascript">
JSON:
{
 â€œtoâ€: PZH ID,
 â€œfromâ€: PZP ID,
 â€œtypeâ€: â€œpropâ€,
 â€œpayloadâ€: {
 â€œstatusâ€:â€Sync_Changeâ€,
 â€œmessageâ€: // hash id of the changed chunked data
 }
}
</pre>
The PZH then sends the missing hashes to the PZP.
<pre class="javascript">
JSON:
{
 â€œtoâ€: PZP ID,
 â€œfromâ€: PZH ID,
 â€œtypeâ€: â€œpropâ€,
 â€œpayloadâ€: {
 â€œstatusâ€:â€Sync_Dataâ€,
 â€œmessageâ€: // hash data of the changed data
 }
}
</pre>

In case the PZP needs to update the PZH about the changes, messages sent to the PZH to begin the synchronization

<pre class="javascript">
JSON:
{
 â€œtoâ€: PZH ID,
 â€œfromâ€: PZP ID,
 â€œtypeâ€: â€œpropâ€,
 â€œpayloadâ€: {
 â€œstatusâ€:â€Update_Hashâ€,
 "timestamp": "", // current time
 â€œmessageâ€: // hash id of the data chunk
 }
}
</pre>

The PZH responds back with the changed hash file changes.

<pre class="javascript">
JSON:
{
 â€œtoâ€: PZP ID,
 â€œfromâ€: PZH ID,
 â€œtypeâ€: â€œpropâ€,
 â€œpayloadâ€: {
 â€œstatusâ€:â€Update_Changeâ€,
 â€œmessageâ€: // hash id of the data chunk missing
 }
}
</pre>

The PZP sends updated hash to the PZH.
<pre class="javascript">
JSON:
{
 â€œtoâ€: PZH ID,
 â€œfromâ€: PZP ID,
 â€œtypeâ€: â€œpropâ€,
 â€œpayloadâ€: {
 â€œstatusâ€:â€Update_Dataâ€,
 â€œmessageâ€: // hash id of the changed data chunks
 }
}
</pre>

If the file is newly created then synchronisation process copies file across devices and the PZH. In case of changes in the existing file, synchronisation mechanism works by creating two hashes of the contents of file based on the chunk sizes. First hash is a weak "rolling" 32 bit checksum and other 128 bit MD4 checksum. The sending PZs prepare checksum based on the webinos file structure and they are sent across the other end. The checksums are matched on the file locally, if there are any changes found then request for data corresponding to the hash is requested from the request originator. The changes are then requested from the request originator, the updates are then sent by originator to the PZ. Only the changes are obtained and applied on file locally. It requires one round trip to complete algorithm. The algorithm is completely dependent on the chunk size used for generating hashes.[1][2]

Items synchronised
------------------

Items to be synchronised are classified into two types: items that are pushed by the PZH and can involve PZP’s in same zone synchronise with peer PZP directly. There is no update from the PZP to the PZH on these items. The second types of items are bi-directional which are initially synchronised by the PZH and then synchronisation can be triggered from both ends.

### One Way synchronisation

#### Trusted PZH Certificate

Syncing of these certificates is to provide seamless connecting experience on all PZP devices. These PZH certificates are used in establishing connection with "other user’s" PZP’s. They can be used by the PZP when not connected to the PZH and for direct or offline communication with other zone PZP’s. These certificates establish communication outside zone and are governed by policies regarding permissions. These certificates when synchronised should also check policy files for updates.

#### Trusted PZP certificates

This is not needed for connection purpose but to allow PZP verify certificate is from same personal zone trusted peer PZP. During mutual authentication, device connecting certificate and the synced trusted PZP certificate can be compared to verify if the certificate signature is same.

If two PZPâ€™s from other personal zone’s make offline exchange of certificate, the information from this session should not be exchanged as this is one time connection and certificate from this session is not valid for the subsequent connection.

#### Revocation list

User can revoke PZP via the PZH web interface. Once device is revoked, _sync_ messages are sent to trusted PZPs and updated CRL (certificate revocation list) is synchronised. Sending this across trusted PZPâ€™s, prevents the revoked device to connect to any personal zone device. CRL contains the unique id of the certificate which helps in identifying a revoked device.

### Bi-directional Synchronisation

#### Policies

The policy file contains information about user policy rules. Policy rules relates to PZH-PZH connection, connection to peer device, and services that are allowed to be used by other user devices. Policy rule control resource usage to be one time permit, deny or allow. User could update any of these policies anytime on any of their devices. For example, policy rule allowing Alice to use Bobâ€™s PC rule has been updated from allow to deny. This policy rule has to be updated on all devices using _sync_ or _update_ messages, stopping Alice to connect to any of Bobâ€™s device.

#### User preferences

Different user preferences can be synchronised across the devices. These include device connection preference, synchronisation preference, acting as a host or slave in peer to peer connection scenario, apply rules across devices or rules apply only to same device. If user allows rules to be synchronised then updates across about user preference are done across devices in the same personal zone.

The user preferences typically contains following fields:

<pre>
JSON
{
 "ports":{
 "provider" :8000,
 "provider_webServer":9000,
 "pzp_webSocket" :8081,
 "pzp_web_webSocket" :8080,
 "pzp_tlsServer" :8040,
 "pzp_zeroConf" :4321
 },
 "defaultServices": ["context", "events", "get42"],
 "certConfiguration": {
 "country": "UK",
 "state" : "MX",
 "city" : "London",
 "orgname": "Webinos",
 "orgunit": "WP4",
 "cn" : "",
 "email" : "hello@webinos.org"
 },
 â€œsynchroniseâ€: {
 â€œuser dataâ€: â€œyesâ€,
 â€œapplication_manifestâ€:â€yesâ€
 },
 "peer_connection": "yes",
 "slave" : "no",
 "apply_acrossPZ" : "yes",
 "only_device" : "no",
 "service_cache" : "yes"
}
</pre>

#### User details

User information such as email id, name, and other relevant details of user owning the device is synchronised on all devices. This information is passed from the PZH to the PZP and aids in the user discovery. This list could also hold the user contact details and user social profile details. This information flows from the PZH to the PZP during the PZP creation but later updates about changes to user details could come from PZP end. The synchronisation is done via _update_ and _sync_ messages mentioned in previous section. User details file format is described below.

<pre>
JSON
{
 "name": "",
 "email": "",
 "image": "",
 "country": "",
 "serverName:"",
 "authenticationProvider": "",
 "social_contacts": "",
}
</pre>

#### Service Cache

The PZP and the PZH holds a list of cache list of the available services. These services are looked at in during service discovery and could act as a triggering point of connection. For example, the PZH can use this information to trigger connection with other PZH. It is not necessary to hold all items in cache list but the items that user searches most and can reduce the service discovery phase. The PZP when connecting in the personal zone needs to synchronise their local service list with the PZH. The PZH when it receives service discovery message from any PZP, looks into this list and updates. The PZH can hold service discovery cache of services. The cache services can be synchronised across PZP’s depending on the user preference.

The service cache list is part of the trusted list and is presented below:

<pre>
JSON
{
 "pzh/pzp name":{ address:"" ,
 port: "",
 services: [],
}
</pre>

#### Context Objects

Context Manager collects information about API usage and pushes this information on centralized database in cloud based PZP. Context object are small information which user access frequently from the context manager, they are local information on the PZP. This context object is synchronised across all PZP’s to provide local information across PZP’s.

Connectivity and triggering
---------------------------

All the synchronisation should happen only when PZH and PZP are connected over mutually authenticated TLS connection and device is enrolled successfully. Synchronisation should be done, only when device is fully authorised and authenticated at the PZH end.

The trigger for Synchronisation is generated from PZH or PZP. Items to be synchronised will be different depending on triggers. Following platform trigger that should be supported by the webinos platform:

### First time connect

This is a special case and causes resource consumption as it copies all items from the PZH to the PZP. Important items that need to be synchronised are certificate, revocation list, peer PZP certificates, policies, user details and user preference. All these information have to be available on all devices to give user seamless experience across devices. The physical location and the file structure are looked in this "section":http://dev.webinos.org/redmine/projects/wp3-3/wiki/PZH_Deployment#Session-Manager . The PZH detects at its end this is the first time connection and trigger _sync_ messages to the new PZP. No information is passed from the PZP as enrolment process provides all relevant information to the PZH about the PZP.

If PZP is a device with small processing power or has memory constraints, only certificate and revocation list will be synchronised, since they are most important items, strictly required to achieve security.

### Subsequent connections

When PZP connects back to PZH, they can send _update_ messages to the PZH if any items has been updated at its end. The _update_ message format has been described in the above section. If the PZH has been updated by any device since device last connects, the PZH will send sync message to trigger synchronisation message flow as described in figure 1.

### Peer connections

Same personal zone PZPâ€™s can trigger synchronisation by sending an _update_ messages. Typically items to synchronise are certificate, revoke and policies. In case of the PZP connection with other personal zone device it cannot invoke synchronisation.

### Update signal

PZP can send a _update_ message, signalling about change in policies for example: if a particular peer device has joined recently. _Update_ message should trigger PZP to start synchronisation. It should be also possible to start update based on the user invoke, Application State API provides support for invoking synchronization by the user.

Configuration
-------------

Synchronize feature of platforms should be fully configurable by user. As user would like to control the behaviour of what gets synchronised. Each item above can be selected for synchronisation.
