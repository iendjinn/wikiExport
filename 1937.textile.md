T35 Phase 2 Activities
======================

Timeline - [[36 Work Breakdown]]

{{toc}}

1 - Updating and documenting the security framework
---------------------------------------------------

First, we have to update the security framework based on our implementation and developments over the past year. This includes:

### 1.1 - Creating a list of assets, based on 2.8 asset models and the implementation

I am working on this: http://dev.webinos.org/redmine/projects/t3-5/wiki/Risk_Management_-_Assets

I would also like this to be reviewed by POLITO.


h3. 1.2- Producing UML deployment diagrams for each platform and the PZH Farm.

This is work in progress, and I expect that SAMSUNG, BMW and FOKUS will primarily do this work, with my support: http://dev.webinos.org/redmine/projects/t3-5/wiki/Risk_Management_-_Deployment_Diagrams

More on deployment diagrams can be found here: http://www.agilemodeling.com/artifacts/deploymentDiagram.htm as well as in any good UML book.


h3. 1.3- Producing sequence or communication diagrams for interactions between components.

At least the following events need to have sequence or communication diagrams to explain:

-   An application communicating with an API on a local PZP
-   An application communicating with an API on a PZP on another device in the zone
-   An application communicating with an API on a PZP on another device in a different zone
-   Accessing the web interface of the PZH and authenticating the user
-   Creating a PZH
-   Adding a new device to a personal zone
-   Removing a device from a personal zone

I expect POLITO, CATANIA, IMPLEO and other WP3 partners in T3.3 to work on this. Oxford will produce some examples and we will then request help from other partners.

h3. 1.5- Further documentation of the policy framework

This involves creating sets of example and default policies, and documenting the Policy Enforcement Points in the architecture. It also requires documentation of those things which are _not_ under the control of the policy framework.

I expect CATANIA to lead this work.

### 1.6 - Further documentation of the authentication system

This involves writing an explanation for how the authentication system works, how the different authentication systems fit together, and how it interacts with the policy enforcement system. The level of authentication required for each action (by default) should be exlained. It will also require the creation of a few misuse cases to document potential problems.

This will also involve an analysis of the privacy implications of the authentication framework. Within scope is the task of identifying improvements to the framework to solve identity issues.

I expect POLITO and OXFORD to work on this primarily.

### 1.7 - Further documentation of key, data and credential management

This involves documenting each place where data is/can be stored, where keys and credentials are used, and how they are (or are not) protected. This will be closely linked with (1.1). The existing secure storage analysis plus the key storage implementations will be the primary inputs.

I expect OXFORD to work on this with support from SAMSUNG and IMPLEO.

### 1.8 - Architectural risk analysis - updating the list of threats, misuse cases and attack trees.

[[Architectural Risk Analysis Guidelines]]

-   http://dev.webinos.org/redmine/projects/t3-5/wiki/Architectural_Risk_Analysis_Guidelines
-   [[CAIRIS_WA|Automated Weakness Analysis with CAIRIS]]

We will add more risks, threats, vulnerabilities, misuse cases and attack trees, building on earlier work. However, it will be an _architectural_ risk analysis based on the deployment diagrams, security features and components we know exist. This includes (1) looking at known attacks patterns (e.g. OWASP top attacks), (2) identify assumptions made by these components which may break (e.g. what could an attacker do to each component?) and (3) looking at the components and any known flaws in libraries/tools. Where possible, attack trees will be created to better explain any threats.

This process relies upon diagrams existing, and will therefore require (1.1)-<span class="1.7">to have started. It will also use notes I have been taking all year ( http://dev.webinos.org/redmine/projects/t3-5/wiki/Interim_report#Resources-38-Ideas ). A focus of this investigation will be Denial of Service attacks.

This process also requires security expertise, and I therefore expect OXFORD and POLITO to work on it primarily. I would also like FOKUS and TNO to help, if Martin and Victor have time.

h3. 1.9</span>- State of the art survey

We will look at Tizen and B2G / Mozilla for state of the art analysis. We will compare their security architectures, e.g. https://wiki.mozilla.org/Apps/Security

Oxford and W3C will primarily look into this, with the aim of producing a survey paper.

IMPLEO interested in WebIntents + Security analysis. May help introducing us to Tizen.

### 1.10 Investigate websocket issue and WRT <-> PZP communication

IMPLEO to lead.

### 1.11 Per-API Analysis

Each API will be analysed with respect to threats and risks.
Page: [[D036_API_Security_Issues]]

OXFORD to lead

2 - Addressing new issues and requirements
------------------------------------------

According to the DoW we have to handle some more issues in phase two of the security framework. In particular:

### 2.1 - Cloud security.

The reviewers wanted to see a better analysis of cloud security issues. An outline of the expected result can be seen here:

http://dev.webinos.org/redmine/projects/t3-5/wiki/Cloud_Security_and_Privacy#webinos-in-the-cloud

I expect OXFORD and POLITO to work on this.

Suggestion - look at home router scenario for PZH and hardware security.

### 2.2 - Security evaluation.

This will involve coming up with a evaluation framework for webinos platforms. How do we test whether any particular implementation of webinos is secure?

I suggest we do not address this issue due to time constraints. If we do decide to do this later, it can be done after the 3.6 deliverable deadline.

### 2.3 - Security lifecycle: best practices and guidance (technical, organisational, user)

This involves coming up with better guidance for webinos developers, webinos app developers, users of webinos and organisations wishing to support webinos devices.

I suggest we do not address this issue due to time constraints. If we do decide to do this later, it can be done after the 3.6 deliverable deadline.

### 2.4 - DDoS protection

This involves identifying how we can mitigate the risk to web applications and webinos platforms from DDoS. Steps:

-   Identify the most likely DDoS-based threats (part of 1.4)
-   Identify which of our APIs would be most vulnerable to DDoS and therefore require protection
-   Identify architectural components and designs which may increase exposure to DDoS threats - e.g. are nodejs or the XACML engine particularly vulnerable?
-   Identify mitigating techniques, tools or changes in spec which might solve these problems

I expect OXFORD to work on this

### 2.5 - PZH-based security controls

This involves specifying the security and privacy features that must be implemented by the PZH. Many of these are to help users who lose a device or have it stolen/compromised. At present this just consists of revocation, but could also include some of:

-   remote wiping of application data
-   intrusion detection
-   "phone home" functionality
-   personal zone hub migration between farms

This should fit with the OMA DM specifications / standards.

I expect this to be implemented with WP4 by SAMSUNG and BMW supported by OXFORD.

### 2.6 - Browser-safe APIs

This involves analysing our current APIs and identifying those which can be made browser safe, and what changes are necessary.

This will be lead by W3C

### 2.7 - Investigate recommendations for Content Security Policy for webinos

This involves identifying recommendations for how apps should use CSP and CORS in different contexts.

Bearing in mind that Mozilla are specifying a CSP profile for ‘trusted apps’

### 2.8 - Defining application types and differences in the security model

This involves defining any differences in security between browser-based and WRT-based apps, and how webinos will treat them. Ideally, we don’t want there to be any difference.

### 2.9 - Secure UI requirements and specification

This involves defining the measures that webinos will take to authenticate the system to the user, so that any UI notifications are difficult for an app to spoof. Dave has worked on this a little already.

The paper we have referred to previously - http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?doid=1073001.1073009

### 2.10 - Securing data at rest

This involves providing an analysis of what data protection features are necessary / proposed.

This will be related to - http://dev.webinos.org/redmine/projects/wp4/wiki/Secure_Storage_Analysis

### 2.11 - Threat model

This involves specifying our threat model for webinos. This is closely related to the Entity Definitions work and the API analysis - http://dev.webinos.org/redmine/projects/t3-5/wiki/Security_Assumptions_and_Trusted_Components
