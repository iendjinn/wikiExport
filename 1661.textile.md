Cloud Security and Privacy
==========================

Introduction
------------

Cloud computing has emerged as a distributed system of choice for many use cases. As a utility, cloud platforms enable a pay-per-use basis, while their dynamic scalability attributes enable automated increase or decrease of resources for a particular service in response to increasing or falling demand, respectively. However, security and privacy remains one of the biggest challenges ([[D036_References#Kandukuri-cloud-sec-09|Kandukuri-cloud-sec-09]]); as a result many organisations are reluctant in adopting cloud computing, especially when it comes to critical or sensitive applications.

Despite these challenges, significant strides have been made in the adoption of cloud computing as can be seen by an increase in cloud service offerings in the area of storage ([[D036_References#Dropbox|Dropbox]]), communication and social networking. It is therefore impossible for webinos to completely ignore cloud computing; several applications running on webinos-enabled devices will use cloud services, others applications may be hosted on the cloud or indeed some components, such as the Personal Zone Hub (PZH), may be deployed in the cloud. For example, see the possible PZH deployment profile in the D3.3 informative specifications ([[D036_References#Webinos-D33|Webinos-D33]]). However, in order for webinos to successfully take advantage of cloud computing or indeed work with services on the cloud, it is important that security and privacy implications are understood.

This section aims to meet this goal by investigating how the use of cloud computing could affect the security and privacy of webinos. More specifically, the section investigates the possible assets that could exist in a cloud-based PZH and how these are affected by common threats and vulnerabilities associated with cloud computing.

The investigations are based on the following scenario. _Alice_ is a technology enthusiast who always wants to take advantage of new technology to make her life easier. She has been encouraged by cloud computing’s promise of on-demand provision of resources, global accessibility and pay-per-use model. She recently signed up to Amazon Web Services and has now started using these services; she has so far managed to deploy a gaming application and streaming service. _Alice_ has realised that there are some free compute cycles on her account and she has decided to use those for webinos. Depending on how this goes, she may decide to offer this as a service to her friends. However, before she can do that she needs to understand what the impact of this move on the security of her data and her privacy would be.

To help _Alice_ decide on whether or not it would be ok to use cloud computing, the section begins with some background on general cloud computing issues including its definition and some of the top threats to its adoption. Following this, a security and privacy analysis is performed on a cloud-based Personal Zone Hub. This analysis identifies the assets that may exist in a cloud environment and then investigates how these assets are affected by some of the common threats identified in the background. The section then describes how these threats might be realised.

Background
----------

Cloud computing has emerged as one of the hot topics in distributed computing. However, there is still confusion on how cloud computing is defined. Some suggest that it is a new architecture and approach, while others argue that it is simply a modification of the business models rather than a new computation paradigm. In order for the analysis to be useful, this section needs to make clear the view of cloud computing adopted; with the hope that this view will be shared with _Alice_. For this reason, the next section covers the definition and taxonomy of cloud computing before discussing the security challenges of using it.

### Cloud definition, taxonomy and examples

Despite significant attempts at defining cloud computing, there is still no consensus on its definition. However, one commonly accepted definition is that from NIST ([[D036_References#NistCloudDefinition2011|NistCloudDefinition2011]]):

> Cloud computing is a model for enabling ubiquitous, convenient, on-demand network access to a shared pool of configurable computing resources (e.g., networks, servers, storage, applications, and services) that can be rapidly provisioned and released with minimal management effort or service provider interaction.

Central to this definition is the idea of on-demand provision of computational resources ([[D036_References#CloudSecMather2009|CloudSecMather2009]], [[D036_References#CloudCompRittinghouse2010|CloudCompRittinghouse2010]]) so that users can start with a minimal set of resources, which can be dynamically increased or decreased depending on demand. This enables a pay-per use model where users only get to pay for the amount of resources used rather than for the ownership of those resources. To support this, cloud computing is designed with a number of characteristics.

#### Service Models

Cloud computing services can be provided using three main models:

-   â€œSoftware as a serviceâ€ (SaaS) - the customer does not purchase software, but rather rents it for use on a subscription or pay-per-use model
-   â€œPlatform as a serviceâ€ (PaaS) - the vendor offers a development environment to application developers, who develop applications and offer those services through the providerâ€™s platform
-   â€œInfrastructure as a serviceâ€ (IaaS) - the vendor provides the infrastructure to run the applications, but the cloud computing approach makes it possible to offer a pay-per- use model and to scale the service depending on demand.

Other less common used models include:
* â€œCommunication as a serviceâ€ - a subtype of Software-as-a-Service model, where providers are responsible for the management of hardware and software, e.g. VoIP, instant messaging, and
* â€œSecurity as a serviceâ€ - a vendor offers security functionalities like e-mail and web content filtering, vulnerability management, etc.

#### Essential Characteristics

NIST identifies five key characteristics of cloud computing including:

1.  On-demand self-service - users can request more services any time and the system used can provide these services automatically without requiring human interaction.
2.  Broad network access - the services can be globally accessed using standard network mechanisms, enabling users to use different devices such as mobile phones, tablets, laptops, and workstations.
3.  Shared resource - a multi-tenant model enables resources to be shared among a number of users while giving an illusion that each user owns the resource.
4.  Rapid elasticity - the capabilities and/or capacity of resources can be increased or decreased automatically without affecting the availability of the services.
5.  Measurable services - resources used can be transparently monitored and measured for the purpose of billing and monitoring of service-levels

### Cloud security models

Security concerns about cloud computing include a mix of old and new threats, targeting software bugs, exploiting social engineering, and involving network security and access controls. These exist at different levels including: network, host and application. Sensitive data must be adequately secured at each level to avoid confidentiality and integrity breaches. Furthermore, proper access control, accountability identity and access management must be designed in order to achieve efficient procedures, mitigate complexity, improve user experience, and reduce errors and insecure short-cuts.

#### Cloud security - network

Like all network-based systems, cloud systems expose significant risk at network level. Data in transit to and from the cloud infrastructure may suffer from confidentiality and integrity problems resulting from activities by malicious agents along the path. Unauthorized access can also be problematic when cloud providers do not adopt effective IP address reallocation mechanisms ([[D036_References#DHCP|DHCPDynamicIPAddressing]]) that ensure that an IP address that was originally assigned to a resource that is no longer needed cannot be used to access that same resource. As a result of this, customers cannot assume that network access to their resources is terminated upon release of its IP address, opening the path to unwanted access.

Cloud system must also guarantee high availability. For example, BGP hijacking ([[D036_References#BGPAttacks04|BGPAttacks04]]) can affect the availability of cloud-based resources, while the use of external DNS querying exposes clouds to DoS attacks.

The use of cloud systems also introduces new and different security boundaries. The established model of network zones and domains is replaced with less precise and firm â€œsecurity groupsâ€, â€œsecurity domainsâ€ or â€œvirtual data centersâ€. Conceptually, this allows separation between tiers, but these need to be properly understood if security breaches and improper use is to be avoided.

Network security hardening is necessary to avoid common network attacks. For example, confidentiality and integrity can be assured by appropriate encryption and digital signature, network filters (e.g., firewall) should be shaped and managed by cloud providers. For the sake of accountability and forensics, provider-managed aggregation of security event logs is desirable, and to timely address ongoing problems, network-based intrusion detection system/intrusion prevention system is useful.

#### Cloud security - host level

Although there are few new host level security threats and vulnerabilities, some are inherited from related environments, e.g. some virtualization security threats carry into the public cloud computing environment. Even if the threats are not conceptually new, cloud computing harnesses the power of thousands of compute nodes, combined with the homogeneity of the operating system employed by hosts. This means threats can propagate quickly and easily.

Different cloud models imply slightly different security requirements.

In SaaS and PaaS, host security is opaque to customers. The responsibility of securing the hosts is relegated to the CSP (Cloud Service Provider), who institutes the necessary security controls. These include restricting physical and logical access to hypervisor and other forms of employed virtualization layers.

In the IaaS cloud model, the CSP has to secure the virtualization layer. A vulnerable hypervisor could expose all user domains to malicious insiders. The customer guest OS (or virtual server) is also a point of interest. It has an operating system provisioned on top of the virtualization layer that customers have full access to. Since the virtual server may be accessible to anyone on the Internet, access mitigation steps should be taken to restrict access to virtual instances. It is therefore necessary to adopt a _secure-by-default_ configuration; this includes tracking the inventory of VM images and OS versions that are prepared for cloud hosting.

#### Cloud security - application level

In addition to well known application vulnerabilities, and well known attack types, cloud-based systems can experience other attacks. For example, an application-level DoS attack could manifest itself as high-volume web page reloads, XML web services requests, or protocol-specific requests supported by a cloud service. These kinds of attacks can be particularly dangerous because it is difficult to selectively filter the malicious traffic without impacting the service as a whole ([[D036_References#AppLayerDDOSXie|AppLayerDDOSXie]]). This is because attackers use legitimate HTTP requests to the victim, which are indistinguishable from requests coming from genuine users ([[D036_References#AppLayerDDOSXie|AppLayerDDOSXie]], [[D036_References#AppLayerDDOSMonitor09|AppLayerDDOSMonitor09]]). DoS attacks on pay-as-you-go cloud applications could result in an increased cloud utility bill due to increased use of network bandwidth, CPU, and storage consumption. Therefore, sufficient protections need to be put in place to prevent resources used by a hijacked or exploited cloud accounts from being enrolled into botnets.

End users should be conscious about security and take appropriate steps to protect their web browsers from attacks. They must install patches and updates in a timely basis to mitigate threats related to browser vulnerabilities. However, as cloud-based services become widespread, relying on users alone will not be sufficient, so providers need to give some kind of assurance of adequate security. This assurance might be in the form of legal responsibility; for example, SaaS providers are largely responsible for securing the applications and components they offer to customers, while customers are usually responsible for operational security functions, including user and access management as supported by the provider.

In a PaaS context, developers need to become familiar with specific APIs for deploying and managing software modules to enforce security controls as part of their product life cycle. In theory, developers should expect CSPs to offer a set of security features, including user authentication, single sign-on (SSO), authorization, and SSL or TLS support, made available via the API. In the IaaS model , however, matters are predominantly left in the hands of end users. Customers should not expect any application security assistance from CSPs beyond basic guidance on firewall policies that may affect the applicationâ€™s communications with other applications, users, or services within or outside the cloud. customers are responsible for keeping their applications and runtime platform patched to protect the system from malware and hackers scanning for vulnerabilities to gain unauthorized access to their data in the cloud, and highly recommended to design and implement applications with a â€œleast-privilegedâ€ runtime model.

### Cloud security alliance Top Threats

Several organisations and communities have invested significant effort in identifying and characterising cloud computing security issues. An example of such an effort is that by the Cloud Security Alliance (CSA) who have identified top threats to cloud computing ([[D036_References#CSA-TopThreats|CSA-TopThreats]]), discussed below.

#### Abuse and nefarious use of cloud computing

The registration process offered by some devices accept anyone with a valid credit card or even worse offer limited trial periods, which may allow spammers, worm author and criminals in general to conduct unauthorized activities with relative anonymity and impunity. This particularly affects IaaS and PaaS models. This threat can be mitigated by employing stricter registration and validation processes, e.g. monitoring of fresh credit card frauds, monitoring of user network traffic (possibly in aggregate form, to respect privacy issue) and monitoring procedures.

#### Insecure interfaces and APIs

Providers should be very careful in exposing software interfaces to interact with cloud services, and design these interfaces adopting proper encryption, authentication, access controls and monitoring to avoid policy circumvention, like anonymous access and or reusable authentication tokens, monitoring and logging capabilities unable to identify key events, unknown service and API dependencies. This kind of problem is quite generic and involve Cloud models of IaaS, PaaS and SaaS types.

To mitigate such a problem, knowledge of dependency chain associated with the API, as well as mandatory strong authentication in concert with encrypted transmission is needed.

#### Malicious insiders

IaaS, PaaS and SaaS models suffer from the convergence of services and customers under a single management domain, often combined with lack of transparency of providers internal processes. In this way, opportunities for harvesting confidential data or to gain unauthorized control over the cloud service can be achieved with little risk of detection.

This is remediable by a proper organizational (e.g. a strict supply chain management with associated supplier assessment) and legal (specification of resource requirements as part of legal contracts) framework. Clear, transparent and well-established information security management, compliance reporting as well as security breach notification processes also contribute towards mitigation of this issue.

#### Shared technology issues

Shared technology must implement strong isolation properties for a multi-tenant architecture. Access of resources should be mediated by the virtualization hypervisor, which manages guest operating systems and prevents improper resource access or control on the underlying system. However, even hypervisors can be flawed, and cause unwanted influence of the underlying platform by the guest operating system.

To prevent this critical issue, which is especially sensitive in IaaS model, security best practice must be adopted when installing and configuring the system. Monitoring system must adequately identify unauthorised changes and suspect activities. Strong authentication and fine-grained access controls should enforce proper administrative access and operations. Vulnerability scanning and configuration audit should be performed periodically, and a proper threat management process should ensure prompt patching and vulnerability remediation.

#### Data loss or leakage

Since data in the cloud can possibly be physically unbound to local users, cloud-based data management must avoid alteration of records with no backup, as well as loss of encoding keys (which may result in effective data destruction) and unauthorized access to sensitive data. This is a general problem which any of IaaS, PaaS and SaaS model have to prevent.

This kind of problem can be mitigated by some security best practice, like detailed API access control, encryption and integrity protection of data in transit (driven by a careful analysis of data protection scheme both at design and run time), implementation of secure key generation and life cycle management (e.g. storage and destruction procedures). An appropriate legal framework is useful as well (e.g. contractual obligations for providers to wipe persistent media before releases of sensitive data, contractual specification of backup and data retention strategies)

#### Account or service hijacking

Being a network based model, clouds are vulnerable to phishing, fraud and software vulnerability exploitation. Given that credentials and password are often reused, the impact of such attacks is amplified. This is because account owners are often unaware that their accounts have been exploited to form the basis of further malicious actions. All IaaS, PaaS and SaaS can suffer of these issues.

A mandatory policy on credentials (e.g. prohibit sharing of passwords or credentials between users and services), and leveraging multi-factor authentication techniques (whenever possible) as well as proactive monitoring to promptly identify unauthorized entities can alleviate impact of this threat.

#### Unknown risk profile

A detailed knowledge of security posture is important for threat prevention. Understanding the software, software updates, security practices, intrusion attempts, and employed security controls are important factors in understanding current risk level and planning adequate modifications. The temptation of employing _security by obscurity_ should be avoided as opaque designs make in-depth analysis difficult. This is a general concern that is valid for all cloud models.

Mitigating practices include providing information about who is sharing the infrastructure, disclosure of network intrusion logs, redirection attempts (and success), and partial/full disclosure of infrastructure details (e.g. patch level, firewalls, etc). Even if not intuitive, these processes foster a more vulnerability-free and secure system.

webinos in the cloud
--------------------

Although webinos is designed to run on devices such as in-car systems and mobile devices, it relies on inter-device connectivity for several aspects of its operation. In particular, keeping a list of preferences synchronized across a user’s devices or sharing media content requires the devices to connect to each other or to a mediating component. These devices could be geographically distributed across the globe. As a result, webinos relies on global scale infrastructure such as the Internet to provide connectivity. However, such infrastructures are faced with a multitude of security and privacy problems. webinos’ use of these infrastructures imply that it will also be exposed to these problems, and its cross device nature would make it an even more attractive target for attackers. For this reason it is important to understand the impact of webinos’ reliance on these infrastructures on the security and privacy of both webinos devices and the data they handle.

### Why in the cloud?

The webinos architecture proposes to make use of cloud infrastructure to host personal zone hubs (PZHs). The primary requirement of a PZH is that it is constantly available via the internet and is at a known address. High availability is one of the key selling points of a cloud, so this implementation choice makes sense. Alternative scenarios such as a PZH being on a home router are also possible, but unlikely to be as available for users such as our personas Georg and Clara (since these users are quite mobile and may require global access to their PZH).

A cloud-based PZH would need to be provided by a cloud service provider. This would be a service which inevitably cost money, perhaps as part of a mobile contract or with home broadband connection providers. The service could be charged on a per usage basis or as a one-off fee. Cloud hosting would allow for many additional bundled services, such as cloud storage and backup or enhanced security and assurance (see later).

Deploying services on a cloud infrastructure has some widely recognized barriers, which seems acceptable in the webinos case for the following reasons:

1.  **Availability of service**: since the use is limited to a single person, the assurance level provided by cloud providers is acceptable for a personal zone. The synchronisation and data caching features provided by personal zones may be seen as a way of mitigating availability issues. However, in the case of a personal zone hub used by an entire organisation (and ‘enterprise zone hub’), it is likely this assumption should be discarded. In that case, one possible risk mitigation strategy would be to have this enterprise hub hosted on multiple cloud providers. In this case, some functionality to synchronising between the two personal zone hubs (hosted by different cloud providers) would be desirable.
2.  **Data lock-in**: occurs when a cloud provider stores or manages a user’s data in a way that is only compatible with their system, so that it becomes difficult for the user to move away from the provider. To avoid this problem, the user can export the PZH data and to import it in another cloud. This can be achieved by either directing transferring data between providers or exporting it in some format and re-importing at the other providers.

One of the main expected use of cloud systems in webinos is the hosting of PZHs. For this reason, the following sections provide more comprehensive analysis of the threats and attacks related to running a PZH in the cloud.

### Cloud-based personal zone hub and hub provider

A personal zone hub (PZH) is a key component in webinos. It provides a consistent means of communication among devices; through its API and services such as synchronization. In this section, we investigate the security and privacy impact of running a cloud-based PZH — where cloud-based implies that the PZH has been deployed on a cloud infrastructure.

#### Security Analysis

Security analysis is based on previous work described in D2.7 and D2.8. More specifically, the assets, threats and vulnerabilities identified in the two tasks are used as input into the analysis. These are analysed to identify how they are affected by the adoption of a cloud environment.

#### Analysis approach

In order to understand the implications of running a PZH in the cloud, a three-staged analysis approach was taken.

The first stage identified the threats faced by a cloud-based PZH design and the assets that may reside on or be transmitted through a PZH. Using the literature on cloud computing security as it relates to web applications, common vulnerabilities that may exist on a cloud-based PZH were identified, together with the possible attacks that might result from compromising these vulnerabilities. The output of this stage is a list of threats that webinos could be exposed to as a result of running a cloud-based PZH.

Stage 2 involved analysing the current design of the PZH to (i) mine architectural patterns currently in use in the PZH design, and (ii) identify which or to what extend these patterns addressed the threats identified in stage 1.

Stage 3 used the catalogue of architectural patterns to identify the patterns that could be applied to the PZH design. This stage also included an analysis of how these patterns and the ones identified in stage 2 impacted security, privacy, performance and scalability. This analysis produced a matrix specifying the relation of each pattern to its security, privacy, performance and scalability impact on webinos. The matrix was used to identify deployment profiles for PZHs. The figure below illustrates the input and output of each stage as well as the aspects considered in each stage. However, stages 2 and 3 are outside the scope of this document, and will instead be documented on an on-going basis.

![](pzh-analysis-approach.png)

#### Asset Model

D2.7 and D2.8 identified a number of assets and assigned security and privacy values associated with each assets in a particular environment. These assets where defined at higher level of granularity, i.e. system level. This section is focused on understanding the impact of running a PZH in the cloud. The PZH is a component of webinos and therefore, to understand the threats associated with it, we would need to firstly map the assets to a granularity suitable for a component.

The approach adopted for specifying the granularity is _subclassing_, where each asset is broken down into subtypes that are as specific as possible. For instance, an asset such as _SynchronisedAppData_ could be broken down to subtypes such as _Media_, _UserProfile_ and _LocationData_. Subclassing allows the association of assets to components to be as specific as possible, thus enabling better analysis.

There are several assets used, generated or stored on a PZH. For simplicity, we categorise the assets into two categories, namely: credentials and functionality-related.

Credentials exist in many forms including certificates, passwords and cryptographic keys. The diagram below illustrates the assets that fall into this category.

![](pzh-credentials-assets.png)

The PZH is intended to provide certain key functionality (though the functionality can be extended). As a result of the services it offers, the PZH comes into contact with a number of assets. The diagram below shows the key assets associated with the functionality of the PZH.

![](pzh-functionality-assets.png)

#### Security and privacy requirements for the PZH

Before conducing the analysis, however, we need to understand what the requirements are for the PZH towards the assets identified above. Below, we discuss some of the crucial ones.

-   Credentials must be held securely, including
    -   Certificate authority keys
    -   Any passwords or tokens used to access other services and devices - e.g. OAuth tokens
    -   Lists of trusted certificates
-   Personal data stored on the PZH must be protected. While only the minimum has been specified, webinos may store a wide variety of data such as:
    -   Contacts
    -   Photos, videos and media
    -   Location data
    -   The context database
    -   Lists of available applications and services
    -   Personal settings and information, such as date of birth, home address, identities on other social networks
-   The PZH will provide access control through policies and lists of trusted users. These lists are both private and have integrity requirements: they must not be modifiable by another party
-   The PZH to some extent represents user identity.
    -   Unauthorised access to this identity would allow impersonation and potential identity fraud.
    -   Disclosure of this identity may enable a user to be tracked by applications or other devices.

#### Threats to a cloud-based PZH

Significant effort by organisations such as Mitre Corporation ([[D036_References#Mitre|Mitre]]), NIST ([[D036_References#NIST|NIST]]), cloud security alliance ([[D036_References#CSA|CSA]]) and other communities, has been directed towards identifying and classifying common threats that impact computer systems. Some of the most significant threats that exist in a cloud environment were discussed earlier. These threats affect different parts of a system including input, output and in memory. The PZH is not immune to these attacks. Moreover, some of the design choices for the PZH, such as running it in the cloud, could make the risks of these threats greater. For this reason, it is important to understand the threats that affect the PZH, especially in relation to its cloud adoption.

In this section, we analyse the common threats to identify which of these affect the PZH and in which instances they do so.

**Insider credential misuse**

In the asset model discussed above, several credentials were identified. For example, the private key used to sign digital certificates issued to devices connecting to the PZH was identified to both be highly confidential and requiring high integrity. These credentials may be required to be stored in the PZH to enable it to provide its services. The CSA includes malicious insiders as one of the top threats to cloud computing. A PZH deployed in the cloud could suffer from this threat and allow malicious insiders to steal the credentials. Alternative, non-malicious users, eg. administrators, may unwittingly expose these credentials, eg. through backups. These leaked credentials can be used to impersonate the PZH instance (eg. when its private key is compromised) or issue certificates on behalf of the PZH.

**Unauthorised PZH duplication**

One of the main advantages of cloud computing is the ease of service provisioning, enabled by mechanisms such as migration and virtual machine cloning. This feature enables PZHs to be easily instantiated in response to client requests for PZH instances. Additionally, new PZH instances can also be created in response to increased demand for services from a particular PZH. In this case provisioning of a PZH may be achieved by either cloning an existing PZH or using a standard PZH template. In the former, data stored within the PZH may be exposed as a result. Alternatively sensitive PZH configurations may be leaked. In the latter, PZH may end up sharing configurations, which if if insecure and not modified, may result in break-once-run-everywhere kind of attacks.

**Loss of data such as synchronisation data**

A PZH once deployed provides a number of services such as synchronisation and routing. These services handle various data such as media, personal media preferences or contacts. This data does not have high availability requirements, but if stored on the PZH alone, could have significant effects on usability if lost. The issue with cloud computing, as discussed in the data loss threat from CSA, is that it provides a number of interfaces through which data may flow and thus increasing the attack surface.

**Misuse or compromise of interfaces**

Cloud infrastructures are complex in nature. To manage this complexity, cloud infrastructure provide several abstraction layers which hide the underlying complexity by limiting accessibility of the services to specially designed interfaces. These interfaces may, however, be poorly designed or have vulnerabilities which may lead an attacker to either misuse them (eg. sending well crafted exploit code) or access services they are not authorised to access. Deployment of a PZH in the cloud magnifies this problem. This is because the PZH itself, provides a number of interfaces through which its services may be accessed. These interfaces interact with with interfaces provided by the underlying cloud infrastructure. Therefore any weakness or flaws in either the interfaces of the cloud infrastructure or the PZH itself could lead to compromise of the PZH or the assets stored on it.

**PZH integrity compromise resulting from insecure isolation**

A PZH deployed on the cloud would have to share the resources with possibly other PZHs or other applications. While cloud computing relies on virtualization to provide isolation, several attacks have demonstrated that virtualisation may not always provide complete isolation between services hosted on the same physical resource. CSA identifies this as a threat resulting from sharing technology.

In the asset model, several PZH components were identified to be assets as well, due to their relationships with other assets. For example, the session Manager handles authentication and also comes into contact with other assets such as private keys. A compromised session manager could easily expose sensitive data or compromise its integrity. For this reason, the integrity of some of the PZH components is considered to be critical for the well functioning of the PZH. The threat of shared technology could affect the integrity of the PZH components. In other words PZH instances running in the cloud may not be securely isolated from other services sharing the same resources, resulting in the compromise of the PZH integrity.

**Privacy breach as a result of identifiable PZH**

When hosted in the cloud, the PZH will need to be linked to the user for the purpose of billing. For this same purpose, PZH providers may need to monitor activities on a PZH instance, e.g. to enable pay-per-use of particular added-on services. As a result of this, PZH cloud providers may be able to deduce sensitive information about the activities of the PZH owner such as the services they accessed, leading to a privacy breach. Furthermore, as indicated in the account or service hijacking threat, attackers may perform certain activities which would be traced back to the owner of the PZH.

**Sensitive residue migration data**

The use of cloud computing for the deployment of a PZH makes it easy to switch from one provider to another; this is achieved through migration services provided by most cloud offerings. This means that a PZH instance can be migrated from one provider to another or from one platform to another, i.e. as part of load balancing. Migrating a PZH instance may involve moving the entire execution environment, such as virtual machine, from one system to another or copying data that is specific to a particular PZH instance into another environment capable of running a PZH. In both cases residue data, which could potentially include sensitive data such as keys, database backs or PZH configurations, may be left on the original host. This data could be used to mount attacks on the new PZH instance or leak sensitive information.

**Data leakage by VM replication**

Similar to the threat of residue migration data, sensitive data could also be leaked by cloning a PZH instance. Suppose _Alice_ requires high availability for her PZH, then as a solution, a cloud provider could create several instances of the PZH, each with a copy of all of _Alice_’s data, so that in an event that the main instance goes down, eg. for maintenance, any of the cloned instances could be provisioned to serve any incoming requests. The main threat here is that of an increase in the attack surface. So that if any of the cloned instances have some misconfiguration, then an attacker could take advantage of that and exploit the PZH.

**Compliance and Unauthorised Data Disclosure**

One of the challenges faced in cloud computing is that of data location ([[D036_References#Kandukuri-cloud-sec-09|Kandukuri-cloud-sec-09]], [[D036_References#Binning-top-cloud-issues-09|Binning-top-cloud-issues-09]]). Whereas traditional dataware mechanisms provide visibility of the location of data, the use of a cloud environment makes this completely transparent. This means that data could be stored in a data centre anywhere in the world. This means that information may cross the border, raising concerns about forced data disclosure.

In _Alice_’s case, the PZH could be running on a server where the cloud provider might be forced, under laws such as the Patriot Act ([[D036_References#USPatrioticAct-UnderFire-04|USPatrioticAct-UnderFire-04]]), to release the data to government agencies. This has the potential to disclose all the sensitive information such as _Alice_’s activities and behavioural patterns and media content.

### Cloud specific vulnerabilities

The previous section presented some possible threats to a PZH running in the cloud. However, in order for an attacker to realise these into attacks, there has to be some exploitable vulnerabilities in the system. One of the challenges in analysing the security and privacy impact of cloud computing is understanding if at all there are specific vulnerabilities that exist solely because of the use of a cloud environment. Grobauer et al. ([[D036_References#Understanding-cloud-vulns|Understanding-cloud-vulns]]) specifies the characteristics of cloud specific vulnerabilities to include:

-   is intrinsic to or prevalent in a core cloud computing technology,
-   has its root cause in one of NISTâ€™s essential cloud characteristics,
-   is caused when cloud innovations make tried-and-tested security controls difficult or impossible to implement, or
-   is prevalent in established state-of-the-art cloud offerings.

Using this characterisation, they identify some vulnerabilities specific to cloud environment as well as how some common vulnerabilities equally apply to cloud. These vulnerabilities are summarised in the table below, which also indicates relationship to CWE where possible.

| category | Vulnerabilities | Description| CWE Equivalency |
| Intrinsic to technology|
| | Virtual machine escape | a virtual machine is meant to operate without influencing other VMs on the same host, however, incorrect configuration of the hypervisor could lead to a VM escaping from its containment and affect other VMs | |
| | Session riding/hijacking| sessions maintained by web applications could be exploited by attackers| CWE-613|

### Extending the PZH functionality

While the PZH is designed to provide services necessary to support cross device connectivity, it is not hard to imagine instances where such a design may be insufficient (i.e. in terms of features). Furthermore, it is hoped that webinos will inspire some creativity, some of which will be applied to the PZH functionality. For example, _Alice_ may come up with value-added services and offer her PZH to other people, for a fee. These services may be implemented as applications which are strongly tied to a particular PZH instance, PZH farm or PZH session. In order to understand the security and privacy implications of a cloud-based PZH, it is necessary to expand the scope of a PZH to include applications that may be integrated into it. These applications may be vulnerable to certain kinds of attacks, and thus may expose webinos to even more attacks.

_Alice_ could decide to integrate one of the applications that she uses to manage her documents with webinos, so that all the preferences and documents could be synchronized on her devices. This application may need to know about the nature of _Alice_ devices, for example to create versions of documents compatible with each device. To achieve this, the application would need to communicate with the PZH, enrol into the personal zone and discover information about other services in the personal zone.

webinos supports web applications that are downloadable widget packages as well as fully web-based hosted applications. Hosted web applications are often cloud based, relying on cloud storage, databases, or even hosted on a cloud infrastructure. The design and structure of these applications is largely out of scope. However, the project will be considering the security and privacy of the concept applications, as well as how webinos infrastructure can assist cloud-hosted applications to make them more trustworthy.

Hosting such an application could be beneficial for _Alice_, as she could use it on-demand and only pay according to how much she uses. However, the question of the implication on the security and privacy of assets still remains. Firstly, the application could be considered a _virtual PZP_. In this case, the application might have access to all the data in the personal zone, including contacts, personal preferences, location data and API usage data. Most likely, such an application will be designed to store this information in a database. Therefore, even though the PZH could be secure, flaws in such an application or the underlying database system might lead to compromise of asserts in the personal zone.

The application might also incorporate other services from unknown or untrusted providers. These services may have access to the data handled by the application and therefore to the asserts. Storage mechanisms used by the application could also be another source of concern. Furthermore, the authenticity of the application and the trustworthiness of the developers deserve some attention. And finally, the level of permissions given to such _virtual PZPs_ could lead to them accessing data they should otherwise not be expected to access or perform actions that they should not.

### Mitigations and opportunities

This section has identified a number of threats and vulnerabilities that could be used to compromise the assets on a PZH. The question that this raises is, how well placed is webinos to counteract these threats? webinos already employees some mechanisms to counteract these threats. However, more needs to be done in order to adequately cater for each of these issues. Some of the important ones are discussed below:

-   **webinos credential storage** - credentials have been identified as one of the main assets in a PZH, which if compromised could have significant impact on the security and privacy or other aspects of webinos. These credentials could be accessed due to insufficient protection mechanisms on them. For example malicious insiders could access the credentials and use them to impersonate the PZH. For this reason, better protection mechanisms should be put in place to prevent these attacks. A common principle that might help with this problem is isolating the credentials from the data and or services to which they are applied.

-   **Better credential management** - in addition to secure storage, the use of the credentials also needs to be properly controlled. Any key that is used must be tied to a well specified usage policy and must explicitly be specified with an expiry period after which the key should be considered compromised. Any backup procedures used for the keys must also be implemented to avoid leakage of these keys. Furthermore, when a PZH instance is migrated, the previous keys must be carefully destructed and new ones created.

-   **PZH instance life-cycle management** - a PZH will run on VM instances that may be incorrectly configured or have outdated software. In order to avoid the attacks resulting from exploiting the underlying environment in which a PZH runs, it is important the that life-cycle of each VM used to host webinos is properly managed. This involves putting in place effective patch and configuration management processes as well as transparency in the creation process of these VMs.

-   **Potential for cloud-based attestation of devices** - the devices used in a personal zone could also be attested to ensure that they have some minimum configurations that ensure protection of personal zone asserts. The Attestation API, already implemented in webinos, could be used more often to identify devices and their configurations. This could also serve as a basis for identifying the possible behaviour of _virtual PZPs_ before admitting them to the personal zone.

-   **Use of cloud based intrusion detection and traffic analysis** - the issue of inadequate logging and monitoring facilities in the cloud has significant impact on the security and privacy of the PZH. For this reason, it is essential that logging and tracking mechanisms are employed to track events on a cloud host and to detect and find the cause of breaches. Dedicated log servers and intrusion detection systems capable of collecting security relevant events must be used all the time.

-   **Reclaiming cloud-based data** - one advantage that cloud-based web applications may gain from webinos is the ability to store data reliably on the user’s own platform. At present, web applications such as Google Docs store data centrally, to provide access from anywhere, backup, and synchronisation. As webinos will provide these through the PZH and its own infrastructure, private data can be reliably stored using browser local storage. This has advantages for privacy: while this data is still accessible to the application, if the user decided to delete it, the data is no longer available. Furthermore, the user can enforce their own policies for passing data to a third party. This may be an advantage for application providers, as they will be able to avoid data protection requirements by not holding personal data themselves.

-   **Better and verifiable VM provenance** - the VMs used to host the PZH might introduce vulnerabilities due to improper configuration or use of vulnerable components. For this reason, the provenance of the VMs must be securely collected in a manner that enables verification of key properties ([[D036_References#NamilukoVmProvenance2012|NamilukoVMProvenance2012]]). This provenance should include the origin and integrity of the components used, the configurations applied and operations performed to prepare the VM in readiness for use in hosting a PZH.

-   **PZH architecture considerations** - the PZH could be designed using several approaches. For example, the current implementation is such that the PZH operates similar to a monolithic kernel - storing all the data and providing all the services from a single component. Other alternative designs should be careful considered and evaluated to determine how they fair against cloud related threats. This work will be performed as part of stages 2 and 3 in the analysis, as discussed above.

Summary and conclusion
----------------------

The promise of unlimited resources, on-demand service and pay-per-use model of cloud computing is significantly attractive to webinos. However, the use of cloud computing has the potential to expose webinos to significant security and privacy risks. While several attempts have been made to identifying and classifying cloud-related security and privacy issues, these need to be put into context in order to understand how the use of a cloud could affect webinos. This understanding enables users to make informed decisions about the choice of a cloud environment for webinos. To a user thinking about deploying a PZH in the cloud, understanding the kinds of assets such as credentials and synchronisation data that could exist in the cloud and the threats that these could be exposed to is vital in deciding whether or not the risks of running a PZH in the cloud are worth taking. To a provider, or indeed some one thinking about offering PZH services to other users, this understanding is vital in deciding the level of risk that their customers would be exposed to as well as in deciding how much of the responsibility they would be willing to carry. This section provides information necessary to develop such an understanding. By analysing the functionality of a PZH, several critical asserts were identified. These include media content, credentials such as private keys used in authentication, PZH users list and calendar data such as contacts and appointment schedules.

### Key Findings

The key findings of the investigations in this section can be summarised as follows:

-   webinos can take advantage of flexible, on-demand and pay-per-use services enabled by the adoption of a cloud-based system,
-   security and privacy issues must, however, be identified, characterised and addressed before webinos can take full advantage of cloud computing,
-   the analysis demonstrates that significant number of assets may be exposed to common security and cloud-specific threats and therefore require careful consideration of the risks involved,
-   vulnerabilities in the underlying infrastructure or environment used to host a PZH or resulting from inherent characteristics of cloud computing or the technology it employs could be exploited to compromise the security and privacy of the assets on a PZH,
-   a number of mitigations could be employed to reduce or eliminate some of the threats, such as better architecture for the PZH that employs principles such as separation of concern and security in-depth. However, certain kinds of threats such as compliance and jurisdiction may be outside the reach of webinos, instead, webinos would have to hope for a quicker maturity in the cloud offerings.

### Recommendations

This section has presented the threats and vulnerabilities that a cloud-based PZH could be exposed and which _Alice_ would have to aware about. But what does this mean to _Alice_, or anyone thinking about using webinos in the cloud? Based on the analyses performed, the following recommendations are provided:

-   **Minimal PZH services** - the architecture of the PZH must be designed with a minimal set of services following the principle of separation of concern. The impact of the architecture of the PZH on security and privacy will be investigated as part of stages 2 and 3
-   **Secure design principles** - well known security principles such as security in-depth and separation of concern must be employed in the design of the PZH, while other principles such as security by obscurity must be avoided.
-   **Transparency** - cloud offerings must be more transparent to allow the users to see the configurations of their instances, staff hiring procedures and management processes involving their data and credentials.
-   **More research in personal clouds** - webinos bridges the gap between a user’s devices, allowing them to share data and services. The use of the cloud makes this more interesting, inspires creativity and opens up a number of challenges in terms of how this personal space, which was initially restricted to physical devices, can be securely managed. This calls for further research. Perhaps more collaboration with projects such as TClouds could have mutual benefits to webinos and other projects.
-   **To _Alice_ on hosting a cloud-based PZH** - _Alice_ can go ahead and set-up a personal zone with minimal devices and keep her VM up to date. Furthermore, she must take advantage of current security mechanisms such as secure cloud storage and take advantage of the latest advancements in cloud security.

### How will this analysis be useful in the future?

One of the efforts that have already began is putting the attacks within the context of the webinos architecture. For example the Architectural Risk Analysis involved creating attack patterns for various aspects of webinos and linking them to architectural patterns for the purpose of understanding how the architecture deals with these threats. The work presented in this section could be used as a first step towards understanding webinos architecture’s readiness for the cloud.
