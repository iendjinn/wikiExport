Walk through open Tasks
-----------------------

See "Redmine WP3.2 issues":http://dev.webinos.org/redmine/projects/t3-2/issues

"Task 184 on Nick asynchronous versus synchronous APIs":http://dev.webinos.org/redmine/issues/184: No progress, Nick not present at meeting.

"Task 175 on Stefan Andersson/SEMC to review Aims for Security and Privacy APIs":http://dev.webinos.org/redmine/issues/175: No progress.

Task 174 on Claes to investigate status for Application Launcher API in W3C: Done. According to DAP phone meeting 2011-03-30 there is a decision to not have the App Launcher in the charter. URI schemes are considered enough. Andre stated that for web widgets an application launcher API might be needed, for example for launching applications on remote devices.
"New task 188 on Andre on Application Launcher for Widgets":http://dev.webinos.org/redmine/issues/188

"Task 173 on Andre to conduct payment API investigation":http://dev.webinos.org/redmine/issues/173: There are no specific requirements in Webinos on a payment API. The GSMA OneAPI Payment RESTful API is a potential solution for which JS wrappers could easily be created. In addition there are multiple vendors of proprietary payment method APIs are available today so it is not clear whether we need this. Investigation to continue and we need a decision if a payment API should be included in the scope of Webinos.

"Task 172 on Nick and Stefano to Investigate need for a specific Gallery API":http://dev.webinos.org/redmine/issues/172: No progress.

"Task 171 on Claes to check handling of binary data in W3C File APIs":http://dev.webinos.org/redmine/issues/171: Done. Binary data is supported.

"Task 170 on Fraunhofer to investigate route forward for messaging API":http://dev.webinos.org/redmine/issues/170: Alexander at Fraunhofer suggests the WAC 2.0 messaging module as the usage of tel: and sms: (and similar) URIs is too limited. While there aren’t any particular requirements just for messaging, there are use cases/stories that include messaging (listed in Application Data APIs). The WAC 2.0 messaging module might be a good alternative as it provides:

-   Single API for sms, mms and email.
-   Sending, receiving and finding/reading messages (incl. attachments).

The W3C Messaging API is currently too limited as it does not support receiving messages.

"Task 169 on Hans to investigate route forward for Bar Code API":http://dev.webinos.org/redmine/issues/169: Fraunhofer commented that ZXing Java API is not strictly specified and a one-to-one Java API to JavaScript API translation is not possible. Fraunhofer (Alexander?) to elaborate on this.
"New Task 189 on Alexander to investigate rout forward for Bar Code API":http://dev.webinos.org/redmine/issues/189

"Task 168 on Simon to investigate route forward for Vehicle API":http://dev.webinos.org/redmine/issues/168: Simon will provide input next week.

"Task 167 on Stefano Vercelli to elaborate on DeviceInteraction API and investigate Google Chrome APIs to access UI functionality":http://dev.webinos.org/redmine/issues/167: Even thought this seems useful functionality we don’t have any specific requirements on interaction with the user through beeps, vibrations etc. Claes suggested that until we see clear requirements in Webinos we should have low priority on this API and if we support it we should stick to simple interaction such as vibrations and beeps.

"Task 166 on Dirk Thatmann to Provide input on TV and STB control API":http://dev.webinos.org/redmine/issues/166: The main proposal is to create of profile of the OIPF DAE JavaScript API for apps on a TV/STB.

"Task 165 on Stefano V to investigate W3C HTML Media Capture API versus W3C Media Capture API ":http://dev.webinos.org/redmine/issues/165: The Media Capture API provides a little more functionality by the possible to state options for the media capture. e.g. upper limit of images user can take or maximum duration of a single video clip in seconds. Notice that both APIs require the W3C File API (http://www.w3.org/TR/FileAPI/). There are some ambiguities in the specifications, e.g. not clear if the pictures/audios/videos are saved on the filesystem. Stefano to send a mail with questions the the W3C DAP public mailing list (public-device-apis-request@w3.org).

Claes stated that the HTML Media Capture specification is under implementation for Android 3.0. See http://developer.android.com/sdk/android-3.0.html. There are currently no known implementations of the Media Capture API.

"Task 163 on Stefano to provide input on selection of Device Orientation API":http://dev.webinos.org/redmine/issues/163: Stefano’s main concern with the W3C DeviceOrientation event specification is that it is still an editor’s draft. However, there are several implementations in progress as stated on the wiki. (This was not mentioned at the meeting but Claes offers to take an action to contact the editors of the specification to get their view on the stability of the specification. Task 163 updated and assigned to Claes.

"Task 162 on Daniel to investigate tool for auto-generating API stubs from widls":http://dev.webinos.org/redmine/issues/162: Tool exists and it is customized for Webinos. Daniel will send a mail with information on the tool to the Webinos WP3 mailing list.

Access to remote APIs
---------------------

Stefano has proposed an RPC mechanism where the underlying communication mechanism (web sockets, XHR, etc) is hided to the developer. This has a relation with overlay networking. Andre has also ideas on this. Claes has set up a wiki page to be used to state ideas and brainstorming around this issue: "Access to APIs on remote device":http://dev.webinos.org/redmine/projects/t3-2/wiki/Access_to_APIs_on_remote_devices

"New Task 190 on Andre to state proposals for access to APIs on remote devices":http://dev.webinos.org/redmine/issues/190
