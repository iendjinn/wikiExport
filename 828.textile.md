Application Certification, Installation and Trust
-------------------------------------------------

### Introduction

Whether or not an application is run will depend on whether it is trusted. There are two ways in standard web app security technologies in which trust is expressed: through pre-installed certificates on the runtime (much like the use of transport level security on the browser) and through user authorisation at application install or runtime. In this section we consider the process by which trust is established in applications at install time and beyond.

### Background

#### Requirements

This section of the specification aims to satisfy (partially) the following requirements:

* "PS-USR-Oxford-51":http://dev.webinos.org/redmine/projects/wp2-2/wiki/DeliverableVersionAll#PS-USR-Oxford-51 : Users shall be able to view a list of all of their webinos applications and show the authority that certified the application.
 * "ID-DEV-POLITO-017":http://dev.webinos.org/redmine/projects/wp2-2/wiki/DeliverableVersionAll#ID-DEV-POLITO-017 : An application should be able to unambiguously prove its developer’s identity.
 * "PS-DEV-ambiesense-25":http://dev.webinos.org/redmine/projects/wp2-2/wiki/DeliverableVersionAll#PS-DEV-ambiesense-25 : The webinos runtime shall protect policies from tampering or modification by unauthorised applications. The only authorised applications shall be from signed, trusted sources, which may be defined by the manufacturer, network provider, or end user.
 * "PS-DEV-Oxford-77":http://dev.webinos.org/redmine/projects/wp2-2/wiki/DeliverableVersionAll#PS-DEV-Oxford-77 : The webinos policy editing tool shall allow policy specification based on assets including data, data classes, signing authorities and APIs.
 * "LC-DEV-ISMB-006":http://dev.webinos.org/redmine/projects/wp2-2/wiki/DeliverableVersionAll#LC-DEV-ISMB-006 : An application must be associated with a method (e.g. digital signature) for the webinos runtime to perform origin authenticity and integrity checking.
 * "PS-DWP-ISMB-022":http://dev.webinos.org/redmine/projects/wp2-2/wiki/DeliverableVersionAll#PS-DWP-ISMB-022 : Before being installed or updated, origin authenticity and integrity checks shall be performed by the webinos runtime on the application.
 * "PS-USR-Oxford-105":http://dev.webinos.org/redmine/projects/wp2-2/wiki/DeliverableVersionAll#PS-USR-Oxford-105 : The webinos Runtime Environment shall protect the integrity of application instances as they are transferred between devices.

#### Related technology and research

The fundamental background concepts are those of public key cryptography ([[Deliverable_References#Garfinkel1996|Garfinkel1996]]) and OCSP ([[Deliverable_References#OCSP|OCSP]]). Examples of related problems include PGP, browser security models and certificate revocation.

The WAC ([[Deliverable_References#WAC|WAC]]) and BONDI ([[Deliverable_References#BONDI|BONDI]]) specifications propose an approach for verifying the authenticity and integrity of applications using certificates. Webinos will largely follow these specifications, with some exceptions, as outlined in the following sections. Also relevant is the W3C working draft for XML digital signatures for widgets ([[Deliverable_References#WidgetSignatures|WidgetSignatures]]).

#### Threats

The main threat is the general one of malware being installed on a webinos platform and then performing unwanted actions, perhaps stealing user data or taking part in a botnet. There are many ways this could occur, in this section of the deliverable we focus on the following threats:

* A user installs an application & grants it access to the system without understanding what the application is capable of doing
 * Malware masquerades as a legitimate application in order to gain the trust of the user, who then installs it.
 * A legitimate application is installed, but then loads external data which has been modified in a way that violates user security requirements or modifies the application to behave in an untrustworthy manner.

This section of the deliverable concentrates on install-time trust decisions as well as restricting the application from loading untrustworthy external code. Threats involving the corruption of code while on the device, or modification of the runtime itself are not considered.

### Components

Application integrity and authenticity is enforced by the webinos runtime, in particular the personal zone proxy and policy enforcement components. These connect to the following other pieces of functionality:

* The application installer
 * The application launcher
 * Secure storage for certificates
 * Application packaging, manifests and resources
 * Certificate update & revocation on the PZH and PZP

### Processes

#### Installation of applications

The installation (or first use) of an application is the time when a trust decision must be made. If the application is not trusted at all, it should not be installed. If there is doubt about the provenance of the application - whether it is from the right source and has the right name - it should also not be installed. The following steps are taken from WAC ([[Deliverable_References#WAC|WAC]]) and modified for the webinos install process:

Local applications will be "installed" in the following way:

1.  A new application is downloaded
2.  The application contains at least one digital signature file containing signatures of all files in the downloaded application which are not themselves signature files ([[Deliverable_References#WidgetSignatures|WidgetSignatures]]). The application will also contain a manifest.
3.  Signatures are verified against the signing key and content of the application, as per ([[Deliverable_References#WidgetSignatures|WidgetSignatures]]).
4.  Webinos will check to see which of the signing authorities that were used to sign the application have certificates with roots in those installed in the platform.
5.  The user will be informed if none of the signing authorities are trusted by the platform and advised not to use the application.
6.  Standard widget security and privacy control checks and authorisation.

Local applications may refer to remote content, such as through importing javascript in _<script src="http://example.com/myjs.js" />_ statements. This is a potential attack vector unless the content is accessed securely, or the content is signed. In webinos, one of these two options must be followed. Either the script "src" must point to a https location, trusted by the webinos runtime, or the script must has a signature file linked in the html, e.g.: "<script src="http://example.com/myjs.js" sigfile="http://example.com/sig.xml />".

Hosted applications will be "installed" in the following way:

1.  Webinos browser visits URL of the application
2.  The application must be hosted on an HTTPS page
3.  The application will have a digital signature index document giving a list of locations for digital signatures.
4.  Signatures are verified against the signing key and content of the application, as per ([[Deliverable_References#WidgetSignatures|WidgetSignatures]]). Signatures may refer to any parts of the application - and developers are encouraged to give signatures for all static content. The manifest must be signed.
5.  Webinos will check to see which of the signing authorities (for whom certificates will be provided in the application) have certificates with roots in those installed in the platform
6.  The user will be informed if none of the signing authorities are trusted by the platform and advised not to use the application.
7.  Standard widget security and privacy control checks and authorisation.

All applications must have signed manifests, but they may be signed by keys with self-signed certificates. User policies will dictate whether this is supported by the runtime. The PZH and PZP must store the association between the application and its certificate, and a different self-signed certificate cannot be used for subsequent versions of the application.

#### Update of applications and certificates

Local widgets can be updated by following proposals described in Deliverable 3.1 ([[Deliverable_References#Webinos-D31|Webinos-D31]]) and the W3C Widget Update Working Draft ([[Deliverable_References#WidgetUpdates|WidgetUpdates]]).

Remotely hosted widgets require no special mechanism to be updated. However, the signature files must also be updated to correspond to the new version. The webinos runtime will check each signed remote file every time it is downloaded, to make sure it has not been modified. If it has been modified, the signature and manifest will be re-downloaded and updated.

#### Revocation and management of certificates

The webinos application security framework relies upon valid certificates being used and the webinos runtime containing a set of trusted certificates, much like a web browser. Webinos must periodically (as well as when the certificate is first installed) check each certificate is valid, and use OCSP to check that it has not been revoked. This task should be performed to the personal zone hub, which can make the necessary updates and synchronise them between all user devices.

### Future directions

The processes outlined in this section are largely built on WAC. Further improvements and novel research will be investigated in phase 2, including the following topics.

#### Social network reputation and review system

Application certificates are one source for information on trustworthiness, but social networks may provide more useful information. If 90% of the user’s friends rate an application highly, this information may help the user decide whether to trust the application or not. Recommendations from particular users might trigger policy settings which allow the application to be installed with minimal authorisation.

#### Attestation of hosted applications

Hosted applications may be running on insecure remote platforms. This could be assessed through use of attestation on the host ([[Deliverable_References#Lyle2010|Lyle2010]]). If the host is found to be running in an untrustworthy configuration then the application may not be installed, or if the host changes configuration it could result in a new assessment.

#### Remote code execution

Applications will be able to send code to other personal zone devices to be executed, for performance or power consumption reasons. The security process required for managing this is not included in this deliverable and will need to be analysed during implementation and future design work.

#### Public key usability

The public key certificate system proposed has all of the problems associated with certificates: they are difficult to use and do not scale well to large systems. More time should be spent investigating alternatives.
