Discovery Implementation Architecture
=====================================

Discovery faces challenges of multiplicity of networking technology. Different internetworking technologies are likely to adopt a variety of discovery protocols among themselves. As a result, service information & presentations from different discovery processes vary depending on the discovery mechanisms used. For the third party developers, they would like to have APIs on the internetworking technologies they are interested whilst web developers donâ€™t want to know the details of the bearers and prefer to have generic structures for different services. This has brought the requests for two levels of APIs:

-   low level APIs based on specific interconnecting technologies for third party developers
-   high level generic APIs using Javascript libraries for web developers.

Figure 1 & Figure 2 present the implementations architectures for both levels of APIs. For low level third party API, when native discovery APIs are not presented in Javascript, a wrapper is required. Whilst for high level APIs, a wrapper is essential in order to isolate the complexity of different internetworking technologies.

This two-level API infrastructure solution will bring benefits such as

-   Giving the freedom for third party developer to working on the specific networking technologies interested.
-   Reducing effort on developing applications for web developers
-   Isolating web developers from changes in networking technologies, addressing schemes and topologies

In this section, we will look at the implementation issues from the following aspects:
* Native code & APIs
* Exposing JavaScript APIs to third party developers
* Exposing JavaScript APIs to web developers

We take a simple use case, e.g. George wants to view his mobile hosted MP4s on his own or a friend’s set top box, to start our story on implementation.

Aspect 1: Native code & APIs
----------------------------

### local discovery: Set Box can be reached via local connection. George to discover set box via local discovery â€“ Internet access is not essential.

Georgeâ€™s mobile scans for the set box with any of the following local discovery implementations:

-   Avahi - Zeroconf implementation

Avahi is a zeroconf implementation. It provides a good range of for multicast DNS/DNS-SD service discovery. It is under the GNU Lesser General Public License (LGPL). With the advantage being open source over Appleâ€™s Bojour implementation, Avahi had already become the de-facto standard implementation of mDNS/DNS-SD on free operating systems such as Linux.

Avahi provides a set of language bindings, e.g . python, C, C+*. It ships with most Linux and **BSD distributions. Avahi source codes are available to download free online.

Following figure illustrated some main APIs used in avahi.

![](http://dev.webinos.org/redmine/attachments/586/Avahi_api.png)

Example code is available in our early demo - [http://www.w3.org/2011/04/discovery.html].

** BlueZ - Bluetooth

BlueZ is a widespread Bluetooth stack implementations initially developed by Qualcomm. It is included with the official Linux kernel distributions. As of 2006, the BlueZ stack supports all core Bluetooth protocols and layers. BlueZ provides a set of language bindings such as python, C, Java, C*+ etc.

The Host Controller Interface (HCI) socket in BlueZ provides a direct connection to the microcontroller on the local Bluetooth adapter. For tasks requiring precise control over the Bluetooth controller, such as asynchronous device discovery, HCI socket type shall be used. For a simple discovery procedure, the following APIs shall be available:
> **** Gets the device ID for a specified local HCI device. e.g. hci_get_route()
> **** opens HCI socket assocaited with the device. e.g. hci_open_dev()
> **** Performs an HCI inquiry to discover Bluetooth devices. e.g. hci_inquiry().

An example code is available in our early demo - [http://www.w3.org/2011/04/discovery.html].

-   UPnP implementations.

There are a few UPnP open source implementations existing for Linux system, e.g. gupnp-tools and upnp-inspector. These implementations may come with a lot dependencies, e.g. gupnp implementation depends heavily on glib. As SSDP in UPnP is not so complicated itself, an alternative way is to write our own SSDP codes, e.g. SSDP discovery source is available in our early demo http://www.w3.org/2011/04/discovery.html. It uses scan_ssdp to launch a thread to discover UPnP devices by sending SSDP M-SEARCH message over multicast UDP to 239.255.255.250:1900. It then listens for unicast responses and multicast notifications. When a new Location is seen, a further thread is launched to retrieve the XML document describing the device’s services. This is then passed back to the web page script via the browser’s pluginthreadasynccall which calls the plugin on the UI thread, triggering a call back to the web page.

-   OpenSLP â€“ SLP

The OpenSLP project is an effort to develop an open-source implementation of the IETF Service Location Protocol suitable for commercial and non-commercial application. It is under the Caldera Systems open source license - a license that is legally compatible with the popular BSD open source license[ http://www.openslp.org/]. OpenSLP is hosted by SourceForge.net and source code and binaries are free for download.

Main APIs correspond to service discovery are:

> * Registration - SLPReg (…, service_type, service_attribute, callback…);

> * Service find - SLPFindSrvs (…, service_type, filter, callback…);

An example code is also available in our early demo - [http://www.w3.org/2011/04/discovery.html].

-   Local discovery with serverless XMPP - IP address is essential

XMPP Serverless Messaging (XEP-0174) uses ZeroConf as underlying discovery mechanism. It provides information for two devices to establish socket connection, and once socket connection is established it uses XMPP streams and iq message to exchange messages between devices. Devices can extend stream message exchange by performing feature exchange and authenticate with each other before receiving messages.

XMPP to use ZeroConf defines service type "_presence._tcp" and requires specify port and IP address. All these information maps to A record, SRV and PTR field of DNS field. Any extra information can be filled in the TXT field of DNS which is in form of name=value, where first field needs to be "txtvers=1".

Publishing a service requires device to have server thread running in accept mode to accept connection from other devices using the port number advertised. A thread will handle new connections with each client. Message exchange will be of form iq.

To use the service, device can resolve services advertised in form of "_presence._tcp". Once the devices hosting this services are found, based on user preference, selection or previous decision connection is established between devices. The mDNS resolve contains enough information to establish socket communication with the device and start XMPP session.

</div>

In comparison to other service types available on ZeroConf, XMPP serverless provides service type, IP address and port that helps in establishing socket communication between two devices and then they can exchange messages based on XMPP format. It does not arise the need for driver.

Challenges are how devices in local area running under NAT are handled and avoiding use of local loopback addresses in the publish message.

h3. Remote discovery: The set box is remotely located from George’s Mobile or local discovery is not available. George to discover the set box via Internet access.

In this description details about selfbot mechanism, service discovery (refer as disco in XMPP), and adhoc mechanism is described. The details described here are low level and protocol level and does not describe how webinos system will interact with web developer. The information is underhood work done by webinos platform.

If the set box belongs to George himself, he can use selfbot mechanism to login to XMPP server and exchange credentials. Once device exchange streams, features exchange, authentication stream messages with XMPP server, device will be authenticated with XMPP server. Depending on user configuration, presence information will be hold with XMPP server (Personal Hub).

A typical XMPP node can hold three piece of information:
* Resource/Identity: This typically defines a particular node.
* Services: Commands or function resource can use.
* Items: These are sub node under resource.

To perform service discovery of user own devices, XMPP Service Discovery (XEP-030) will be used. It defines protocol communication mechanism to retrieve information about nodes and items associated with particular jid. Query supports items and info. Message exchange uses type get and result between requesting and sending entity respectively.

A node contain three information: identities, features and items. As part of discovery identities and items are to be discoverable and once they are selected features information could be obtained using URI mechanism or using adhoc command functionality of XMPP, where a particular node can advertise about the services provided.

In the personal zone, all device will not be IP capable. To handle this scenario a device can include all the local devices connected to it (e.g. bluetooth, usb) as items. Any device searching for George devices will first get all the resources and then each resource can then be queried to get all items information. To XMPP server this information are just nodes and sub-nodes.

The bridging mechanism between local devices and remote devices will be a unique functionality provided by webinos system. As each node cannot be directly communicable they will be first communicated to personal zone proxy(PZP) and then PZP will act as a mediator between devices. The communication mechanism is dependent on how services are defined. This could be either based on adhoc commands or based on config.xml defining services.

Next step is finding information about devices whether they are online. User can add different user he knows in a roster (XMPP terminology for friend list) and can define different groups. Depending on presence preference, roster information will be updated once friend and his devices are online. All the information displayed will be based on policy management rules.

User George should be able to get all the resources that belong to him indicated as devices in his personal zone. All devices of the user will be listed as resources. It should be guaranteed that each resource is unique. Once the user select device he wants to connect depending on the preference connection will be established.

Aspect 2: Expose JavaScript APIs to third party developers
----------------------------------------------------------

Because most local discovery libraries discussed above do not provide language bindings with JavaScript, a wrapper to map between the native code and Javascript is required. One solution is to use a cross browser plugin. Following figure shows an example on exposing avahi_service_browser_new() api to a Javascript object using NPAPI. Refer section on plugin for more details on Browser plug-in/extension handling.

![](http://dev.webinos.org/redmine/attachments/587/Avahi_NPAPI.png)

In the case of using XMPP for local discovery, instead of scan, connect function is called with user details such as nickname, lastname, email or any other detail that would like to broadcast.

Aspect 3: Expose JavaScript APIs to web developers
--------------------------------------------------

The high level discovery implementation is to expose discovery interfaces, device and service features for different internetworking technologies to web developers and end users, ideally in JavaScript. This means to publish, find and bind services via web page scripts. The scripts listen for requests from other browsers and then respond in some manner. This might involve extensions on the current browsers with a server of some kind. Extensions on browser out the scope of discovery and will not be discussed here. High level discovery APIs that are going to be exposed to web developers, however, should be defined and illustrated.

WebinOs has defined a set of high level service discovery APIs to find and bind services that are exposed locally or remotely. Local services include services exposed via local connectivities such as BT, WiFI or USB whilst remote services cover services exposed within personal zone and cross personal zones for different users. Basically, the WebinOs ServiceDiscovery module enables web developers to find service based on a certain search criteria. The found services are listed in a selection list in an asynchronous manner. Once the user selected a service, the implementation of the service is initiated by binding to the service. For further details on these APIs and example codes, please refer WP3.2 Discovery APIs.
