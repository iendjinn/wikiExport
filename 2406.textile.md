Recommendations
===============

This section gives advice and recommendations to stakeholders responsible for certain aspects of the webinos environment in order to minimize security and privacy concerns. These are in addition to general best practice guidelines on security and privacy. A list of webinos stakeholders can be found in the ([[D036_References#Glossary|Glossary]]) accompanying the main D3.3 specification.

For Identity Providers
----------------------

Identity providers are highly trusted with the webinos architecture as their ability to authenticate users is relied upon to protect the personal zone. Compromise of an OpenID identity used to manage a personal zone would result in a potential loss of data, personal privacy and could be used to perform a number of other attacks.

We therefore recommend that identity providers do the following:

1.  Implement OpenID PAPE extensions. This allows webinos to dictate when a user should re-authenticate, rather than relying on the OpenID provider to correctly implement authentication caching.
2.  Provide and encourage two-factor authentication. The threat of identity theft and compromise of OpenID credentials is significant and hard for webinos to mitigate. A solution, however, might involve integrating the webinos PKI infrastructure with OpenID in order to provide a second factor of user identity.
3.  Provide recovery mechanisms based on secure out-of-band communication methods. This will help avoid attacks based on a malicious user recovering the credentials of another person, an attack we cannot mitigate in webinos.
4.  Follow best-practice guides ([[D036_References#OpenIDBest|OpenIDBest]]) to avoid insecure implementations of OpenID protocols.

For PZH Providers
-----------------

Personal zone hub providers are trusted in the webinos architecture with the ability to control a userâ€™s personal zone. In the T3.3 informative sections on PZH deployment we describe several potential architectures which can mitigate some of the trust placed in webinos personal zone hubs.

For a provider attempting to offer services and preserve user privacy and security, we suggest the following:

1.  Store all user data on encrypted disks. Do not allow any third parties to access this data directly.
2.  Monitor incoming connection traffic to detect potential attacks on web interfaces and PZH TLS servers.
3.  Only support OpenID providers who follow the recommendations specified above
4.  Support trusted hardware modules in order to secure keys and credentials

For Device Manufacturers
------------------------

1.  Provide user-to-device authentication methods which will mitigate threats from devices places in shared environments. For example, providing PINs or locks that are easy to use yet provide some real resistance from casual attackers. This is important in webinos as access to the device is sufficient, in some cases, to access part of the entire personal zone.
2.  Provide disk encryption by default. Webinos makes no attempt to encrypt application data, recognising that this is something that can be provided more effectively by devices. Enable the disk encryption facilities of the device before shipping it with webinos.
3.  Use an operating system that provides process isolation. The webinos platform assumes that processes are isolated from each other and is more secure if each application has its own area of protected storage. This can be found in operating systems such as Android and iOS, and can be configured in Linux using Linux Security Modules such as SELinux and AppArmor. Native malware is a threat that webinos cannot protect against, and therefore operating systems must provide isolation between processes and data used by each process.
4.  Provide data backup solutions.

For Application Developers
--------------------------

There are numerous guidelines and recommendations for the secure and privacy-preserving development of web applications. Secure software development is a topic covered by hundreds of books and articles which we do not repeat here. However, we suggest that developers are aware of the following existing literature:

-   The OWASP development guide ([[D036_References#OWASP-Guide|OWASP-Guide]])
-   W3C "Web Application Privacy Best Practices" - ([[D036_References#W3CAppPriv|W3CAppPriv]])

We also encourage application developers to request as few webinos feature permissions as possible, and to register their applications with well-known app stores.

Finally, for hosted applications we recommend the WebSand project ([[D036_References#WebSand|WebSand]]) as a source of useful security guidance.

For Users
---------

Users of webinos should be aware that webinos is only as secure as the various components and entities it relies upon. As such, users should be careful in choosing:

1.  The devices they use webinos with. If webinos is to be used securely, devices should provide disk encryption. Devices should also either be used only by the zone owner, or offer user accounts which separate users from each other. For shared devices, such as TVs, users should be careful to avoid granting them too many permissions
2.  The OpenID provider they use. We recommend the use of an OpenID provider who offers two-factor authentication
3.  The PZH Host they choose. PZHs are highly trusted within the architecture, and users should not choose a provider they do not believe to be reliable
4.  The applications they grant privileges to. Applications are a major source of threats, and we recommend that applications are not granted privileges without reason.

However, most of these responsibilities should not be shouldered by the user as (in many cases) they are not in a good position to make informed decisions. As such, these recommendations should primarily be followed by device manufacturers, service providers and app stores.
