Actuator API scenarios and use cases
====================================

Author: AndrÃ© Paul

Changes: New scenario outlining the need for an API that complements the generic sensor API by allowing to use generic actuators that do not necessarily need a whole new API.

Overview
--------

Peter is a fan of smart home technologies and wants to monitor and trigger actions at home using a common device instead of using specific devices for each and every smart home feature. Thus, he likes to his smart phone for doing this.

Description
-----------

Peter bought a number of smart home devices and installed them at home to make his day to day life more comfortable. Device comprise, but are not limited to, things like turn on/off electrical sockets and lights, set light intensity, open/close and lower/raise blinds, open/close and lock/unlock doors, setting temperature, move monitoring cameras or control the sprinkler system in the garden. Peter don’t want to use different remote controls and apps for each of the devices so he decided to install a webinos application that lists and allows to access available sensors and actuators. The application also allows to create some timetables so that certain actions are executed at specific times without manual interaction.

Issues
------

-   discovery and integration of actuator devices
-   common access of actuator devices that do not necessarily need to have an own specific API
-   using actuator and sensor devices in a common way without specific application adaptations for proprietary devices

Benefits
--------

-   allow the user to access all his smart home features using a single application rather than multiple device specific ones or relying on proprietary all-in-one solutions
-   develop smart home applications in a common way
-   demonstrate need for standardized access to actuator and sensor devices
