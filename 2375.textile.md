Messaging API
-------------

### Overview of API

http://dev.webinos.org/specifications/new/messaging.html

Provides the capability to read, receive and send sms, mms, email and instant messages.

### Threats

#### API-Specific threats and misuse cases

1.  an application (or remote user) can read user sms/mms/emails/im; they may contain sensitive data (for example important information about their personal life or work activities).
2.  an application (or remote user) can send sms/mms/emails; this may be used, for example, to subscribe the user to a paid service.
3.  an application can modify/replace the message or the recipient list before sending it, causing embarassment or other problems to the user.

#### Threats based on remote invocation of this API from another device

1.  Remote invocation of this API could have unexpected consequences as it might break the natural accountability that messaging would be expected to have. For example, an application might remotely invoke SMS functionality on a smartphone and the user, who is on their PC at the time, would only find out when they check their mobile device.
2.  Remote invocation could be used to impersonate the user for second-factor out-of-band authentication. For example, letting the application read an SMS created by a payment provider, or reading an email password reset message.

#### Implementation threats and possible attacks

#### Threats to apps and developers using this API (E.g. Jimmy and Jessica)

#### Threats to device manufacturers, operators, other stakeholders

1.  sending many sms/mms may consume user credit; this may cause disappointment with the operator or platform/application developer.

### Mitigations

1.  access to send functionalities by default should be prompted every time (and denied to untrusted apps);
2.  should the prompt allow the user to check the message to be sure itâ€™s not modified by the application?

### Recommended default policy rules for applications

The following features are defined for this api:

http://webinos.org/api/messaging (access to all functionalities)
http://webinos.org/api/messaging.send (access to send message)
http://webinos.org/api/messaging.find (access to find message)
http://webinos.org/api/messaging.subscribe (access to message subscription)
http://webinos.org/api/messaging.attach (access to message attachment)

The control of message sending should be more restrictive than the others.

Applications will be granted access to this API without user consent being required. This can only be modified using a policy editor.
                                         Default allow (install time)        Widgets will need user consent at install time, but users will expect to allow it (the tick-box will automatically be filled in).                        Web pages will prompt for consent (Yes / No / Always) at runtime, this preference will be saved.
                                         Default ask at runtime (one-shot)   Widgets will require one-off user consent at runtime. This fact will be visible & modifiable at install time.
