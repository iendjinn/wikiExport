Policy Elements Context
=======================

How does context actually look like for the application developer?
------------------------------------------------------------------

Context information describes aspects of a situation from an actor/ entity point of view. The aspects are considered important and relevant as means to describe and capture the situation, and to be able to differentiate between the situations that occur for the actor/ entity.

Context is a class. Context is a hierarchic structure with attributes. The attributes all have names from a name space and a value. The values are instances of data primitives â€“ or other classes. There is a flexible storage and a data structure for context information. In webinos, application developers might want to have this storage not just locally on the device, but also to hook these up to clouds via cloudlets. This is where the synchronisation part comes in. Context can be used to capture and represent policies. Most context information can therefore be communicated using for instance XMPP messages, because the structure of these messages are also hierarchic.

The sources of context information can be sensors, actuators, or even humans keying/ contributing with the context information. Other sources can be methods within an application that derive the context information from various sources.

Access to the source of context information
-------------------------------------------

The implications of controlling the access to the source of context information is easy to understand. In webinos it is about allowing applications to have access to **read** the source. The Global Positioning Sensor (GPS) is a good example to explain the security and privacy issues in webinos. Historically, the GPS was designed for use by the military for navigation and monitoring purposes of assets and objects. Once the geo-coordinates of an asset or object has been identified; this information becomes highly valuable â€“ whether the coordinate is for a friendly asset or a target object/ foo.

Since then, the civil societies started to use GPS sensors for other purposes. The sensors have become standard in almost all smart phones available on the market. This means that it in general users of mobile phones are now more vulnerable for attacks compared to five years ago â€“ even fatal military ones. An application that has been designed to capture and share the geo-coordinates originating from the GPS sensor on the userâ€™s mobile device can be used for other purposes than the user and/or the application developer can think of. With the GPS sensor, access to the location information can be exploted on a massive scale to effectively track down people or their most recent whereabouts - regardless of whether the intent is good or bad. Opening up for remote access to the location information of a device, is the perfect backdoor for malicious attacks of various kinds targeting persons.

The user needs easy and instant control of the access to context information
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Policies for security and privacy need to be catered for in webinos. A dilemma is if the webinos runtime provides access to location information from remote, then we are suddenly even more unable to grasp the possible future intents of those wanting to access the location information of a specific user. The user needs to be in full control to stop such access, and we ought to help them make informed and quick decisions without any complex interaction or a longer tutorial on security and privacy policies.

Access to the context information storage
-----------------------------------------

Once context information is available from the source, applications will start to handle and use these. Context data originating from the source will need to be stored in temporary or permanent storage for the application to be able to remember and use it for computation. It is clear that the application having access to the source, also should be allowed/able to remember this context information. In the context of a navigation application, it would make sense to store the trace of geo-positions, e.g. from minute to minute to be able to compute where the user is heading, and also for instance to visualise where the user has been. This can either be done by keeping the data for instance in a context structure throughout the application session, or storing and recalling the context information between application sessions.

What is the userâ€™s intent when switching ON/OFF access to context information?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Imagine that a user has a trusted relationship to a social networking application that is keeping track of the location information and storing this between the application sessions. The user suddenly realises that all of the people she is connected to by the application can actually see and inspect where she has been throughout the week. In the beginning, she didnâ€™t think of it as an issue at all, because it was a cool feature. Now she has realised that the information should not be accessible for several of her friends. She wants to switch this OFF. She has currently become more privacy aware.

There are two options for her to switch OFF the access to the context information:

-   The application she is using actually allows for this from within the application
-   The webinos runtime allows for the access to the source of the context information to be switched OFF for all applications trying to access it

The problem she can encounter here is that she switches OFF the access to the source from the settings dashboard for the webinos runtime believing that this will do the trick for her. However, this means that the access to the storage of all her past contexts containing the tracked location information still is NOT actually switched OFF. The other problem she can encounter is if she instead attempts to switch this off from within the application. The application offers the possibility to switch OFF the access to all her location information that is stored, but it can NOT switch off the access to the source, because it this is controlled by the webinos runtime.

This leads to an important question about user expectations to security and privacy:

-   Does she mean switch OFF the access to the source AND/OR the access to any stored context information originating from the source?

This location information example is illustrative, because even though she has the intent to switch it off, she would have to be a seasoned in understanding the difference between the source and the storage of context information. She probably meant to switch OFF access to both â€“ or did she? Perhaps we should formulate a questionnaire in task 2.8 for a stock take on this?

Outlining a possible solution for security and privacy architecture using context information
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

When outlining the security and privacy architecture; it is the origin of context information, the storage of context information, and who controls the access to these. A solution is to isolate and relate contexts structures to applications. For instance, context information in a diabetes application makes no sense to use in a navigation application. So from an application developer point of view this should be a fine solution. This implies that a context structure used for one application not necessarily should be comparable at all with another context structure for another app. It is like comparing apples with pears.

One approach to take would be to require that all applications must have permission to access the context sources. Another solution would be to specify that all context sources are capable of being constrained by a policy, and then to come up with guidelines for sensible default values for which ones actually are.

To modularise and isolate context information for each application
------------------------------------------------------------------

If we follow such an approach, one could tie up certain context attribute to the runtime (i.e. system) for instance - or to a subset of apps. It would be reasonable to build solid walls/silos around context structures that are useful and relevant only for one application - or if necessary a subset of applications.

Inter-communication of context information across applications
--------------------------------------------------------------

To be able to compare and use context structures across applications, a name space for the attributes is therefore needed. In this way, two navigation applications could actually refer to and use the location attribute.

By using this approach also on the webinos runtime, this means that we can define some context attributes relevant for the runtime. If these are not found sufficient/ relevant for the application developer to use, which would happen in many cases, then the application developer is free to define his/her own context structure for their own apps.

The security concerns here is firstly how another application can obtain access to context information managed by another application. This can be done with a request for access to listen in on the context information from the application which is considered the source of the context information. The application being requested can choose to refuse or not reply to such a request from another application. The second, is once an application has granted access to the context information, and then the context information is shared via events. The content of these events need to be protected. If these events are based on XMPP, then the header information and the body needs to be protected and encrypted.

-   This needs to be addressed by the webinos event and messaging API.

Further discussions on relationship between policy and context-awareness
------------------------------------------------------------------------

-   We need to work out a common way of specifying that some (most?) contextual information has privacy considerations and therefore will need to be controlled by a layer of policy enforcement. A discussion on context-awareness and policy is needed soon to make progress.

-   Could it be reasonable to use the notion of services here, and assert that only services can provide access to the source(s) of context information?
