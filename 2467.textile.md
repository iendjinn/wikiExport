It makes use of the success and failure call back pattern. These call backs are defined in a subsequent section.

This method is used to establish a bidirectional channel with another NFC device for asynchronous exchange of data. It makes use of the Link Logical Control Protocol and exposes it as an HTML MessageChannel, see:

-   http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/comms.html

Each message channel exposes a pair of ports. The first port represents the local end of the channel, and the second port represents the remote end of the channel. Messages are posted between ports using the postMessage method. Messages can be strings or other kinds of JavaScript objects, and are serialized and reassembled automatically as structured clones, see:

-   http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/common-dom-interfaces.html#structured-clone

You can register a listener for notifications of incoming data. The channel is closed by calling the close method on the ports exposed by the message channel. For more details see the above link to the specification of the HTML MessageChannel.
