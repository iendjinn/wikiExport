Background information on new webinos APIs added in phase 2
===========================================================

This section describes the rationale behind each new API added in webinos phase 2.

The Generic Actuator API
------------------------

The webinos Generic Actuator API provides applications with an API to control actuators in the device, connected to the device or in another device. The API itself could be seen as opposite to the Generic Sensors API which only allows receiving data from sensors but today it becomes also more and more relevant to also influence the environment rather than just monitoring it. The actuator API allows to set values in order to change the state of an actuator and to influence the environment. Simple example would be just an actuator of type switch that would for example allow to turn on/off a light or a radiator or even to open/close a door. Thereby the actuator API provides a set of possible actuator types from switch through different types of motors up to thermostats.

Media Capture and Streams (previously named getUserMedia API)
-------------------------------------------------------------

For the second phase of the project it was decided to drop the referenced "Media Capture API":http://www.w3.org/TR/media-capture-api/ because of three reasons. First, the work on this specification from W3C side has been stopped and is not expected to be revived. No implementation of the original API was performed by the browser vendors. And finally, beside attempts to implement the Media Capture API for the Android platform, the API is not covered by any other platform in the current implementation of the webinos system. An appropriate substitution namely the "Media Capture and Streams":http://www.w3.org/TR/mediacapture-streams/ is now referenced as it promises a better acceptance and is already implemented by several Web browser vendors, on desktop and mobile. At the core the new referenced API provides access to the same functionality as the abandoned API did: capturing media. To align the webinos architecture the access to the capturing devices the services behind this API needs to be possible to invoke remotely. But it is strongly required to fulfil the Web browser security aspects by the service implementation as this API constitutes a potential privacy threat if capturing devices are activated without explicit user consent.

PeerConnection API (part of WebRTC)
-----------------------------------

The motivation for the PeerConnection API is mainly founded on the fact that relaying media content indirectly, via several entities like multiple personal zone hubs, is obviously ineffective, costly and impose extra latency that is not acceptable for conversational media streams. In correspondence to the "WebRTC":http://www.w3.org/TR/webrtc/ effort which the PeerConnection API is part of, a direct media communication between multiple Web runtimes may be possible. Besides sharing of media content, arbitrary data transmissions (peer to peer data channels) are discussed that could improve the responsiveness in near-realtime applications. The acceptant for the PeerConnection API is good among Web Browser vendors and several early implementations exist.

AppState Synchronization API
----------------------------

Developing distributed applications that run on several devices forces the developers to find ways to synchronize a set of variables representing (partly) the runtime state of the application. With the instruments provided by the first phase APIs the only choice is to use application specific events and the immersive utilization of the Event Handling API. A huge part of the app development is therefore event specification, which is a repetitive and error-prone task. It is desirable to mark a set of objects as being shared among multiple application instances (either of the same application or distinct) and have the webinos system synchronizing the objects among all participants automatically.

Access to Secure Elements
-------------------------

This provides access to contact and contactless smart cards via the APDU protocol conforming to ISO/IEC 7816-4.

APDU is a command response protocol for invoking functions executed on a smart card or similar device. In essence, the command consists of a 4 byte header followed by up to 255 bytes of data. The response contains a 2 byte header followed by up to 256 bytes of data. The headers and data are specified in a suite of standards from ISO and others. It also possible to develop custom secure elements using Java cards from companies such as G&D and Gemalto.

The aim is to give system applications written in JavaScript, and executing on a web run-time, a lightweight means to establish a channel with an application on a secure element, to send it commands, and handle the responses using byte arrays. Applications would have access to the crypto APIs being developed in the W3C Web Crypto WG. This work would feed into the W3C System Applications and NFC Working Groups.

Remote UI API
-------------

In a number of instances, applications need to provide simple user interfaces on remote devices. The typical case for that would be an application (like an e-mail program or a calendar reminder) presenting a notification on a TV. The TV viewer will probably not use the main program (e-mail or calendar) on the TV itself, but on some other device (tablet, laptop). While it is always possible to have an additional web app that just handles the notification display on a remote device (so an e-mail application could have the e-mail application and an additional e-mail notification app for the TV) and this is the preferred way for any complex interaction, there are many cases where notifications and inputs form are very limited in functionality and the need to provide second application and ensure that this is installed on the second device would introduce unnecessary complications. This is specifically the case in situations where notifications are very rare and the user (or application provider) does not see the need to install a secondary app on a target device. For example, an application that notifies the user of some critical condition of the car in the garage is likely to find that the counterpart of the application has not been properly installed on the TV.

Allowing remote access to the UI of a remote device allows applications to provide simple notifications and input forms on a remote device in an easy to use and providable way.

Navigation API
--------------

The Navigation API is a spin off the Vehicle API. Whereas the Vehicle API provides vehicle specific data, the Navigation API exposes the functionality to interact with a routing service. These services are not necessarily restricted to the vehicle environment and can be provided on smartphones as well. The methods have not been changed.

Web Notifications API
---------------------

The idea of the Web Notifications API is to show small notifications to the user in order to notify that "something" that could be of interest to the user has happened. During the first phase of the project this functionality was implemented in the webinos Widget API but recently W3C developed a specific API for notifications so we changed our specifications to use the W3C API. There were some changes made regarding security/privacy. The W3C API provides two functions to handle permission requests. These were removed within webinos in favour of using the webinos security and policy system.

  High level Requirements      Notes
  Display notification         An application wantâ€™s to notify that something happened to the user (new eMail, task completed, etc)
  Discard notification         The user should be able to discard the notification
  Accept notification          The user should be able to accept the notification (for example in order to activate the notifying application so that more details can be shown)
  Close a shown notification   An application should be able to close a shown notification, for example in order to update the notification with a newer one
