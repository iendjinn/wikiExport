-   Short overview of the webinos security and privacy architecture. After Berlin we have a much better view, so I will outline it to make sure we are all on the same page.
-   Introduction of the TNC MAP component to the security architecture (discussion and hopefully agreement â€“ phase 1 or phase 2).
-   Deliverable outline
    -   I will try to refactor the 3.5 deliverable outline in line with the rest of WP3 as soon as this is available, and discuss what will be in each section.
    -   Integrating the contents of the 3.1 Policy area outline into the deliverable.
    -   Integrating the contents of the 3.1 Identity management & authentication work. How does this fit into both 3.1 and 3.5 deliverables?
-   Outstanding work
    -   Security analysis of different work areas: still outstanding from Impleo, Sony Ericsson, DOCOMO, and more detail needed from BMW & W3C: http://dev.webinos.org/redmine/projects/t3-5/wiki/Links_To_Tasks
    -   Policy issues, as they appear on the policy wiki page - "Outstanding tasks" http://dev.webinos.org/redmine/projects/wp3-1/wiki/Policy_Management
    -   T3.2 Attestation API.
    -   Actually writing the deliverable
-   Any further business

Notes:
------

Privileged applications - need more examples. Comprehensive model required phase 2.
Pre-shared keys - action: investigate further (John and Andrea)
Nick:: Sanity checking of the runtime integrity ?
Default policies - security and privacy - both need defining

IF-MAP to be mentioned in phase 1 deliverable

Habib: comment on device discovery. Habib to make notes on some issues on T3.5 wiki

Friday afternoon deadline for partners to chose parts of the deliverable they can take responsibility for completing. Following this, John will allocate work areas to partners.
