Status Reports
--------------

### Browser Plugin (Simon)

Not much progress since Berlin

Urgent decision to be taken - who are we targeting - device manufacturers or 3rd party developer?

In case of manufacturers, just need to define how to define the extension such that manufacturer can build extension.
In case of developers - need to agree on how to expose them. Need to agree on Javascript ext.

Discussion on call: Need to focus on developers. Need to agree if we focus just on one technical solution (could be done in first phase and then extended in following phases)
Javascript easier, NPAPI would offer more solutions, but more complex
Question, if different needs for respectively platform owner vs developers.

Next: Simon to prepare a proposal for a technical solution for presentation in next CC

### Context Awareness and Adaptation (Dieter)

working on list of type of context awareness that can be stored, e.g. user profile, location, camera, etc.

### Overlay Network

not covered

### Policy Management (Salvatore)

proposal emerging - need to further discuss this

### Priv Apps (Krishna)

providing examples for app install, policy management, going to WAC and BONDI

### UI and Data Management (Andrea)

progressing with items established in Berlin
First use case available in diagram

Open Issues:
How to address users and devices, how to identify and authenticate them. Should the app request and get credentials or is it webinos which does all the identification and authentication under the hood? (Issue 10) In other words, on which layer does authentication live in webinos? application requests - runtime satisfies - to be written up
Privacy discovery dilemma
Further discussion in Berlin

h3. Analytics / Metrics (GeorgeV)

Small dependency with context
Assessing which data can be extracted, further contact with Hans

h3. App Packaging (Christian)

No open issue from Berlin

Work ongoing to put work into readable format

h3. Event Handling (Stefano)

Worked on prototype plug-in as proof-of-concept. Things going well

Main problem: resourcing problem, some topics may not be completedin deliverable by end of May: event format, RPC, publication/subscription, application-level event handling, device-local messaging, API attempt
not in deliverable by end of May: caching/storing/forwarding, network-level event exchange, security/policy considerations, UML diagrams.

Further work ongoing for 3.2, writing first API (expected in next days)

Basic questions: use XMPP for extensions for network- hope for clarification by next week. Many similarities between XMPP and event handling, need to take a choice

### Discovery (Habib)

On devices side looking into remote access.
Assessing if XMPP can fit into framework
Started on specification work
Questions to be addressed - how to handle policy & authentication as well as detection of social proximity
Decisions needed

How event handling works with service advertisement & notification? ( to communicate with event handling)
How should the device ID be represented to application and how it is mapped to user ID (to communicate with IDM)
Expose availability and capability on the network based on policy (to communicate with Policy management)
Find device based on certain criteria: descriptions of device & services â€“ properties & Context, e.g. social proximity. (to communicate with Context Management)
How does the webinos runtime expose capabilities from non-webinos devices in it’s LAN? A webinos enabled device may proxy services provided by non-webinos devices, e.g. devices that are attached using shortrange connectivity (eg. a Bluetooth connected GPS receiver).
Do we really need application IDs?
Use of XMPP server for local webinos server and remote webinos server ?
Is there a need of a server mode for local connections or will ad-hoc p2p connection be sufficient?
What information (security, policies, etc) is stored locally and what is stored on the webinos server and how is this information synchronized (see Identity & User Data work area)

Next /AOB
---------

Need specification by end of month (in 2 weeks)![]() Concerns about too many open issues / decisions to be taken and limited time â†’ recommendation to start writing specs already
