Agenda:
-------

### High Level Architecture:

Nick: what use cases are considering in device discovery, physical, remote or social proximity?
Habib: physical device (local) & remote device. Social proximity, not sure what context information we will have and where it comes from? Context management?
Nick: Draw Distinguish line between physical connections, social exploitation.
Habib: social proximity comes in the decision unit

Habib: Authentication server for local area?
Clases: How UPnP, zeroconfig works. Use cases, provider is not a server. Web introducer is high level and might be applicable in remote connection only.
Habib: We could try to use introducer as a registry to be used when devices are to be connected locally. It will act as a proxy to send indicates what is provided by each device i.e. TV provides screen while mobile phone acts as a keyboard, what service is provided by whom. Since it is peer to peer scenario it could be just a process doing this activity.

Nick: Draw a line between Application, functional API from certain implementation.
Claes: Agree with Nick. Will take an action on API for web introducer.
Habib: API/func arch should hide local discovery details.

Nick: is doing UC for ID management. Team circulate UC/scenario to share. Since defining covers all areas and might be used in device discovery too.

### Remaining Issues

Habib: Centralized or decentralized approach?
 Nick: as possible decentralized option.
Habib: suggested that XMPP is peer-to-peer approach.
Nick: agree.

Habib: User ID Management - Naming and addressing mechanism
Nick: universal script that translates, URI descriptor used by application developer with different underline implementation. Similar language, interpret URI of different scenarios.
AP: To define URI that would be translated from each

Habib: what Application discovery refers to?
Nick: A few scenarios - Nick to describe in writing. It is tied with services. WAC has some work to invoke remote application.
Habib: Security Aspects in discovery
Nick: Authentication (security) two elements. Need to define policy to mediate against discovery. It has to simple mechanism. Focus on architecture and add this to 2.6/2.8. Try to resolve possible attack and make assumptions.

Actions to take
---------------

-   Nick: circulate use case. describe application discovery
-   Claes: API input for webinos
-   Ziran: API/function architecture.
-   URI description at various stages (UpnP, ZeroConf, BT, XMPP)
-   Define expectations and Tasks on redmine
