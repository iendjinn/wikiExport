Application launch/bootstrap
----------------------------

![](Adaptation-AppStart.svg)

When an application is launched, it bootstraps webinos. Bootstrapping webinos will also entail starting the adaptation process - unless the application developer has disabled it explicitly in the application’s metadata. A first step is starting the Adaptation Client, which will fetch the application adaptation rules from the application’s package. Afterwards, it will connect to the Adaptation Manager in the PZP. The latter will then fetch the platform rules from the Adaptation Rule Engine.

For each rule, the adaptation manager analyzes the rule’s events and check the rule’s event type. It will feed the rule to an event type specific instance of the Rule Engine and register itself with the appropriate webinos service for a callback so it can launch the adaptation rule when the event occurs. For rules with the application.launch event, it will match the rules based on properties also fetched from webinos services. After analyzing all the rules, it will extract the actions to be performed and send them to the Adaptation Client, who will execute the adaptations.

An event is triggered.
----------------------

When an event is triggered, the API will trigger a callback function on each changed value for a certain property, e.g. the light sensor. The Adaptation Manager will activate the event type’s instance of the Rule Engine to analyze the rule and fire the adaptation rule if the value falls within the range of the event and the conditions are met.
