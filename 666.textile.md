=================================================================

We use Git for source control management. **For general Git installation and usage please see "Using Git":http://dev.webinos.org/redmine/projects/wp-0/wiki/Using_Git.**

Checking out
------------

-   The T3.2 repository is at http://dev.webinos.org/git/t3-2.git - there is also a web interface "here":http://dev.webinos.org/redmine/projects/t3-2/repository
-   Clone the repository to your workstation, this will give you the tree as described in [[IDL Tool Chain instructions]]. Authenticate with your redmine username.
-   Work on some web IDL file or add a new one, again see [[IDL Tool Chain instructions]].
-   Commit the changes to your local clone of the repository.
-   Push the changes in your local repository to the remote repository on dev.webinos.org.
-   Or pull changes from the remote repository to your local repository to see changes others have made.

HTML draft specifications - http://dev.webinos.org/specifications/draft/
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Once you pushed your changes to the remote repository the server will generated new HTML files based on your changes which will be published at http://dev.webinos.org/specifications/draft/

Note: It is **important** that everybody who commits makes absolutely sure that their edits leave **valid** widl files behind as otherwise the HTML generation wonâ€™t be successful. **So make sure to run the webinos.sh script locally to test the HTML generation.**
