Privacy Policy Architecture
---------------------------

### Introduction

User privacy in webinos is provided by description in human-readable form how sensitive information in managed; this allows users to limit tracking of their behaviour.

To achieve these goals, webinos will support two privacy-enhancing features:

* Do not track header
 * Subset of P3P in JSON

### Threats to privacy

There are numerous threats to user privacy, many of which are outlines in Deliverable 2.8. For this deliverable we have focused on the issues described in the table below:

  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- -- -------------------------------------------------- ----------------------------------------------------------------------
  **Threat**                                                                                    **Possible control**                                                                                                                                                                                        Applications given too much personal information   Access to user data and APIs must be constrained (see Security API).
  Applications given personal information which is used in an unexpected manner                 Privacy policies are key here to regulating this.
  Weak security controls give applications access to information that users are unhappy with.   Robust security controls
  Personal data is linked and combined in unexpected ways                                       Context data could be misused - this is a key part of the webinos architecture and an opportunity for privacy violations if data are shared inappropriately, provide controls to rectify these issues.

 * Guidelines from the Tor project for Privacy by Design to avoid tracking ([[Deliverable_References#Perry2011|Perry2011]])
 * Mozilla Privacy Roadmap 2011 ([[Deliverable_References#MozillaPrivacyRoadmap|MozillaPrivacyRoadmap]])

### Components

#### Do Not Track

This is an HTTP header that informs a website/application that the user doesn’t want to be tracked. The precise syntax of the header, and the semantics are still under discussion, and likely to be standardized by W3C in the near future.

#### Subset of P3P in JSON

This enables the application/website to define what classes of data will be collected, the retention policy, and who the data will be shared with. A subset of P3P is chosen to enable easy rendering of policies and differences between a policy and the user’s preferences, as well as a simple UI for the user preferences. The policy links to a full human readable policy. Policies can be discovered via an HTTP Link header and/or an HTML link element. This approach is combined with white/black lists and a means to consult a third party for an independent assessment. A proof of concept implementation is available from the PrimeLife project.

Privacy policies will be directly linked to the application "feature" requests in the manifest. Each feature tag will have an associated section in the privacy policy. Privacy policies will be located in an additional file in the web application package.

#### Privacy and Personal Zones

The Personal Zone keeps track of personal information, and needs to protect this. This builds upon earlier work on synchronizing browser contexts to give users access to their bookmarks and recorded preferences when logging into a browser session from a new computer. The context is stored in an encrypted form (see "Secure Storage"), and care is needed for the management of the decryption key. For browser context synchronisation, the key doesn’t need to be stored on the server, as the encrypted data is downloaded by the browser and decrypted locally using a key derived from the user’s credentials. For webinos, you can grant other people access to personal data held on your Personal Zone Hub based upon your relationship to that person. The Personal Zone Hub stores the keys to personal data in an encrypted form as a defense against the situation where an attacker gains access to the server’s files. This necessitates a bootstrap process where the server first verifies the integrity of the software used to implement the Personal Zone Hub, and then passes the Hub’s master keys to it in a secure way.

A personal profile might be kept by the Personal Zone Hub as a basis for ranking matches during a federated search for a given user, where the search performed collectively by the set of personal zone hubs reachable from the personal graph for the user initiating the search. The search process will be designed to preserve privacy by minimizing data leakage.

### Applications that adapt to context

Applications benefit from being able to access the context describing user preferences, device capabilities and environmental conditions, as this enables the application to adapt to changing circumstances. Such access is subject to prior agreement by the user concomitant with the application agreeing to data handling obligations as part of its privacy policy.

### Reviewing and revoking recorded permissions

Webinos will provide the means for users to review and if desired to revoke recorded permissions relating to personal data, e.g. access to the user’s location.

### Future directions

In future releases of these specifications, webinos authentication and privacy policies will be able to be informed by social networks and relationships. For example, one possibility involves users being able to set access control rules on a personal basis, or on the basis of the "face" they present to their contacts, e.g. immediate friends, work colleagues and the general public. In such instances, webinos will be able to warn users of potential loss of privacy when the same contacts are present in multiple faces, e.g. when the user posts content to immediate friends, one of whom is a work colleague.
