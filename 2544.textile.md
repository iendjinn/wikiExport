Webinos API specifications further work
=======================================

General
-------

The D3.4 does not mean that we stop working in the API specifications. There will be a need to continuously evaluate or API specifications and further develop them. This will for example be based on:

-   Errors found.
-   Implementation experiences.
-   Evolvement of the webinos architecture.
-   Ongoing standardization. Especially consider the new W3C working groups System Applications and NFC that are chartered to define an execution model and APIs that are very relevant for webinos.

A process must be defined to handle further work on API specifications and to assure that the specifications are aligned with the webinos platform implementation.

Moving API specification source repository to Github
----------------------------------------------------

-   New location: https://github.com/webinos/webinos-api-specifications. Specification update process to be defined.
-   Usage of Jira: http://jira.webinos.org/browse/API

Use of feature strings for API access control versus discovery.
---------------------------------------------------------------

Each API specification defines a set of feature strings that are used for API access control as well as identifier of the service type/API with the ServiceType parameter in the findServices() API. However, it is currently unclear if all feature strings could be used for discovery.

The following proposals have been raised:

1.  Use different features; this means that, for example, Salvatore can discover Nickâ€™s gallery service but may be unable to access it. In this case we should add a feature to all apis (the feature for discovery);
2.  Use the same feature; this means that you can discover only services that you can access;
3.  The features needed for discovery should be a subset of the ones needed for access control; for example messaging defines 5 features to access different functionalities but only one can be enough to allow/deny discovery;

Aligment with Web Intents.
--------------------------

W3C, Google and others are moving towards Web Intents. The webinos project must align with this in the best possible manner. See "Web Intents for Webinos investigation":http://dev.webinos.org/redmine/projects/t3-4/wiki/Web_Intents_for_Webinos_investigation

Consistent design of event based APIs.
--------------------------------------

The style of event based APIs in for example the webinos Generic Sensor API was inspired by the W3C DeviceOrientation Event specification. However, this style has now been abandoned by W3C. See section 4.2 of "Web API Design Cookbook":http://darobin.github.com/api-design-cookbook/.

Instead align with the style in W3C DAP’s small sensor specific APIs for battery, ambient light, proximity etc.

See http://dom.spec.whatwg.org/#defining-event-interfaces for advice.

Evaluate based on implementation experiences.

Issues on specific APIs
-----------------------

### Telephone API

Was not specified in task 3.4 but is needed for webinos. Consider work on this API in W3C System Applications WG.

### W3C Calendar API

http://www.w3.org/TR/2011/WD-calendar-api-20110419/

Has been shelved by DAP WG. See http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-device-apis/2012Oct/0008.html.

### Context API

Addition of functionality for privacy aware location and proximity. Victor to coordinate with NTUA

### Sensor API

-   Alignment with W3C sensor specific APIs, use discrete APIs instead of a generic API?

-   Addition of M2M sensors

### Messaging API

-   Editorial / style corrections:
    -   Use enums instead of constants
    -   Use DOM errors
    -   Interface MessageFilter should be Dictionary (see WAC Messaging)
    -   sendMessage error callback should be optional

To be submitted as input to W3C SysApps, phase 1

Other API specification initiatives, in addition to W3C, to monitor
