User profile and context APIs
=============================

Description
-----------

This section contains investigation results on user profile APIs and context APIs.

The user profile API defines attributes and methods to access to user related information (e.g. name, nickname, gender birthday, etc.) while the application data API provide information about application related information (e.g. installed application).

Analysis of requirements from WP2.2
-----------------------------------

The table below lists relevant requirements identified in WP2.2 and the compliance status based on current proposal.

|**Requirement**|**Description**|**Compliance Status**|**Notes**|
|CAP-DEV-SEMC-010|webinos SHALL provide means for applications to access userâ€™s profile data.|**Phase 1**||
|CAP-DEV-SEMC-011|webinos SHALL provide means for applications to access userâ€™s preference data|Phase 2|An secure and optimal method to store user preferences must be found to provide privacy aspects and avoid a blow up of user preferences (e.g. different applications would like to store the same information in the user preferences -> ColorBlind:RedGreen is the same as ColorBlind:GreenRed).|
|ID-USR-POLITO-100|webinos components that have to be shared or referenced (device, application, data, user) SHALL be identifiable.|**Phase 1**|The user profile has a unique id.|
|DA-DEV-ambiesense-040|It MUST be possible for applications to share context information across devices, so that for instance social context can be updated when friends enter/ leave the same situation. |Phase 2|In phase 1 the user profile API implements social contact information. Further contextual information must be evaluated for phase 2.|
|PS-DEV-Oxford-86|The webinos runtime SHALL support the confidential storage of user credentials including usernames and passwords.|Phase 2|A secure method to store login credentials must be evaluated for phase 2.|
|PS-USR-IBBT-005|The webinos system SHOULD store associations between device, user and context information securely and provide this information based on user preferences.|Phase 2|Same as CAP-DEV-SEMC-011.|
|PS-USR-VisionMobile-10|webinos SHALL allow users to express their privacy preferences in a consistent way.|Phase 2|Same as CAP-DEV-SEMC-011.|
|PS-USR-VisionMobile-11|webinos applications SHALL be able to query the webinos user privacy preferences.|Phase 2|Same as CAP-DEV-SEMC-011.|
|NC-DEV-IBBT-0015|Applications MUST be able to access the user’s general webinos preferences (with the permission of the user).|Phase 2|Same as CAP-DEV-SEMC-011.|

Phase 1 APIs
------------

APIs for which no existing standards/implementations exist
----------------------------------------------------------

### User Profile API

**Description:** User Information
**Requirement/architectural reference:

** CAP-DEV-SEMC-010: Webinos SHALL provide means for applications to access userâ€™s profile data.
* ID-USR-POLITO-100: webinos components that have to be shared or referenced (device, application, data, user) SHALL be identifiable.

**Phase:** Webinos phase 1
**Webinos responsible:** Ronny GrÃ¤fe / George Gionis
|**Candidate API**|**Short Description**|**Implementation Status**|**Gaps**|**Notes**|**Decision**|
| "W3C Contacts API":http://dev.w3.org/2009/dap/contacts/ |Contacts provides a basic list of information about a person, but is insufficient for webinos needs.|Contacts provide only ‘real life’ information about a user, but no technical information (like preferences). It also doesn’t allow granularity of access. And has no specific API for the user (as opposed to other contacts).|||Decision was made to build own API for webinos, based on elements from Contact and Portable Contacts. See note below table.|
| "Portable Contacts":http://portablecontacts.net/draft-spec.html |The reference presented by George Gionis added account information for user accounts for external social network profiles, which is useful for context awareness and calculation of social proximity. We can base user profile information on the account information suggested by portable contacts..||||Decision was made to build own API for webinos, based on elements from Contact and Portable Contacts. See note below table.|

The data accessible through the API for user profiles will be based on the W3C contacts information with additional information for social network profiles based on Portable Contacts.

Phase 2 APIs

* PS-DEV-Oxford-86: The webinos runtime SHALL support the confidential storage of user credentials including usernames and passwords.
* PS-USR-IBBT-005: The webinos system SHOULD store associations between device, user and context information securely and provide this information based on user preferences.
