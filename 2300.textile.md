Reported potential attacks
==========================

Introduction
------------

This page documents potential attacks and issues that have come up through discussion and have not been incorporated into the overall process.

Payment/Authentication and SMS interception
-------------------------------------------

<span style="background:green">Now covered in an attack pattern</span>

The webinos platform allows users to access SMS data. An application which can access SMS data and send SMS could intercept and reply to out-of-band payment and authentication requests. E.g.,

-   Justin installs malicious application "MalApp", which requires access to a long list of APIs.
-   MalApp pretends to offer low-cost products or services, and then invokes the payment API
-   Justin fills in his payment details.
-   Through clickjacking, or some other means, MalApp charges the user Â£1000 rather than the Â£10 he expects.
-   The payment provider authenticates transactions through an out-of-band SMS message to Justin’s registered telephone number. This SMS would alert Justin to the excessive charge.
-   MalApp intercepts the SMS message and (if required) replies to it confirming the transaction
-   Justin remains unaware of the authentication process and the money is transferred.

API policy avoidance through existing browser-provided APIs
-----------------------------------------------------------

<span style="background:green">Now covered in an attack pattern</span>

An application wants to collect location data from Gloria. However, she would prefer not to provide it, perhaps because she is on holiday and does not want to tell her work colleagues or strangers that she is away from home. She sets her devices to deny location service requests.

The application receives the "location denied" response, and instead invokes the in-built browser Geolocation API. Not being mediated by the same policy, this had already been authorised to do this, and reveals Gloria’s location to the application.

Re-identification through the ‘findservices’ call
-------------------------------------------------

<span style="background:green">Now covered in an attack pattern</span>

A ‘flashlight’ application is installed by Peter on his mobile device. It requests access to the Actuator API so that it can control some of the LEDs on the mobile. Peter approves the request and uses the application regularly. It occasionally shows adverts to Peter when it starts up - this doesn’t bother him.

Peter is using other applications for online shopping and is considering buying a present for his girlfriend - an expensive diamond ring. He decides not to.

He and his girlfriend are walking home, when Peter decides to use the ‘flashlight’ application to help their journey. He passes it to his girlfriend, who starts the application. It immediately displays an advert: "Peter, you’ve been looking at diamond rings. Why not buy one from DiamondCo Ltd?." Peter now has some explaining to do…

This happens because the flashlight application has an identifier for Peter’s PZP. This is the same identifier as he uses on online shopping applications. They can therefore target adverts to him, despite Peter never giving the flashlight application any information about who he is.

API-proxying through inter-app communication
--------------------------------------------

<span style="background:green">Now covered in an attack pattern</span>

Any application can act as a proxy for the API permissions it has been granted. If App A has access to the Messaging API, then App B can potentially make use of it through any of the interfaces provided by App A, intentionally or otherwise. The same problem is apparent in Android apps - transitive permissions cause privilege escalation - http://www.trust.rub.de/research/publications/DDSW10/

Misidentification of a PZH through disconnected TLS and HTTPS certificates.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

<span style="background:orange">Listed in the deliverable - [[D036 Draft Attacks]]</span>

At present, enrolment to a PZH happens through visiting a PZH provider webpage and then some magic APIs are called. However, there’s no connection between the PZH TLS certificate and the web certificate used to present the PZH web interface. This means that the last part of the exchange can be re-routed by a man-in-the-middle attack.

Malicious service misuse
------------------------

<span style="background:orange">Listed in the deliverable - [[D036 Draft Attacks]]</span>

An application uses the findService() call to find services of a particular type. It is expected that applications will then present these services to the user for them to select.

However, an application doesn’t need to obey the user’s intentions, and might invoke a different service to the one selected. Indeed, this might be because the user is intentionally _not_ selecting a service with security constraints.

The policy system can only handle this if policies refer to services not API types + devices. This may not be the case.

The webinos botnet.
-------------------

<span style="background:orange">Listed in the deliverable - [[D036 Draft Attacks]]</span>

Webinos is used to create a botnet! Lots of possibilities…

An implementation flaw is exploited in the renderer, which abuses its trusted relationship with the PZP somehow
A method of enrolling rogue devices into personal zones allows someone to own zones en-masse.
A PZP implementation flaw is exploited by an application
Device malware steals PZP credentials and hijacks the zone

A webinos-enabled botnet could leech data from the whole zone and then be used for massive DDoS attacks.

TLS certificate management errors

Remote JavaScript includes
--------------------------

<span style="background:orange">Listed in the deliverable - [[D036 Draft Attacks]]</span>

Taken from "You Are What You Include: Large-scale Evaluation of Remote JavaScript Inclusions":http://seclab.cs.ucsb.edu/media/uploads/papers/jsinclusions.pdf

Remotely including javascript in web applications is dangerous as it is a trust assumption many developers don’t consider. Attacking one common inclusion provider could attack multiple applications.

OpenID provider flaws
---------------------

<span style="background:orange">Listed in the deliverable - [[D036 Draft Attacks]]</span>

I can’t find the paper anymore, but various OpenID providers have had vulnerabilities allowing for identify theft.

Misidentification of users requesting inter-zone certificate exchange
---------------------------------------------------------------------

<span style="background:orange">Listed in the deliverable - [[D036 Draft Attacks]]</span>

Is it possible to ask for certificate exchange while pretending to be a different person?
