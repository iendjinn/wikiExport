CF: At the moment, this section looks primarily like a ‘quick example note’ version of the section that’s needed. First of all, there needs to be some description of what types of microPZP scenarios exist, essentially establishing in which cases a microPZP is needed and why a full PZP is not appropriate here. And only **then** should there be a number of specific examples for scenarios using microPZP, And they should specifically relate to the reasons given for a microPZP usage in the introduction part. There should also be a clear difference between cases where a microPZP should be used (usually an autonomous system that has not quite enough capabilities to run a full PZP) and cases where sensors are logically just extensions of normal PZPs. The Bluetooth heart-rate monitor, for example, does not really represent a microPZP scenario - from the architectural view, the device is just a sensor connected ‘semi-magically’ to the PZP of the phone. An application would be unable to distinguish between a heart-rate sensor built into the phone and one connected via Bluetooth - so it’s not an example of a microPZP. A microPZP is a stand-alone PZP, just with a limited functionality set due to technical limitations. Especially the first example even specifically mentions using an existing PZP and a "mobile based gateway", so it’s pretty much an example of a non-microPZP scenario. The second example (parking sensor) fares slightly better, but only if it is specifically stated that the individual ‘sensors’ are fairly smart sensors with their own addressibility and computing facility. If they are just connected to a central server, then they are just ‘dumb’ sensors and will be served by the PZP of that server. I think the idea behind the scenario is that all sensors are connected to one router, so the sensors by themselves are ‘dumb’, but the router acts as a PZP, but due to the fact that the router is limited in capability can only host a limited version of the PZP, hence a microPZP. But that needs to be more explicitly stated or the example is confusing.

Smart health scenario
=====================

In the smart health, patients can get some benefit from continuous long-term monitoring as a part of a diagnostic procedure through the use of body sensor network, which is composed of different sensors such as ECG,EEG,PPG to monitor patient’s body information like blood, heart beat. The sensor motes in the body sensor network is wearable, so it is very tiny, small embedded on the cloths or even underneath the skin, thus they are usually constrained not only by their size but also computation,power,memory capability, they are in our case, the microPZP. In order to forward the health data to the data center, a more powerful device is needed such as mobile phone, which is considered as a PZP.
Via PZP (mobile based gateway), it is possible to connect the body sensor network to internet. All the health data are sent to the internet hub, which is the PZH. By exchanging the permissions, doctors can check the patients’ condition much easier unmanned, such as temperature, pulse, etc. In the M2M, doctors use smart phones, pads or computers to get patients’ information and the messages flow is described in Figure 2. Doctor runs web browser or application software of watcher(e.g., smart phone, pad and computer) to check the patient’s condition.

In this scenario, data confidentiality and authentication matters more for the microPZP.

Smart parking scenario
----------------------

Parking sensors embedded in the pavement of the selected parking spaces detect when a space is available. The parking sensor normally is based on magnetic sensor, which can detect low earth magnetic level affected by the metal material in the car. To increase the precision, infrared sensor is used as well. These sensor platform is forming a mesh wireless sensor network. smart routers communicate with sensors to aggregate sensor data and the same time communicate with the cloud center to deliver the availability of the parking spots. The intelligent network platform captures the data and publishes it into free mobile application, which displays real-time availability of these on-street spaces as well as locations of off-street parking garages and lots along with other information such as pricing and enforcement hours.

In this scenario, The parking sensors in the mesh network is the microPZP, and the smart routers is the PZP acting as the gateway, and cloud center is the PZH. The security issue on the microPZP is not only the data confidentiality, device authentication, but also to prevent theft and to avoid anyone impersonating the device to connect to the rest of the network.
