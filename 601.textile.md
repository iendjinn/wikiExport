Agenda
------

### Intro / Management

- anyone having problems keeping redmine tasks up to date?
no

- any requirements on logistical/tools front
no

- need to start structuring deliverable….
 - sections - specfication type - examples
Â· Browser plug-in / extension handling (Simon)

Simon: NPAPI done
Nick todo: local web server approach…
Nick suggestion to:
 - coordinate with discovery, policy mechanis…

### User ID and Data Management (Sven/Andrea)

second draft architecture on redmine: http://dev.webinos.org/redmine/projects/wp3-1/wiki/Use_Cases
Link: http://dev.webinos.org/redmine/attachments/466/webinos_AA_proposal_v2.ppt
example of activity diagram: http://dev.webinos.org/redmine/projects/wp3-1/wiki/Scenario1Sequence

Sven: next week to talk to other subject areas when the interaction diagrams are complete.

Next call on friday….

Request:
Overlay/discovery… Ziran todo… Dave todo
Crypto means for addressing slide no 23…

### Context (Hans/GeorgeG)

http://dev.webinos.org/redmine/projects/wp3-1/wiki/Context_Management
Heiko: contact other groups to interface with context management framework
Examine Serenoa….

### Policy Management (Davide/Salvatore)

http://dev.webinos.org/redmine/projects/wp3-1/wiki/Policy_Architecture

Todo: talk to the extension handling
ID management : post fri - policy managent co-ordination…
Todo: context heikko.

### Device, Service, and Application Discovery (Ziran)

http://dev.webinos.org/redmine/projects/wp3-1/wiki/30_March_-_05_April



h3. Web Application handling (Andre)

To follow up with andre

h3. Privileged Applications (Krishna)

http://dev.webinos.org/redmine/projects/wp3-1/wiki/%27Privilege_Apps_and_Services_related_to_Browser_and_Policies%27

Background work done.

Trust boundary, integrity checks, and sensitve apis to be

Todo: Use cases to be created
Todo: Polito to produce sequence diagrams.

h3. Event Handling (Stefano/Marco)

Fundamantal question: is RPC part of event handling.
Todo: start some real coding to explore solution methods.
Â· Overlay Networking model (Dave)


Hands on work on discovery which is leading to an investigation of what role the overlay model can provide for simplifying discovery given variations in vocabulary and assumptions across different discovery mechanisms. Looking at NAT traversal and role of personal zone in establishing logical peer to peer connections independent of NAT/Firewall boundaries. This will lead to hands on work on identity based upon social networks.

h3. Analytics

- nick: todo - host call

- Proposal to rename to metering - georgev: (metrics? not overly religious bout it, but came across â€œmetricsâ€ as a term of the â€œraw measurable dataâ€ collected for the purpose of analytics. and sounds nice…)
- All subject areas to create - hot list of meterable events - georgev: (events, data snapshots / states, capability to define signatures a la IDS, i.e. detect sequence of events/statuses)
- policy to grant permission for entities to monitor
- default privacy settings to mask as much of everything else
- legal T&Cs to back it up georgev: can check if we (VM) have bwidth to do this
- georgev: define how far into the server-side webinos analytics go. (e.g. define transport/intermediate storage, end repository? that would create ownership issues)

- georgev: proposal to do an review of commercial solutions? but probly not within scope of wp3…
review use cases/stories for analytics related issues? â€œcontextâ€ work may provide a good â€œcase studyâ€ for one application of analytics)

### 3.2 APIs Update (Claes)

Call tomorrow…
Lots in input received.
Requirements and use cases needed for non exising apis.
Specification work to start

### Tools (Nick/Daniel)

- Git progress?
- Install Daniels:

- Javascript stub examples……
 Decision on tools: 3.1 wiki
recommend: Claes review daniels tool chain and either endorse or make alternative proposal
recommend Stafano and Ziran review WebIDL for applicability to discovery and eventing mechansism
 - unlikely to user webidl directly. but possibly can user derivatives
 - requirement - discovery: must be able to return at runtime list of methods and parameters
 - requrement - eventing - must at runtime be able to create stubs and servers that correspond to teh webidl descriptions.

### Wrap up

- meeting timing
berlin f2f: may 3rd may 5th.. :2.5 day meeting, starting on Tuesday, May 3rd, at 10 am and finishing on Thursday, May 5th, around 2 pm.
