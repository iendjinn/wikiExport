Introduction
============

In this document we define the security architecture for the webinos project. The webinos project aims to deliver a cross-device web application runtime environment, providing inter-device communication and interaction. The development of this runtime environment will help to provide a seamless end-user experience with web applications. The webinos consortium aims to make several innovations in the runtime environment, and, as a research project, it aims to go beyond the current state of the art in web application technology. The majority of the specification work is being carried out in two other documents: the System Specification ([[Deliverable_References#Webinos-D31|Webinos-D31]]) and API Specification ([[Deliverable_References#Webinos-D32|Webinos-D32]]).

One of the most important areas for improvement in existing web application technology is the provision of better security and privacy. webinos-enabled web applications will be able to support important and high value functionality such as electronic payment and may store confidential and valuable information belonging to companies or individuals. At the same time, vulnerabilities in web technology are being discovered regularly, with large projects such as OWASP ([[Deliverable_References#OWASP|OWASP]]) dedicated to cataloguing and mitigating the most common and severe. Furthermore, user privacy is an increasing concern, and mobile applications frequently appear in the news for violating user expectations for how their data are collected and used ([[Deliverable_References#Leyden2011|Leyden2011]]).

A key challenge facing the webinos project is that existing threats to security and privacy could potentially have a greater impact on webinos than on existing systems, due to the capability for cross-device interaction and standardised architecture. From the outset we have been aware that an insecure webinos platform could result in the creation of cross-device malware. This malware could capture sensitive private information or commercially valuable data or even create a large, cross-platform botnet capable of launching denial of service attacks against people and organisations. These threats are real, and must be solved in the webinos architecture. The webinos project has therefore been considering security and privacy issues from the beginning, and this document represents the first iteration of the webinos security and privacy architecture.

There is another compelling reason for the creation of a webinos security and privacy architecture: the standardisation of security and privacy controls and interfaces which will increase usability and reduce development effort. At present, each device manufacturer provides different interfaces and conceptual models for securing applications and protecting users. This makes the task of securing all personal devices challenging for users. By unifying the interface and allowing the management of security policies on all devices to be done on the most appropriate platform (on a device with a large screen and keyboard, for example) users will be able to make better decisions than they can at present. This document therefore describes a security and privacy architecture capable of providing standardised access controls and features applicable to all four device domains.

Document Structure and Scope
----------------------------

This document is structured in the following way. The rest of this section covers the methodology used to create the security and privacy architecture, principles followed and provides a high-level overview of the architecture itself. The background section discusses related security architectures, including Android, BONDI, iOS and WebOS, and analyses what can be learned from them. An initial threat overview is then given, including the top ten relevant threats from the OWASP project and early results from task 2.8 where the main threat analysis is taking place. The architecture section contains requirements and specifications for security and privacy-related components of the webinos architecture, and is the main contribution of this document. It includes details on the following components:

-   the security policy architecture;
-   the privacy policy architecture;
-   authentication and user identity management;
-   runtime authorisation;
-   privileged applications;
-   secure storage;
-   security for extensions;
-   personal zone security;
-   platform integrity protection, resilience and attestation;
-   application certification, installation and trust;
-   device permissions; and
-   session security.

The next section discusses guidelines for the implementation of the webinos platform, with particular guidance for privacy and secure development of the network architecture, communication and the runtime itself. This is followed by a discussion of the cloud security models which are relevant to webinos. Following this, the [[Deliverable_Security_Requirements_Updates|Updates to Security Requirements]] section contains a list of new or modified requirements which were identified when creating the security architecture. We then conclude and give guidance on how best to use this document.

This security and privacy architecture document is not designed to be read on its own, and frequently refers to previous webinos documentation, including specification deliverables 3.1 and 3.2, the requirements in deliverable 2.2 and the user expectations work in deliverable 2.7 and early results from 2.8. Deliverable D3.1 in particular must be read before this document in order to introduce the key webinos system components. Due to the overlap between the system specification ([[Deliverable_References#Webinos-D31|Webinos-D31]]) and this document, some of the key architectural components are presented more thoroughly in the other document. This is because they are fundamental to the design of the system and cannot be separated from it. This includes the sections on security policies, authentication, messaging, and privileged applications.

Methodology
-----------

The webinos security architecture was developed using the following methodology. Importantly, we aimed to keep security aligned with the rest of the specification efforts, so that insecure designs were identified and avoided early on in the planning phase of the project. We took several measures to make this happen:

1.  Every area of the specification in ([[Deliverable_References#Webinos-D31|Webinos-D31]]) involved a partner with security expertise who was also involved in the security and privacy work.
2.  We kept track of emerging security and privacy issues in the specification work using the project wiki and discussed them on frequent conference calls and meetings.
3.  We used the Personas defined in ([[Deliverable_References#Webinos-D27|Webinos-D27]]) as authorities to make security and privacy design decisions.
4.  We used the misuse cases and environment models developed in ([[Deliverable_References#Webinos-D28|Webinos-D28]]) to identify new threats and potential vulnerabilities.

Throughout the design of the webinos security architecture, we also tried to follow well-established guidelines and principles. These have been drawn from academic literature and were followed throughout the duration of the development of the webinos platform.

### Security Principles.

The following security patterns are from ([[Deliverable_References#Garfinkel2005|Garfinkel2005]]).

-   _Good Security Now (Donâ€™t Wait for Perfect)_. Ensure that systems offering some security features are deployed now, rather than leaving these systems sitting on the shelf while â€œperfectâ€ security systems are being developed for the future.
-   _Provide Standardized Security Policies (No Policy Kit)_. Provide a small number of standardized security conï¬gurations that can be audited, documented, and
    taught to users.
-   _Least Surprise / Least Astonishment_. Ensure that the system acts in accordance with the userâ€™s expectations.
-   _Explicit User Audit_. Allow the user to inspect all user-generated information stored in the system to see if information is present and verify that it is accurate. There should be no hidden data.
-   _Explicit Item Delete_. Give the user a way to delete what is shown, where it is shown.
-   _Reset to Installation_. Provide a means for removing all personal or private information associated with an application or operating system in a single, conï¬rmed, and ideally delayed operation
-   _Complete Delete_. Ensure that when the user deletes the visible representation of something, the hidden representations are deleted as well
-   _Leverage Existing Identiï¬cation_. Use existing identiï¬cation schemes, rather than trying to create new ones.
-   _Create Keys When Needed_. Ensure that cryptographic protocols that can use keys will have access to keys, even if those keys were not signed by the private key of a well-known Certiï¬cate Authority
-   _Track Received Key_. Make it possible for the user to know if this is the ï¬rst time that a key has been received, if the key has been used just a few times, or if it is used frequently.
-   _Migrate and Backup Key_. Prevent users from losing their valuable secret keys.
-   _Disclose Signiï¬cant Deviations_. Inform the user when an object (software or physical) is likely to behave in a manner that is signiï¬cantly different than expected. Ideally the disclosure should be made by the objectâ€™s creator.
-   _Install Before Execute_. Ensure that programs cannot run unless they have been properly installed.
-   _Distinguish Between Run and Open_. Distinguish the act of running a program from the opening of a data ï¬le.
-   _Disable by Default_. Ensure that systems does not enable services, servers, and other signiï¬cant but potentially surprising and security-relevant functionality unless there is a need to do so.
-   _Warn When Unsafe_. Periodically warn of unsafe conï¬gurations or actions. It is important to limit the frequency of warnings so that the user does not become habituated to them.
-   _Distinguish Security Levels_. Give the user a simple way to distinguish between similar operations that are more-secure and less-secure. The visual indications should be consistent across products, packages and vendors.

The following are more general, and many have been taken from the classic Saltzer and Schroeder paper ([[Deliverable_References#Saltzer75|Saltzer75]]).

-   _Economy of mechanism_: Keep the design as simple and small as possible. Prefer the most simple option available during design.
-   _Fail-safe defaults_: Base access decisions on permission rather than exclusion.
-   _Least privilege_: Every program and every user of the system should operate using the least set of privileges necessary to complete the job. This is often not possible, but is particularly relevant when designing components which are large enough to be considered potentially untrustworthy. E.g. a browser. They should be given the minimum privilege possible so that compromise has the least impact.
-   _Compromise recording_: It is sometimes suggested that mechanisms that reliably record that a compromise of information has occurred can be used in place of more elaborate mechanisms that completely prevent loss.
-   Do not reinvent the wheel: use existing technology where possible.
-   Reduce the number and size of trusted components.
-   Isolate individual components where possible.

### Privacy principles

We aimed to avoid the following five Privacy Pitfalls ([[Deliverable_References#Lederer04|Lederer04]]) in webinos:

-   obscuring potential information flow;
-   obscuring actual information flow;
-   emphasizing configuration over action;
-   lacking coarse-grained control; and
-   inhibiting existing practice.

In addition, we also took advantage of the wealth of information available from the OWASP project ([[Deliverable_References#OWASP|OWASP]]) and in the [[Deliverable_Background|Background section]] of this document we have listed the top ten threats and identified how they relate to the webinos platform.

High-level Overview of the Security Architecture
------------------------------------------------

The webinos security and privacy model consists of many components, processes and guidelines. This section provides a brief overview of how they fit together and describes the components which are responsible for securing each part of the system. Our initial approach was to start with concepts used in WAC ([[Deliverable_References#WAC|WAC]]) and apply them to a distributed environment.

The most significant feature is the _[[Deliverable_Specifications_Security_Policies|security policy architecture]]_, which primarily controls applications’ access to device features, but also states rules about inter-device communication and event handling. The policy architecture also controls the storage and use of context data and is the main way in which user privacy can be protected. Policies are written in XACML and enforced at the Policy Enforcement Point, a key component in the personal zone proxy and personal zone hub. Policies are synchronised between user devices either via the personal zone hub or peer-to-peer, an important capability when two devices communicate for the first time and need to share credentials.

Policies are generated when an application is first installed and initially requests permission for accessing local resources. Permissions are defined in XML and included in the manifest file, as proposed in the _[[Deliverable_Specifications_API_Groups|device permissions]]_ section. The user is prompted to authorise the permissions using GUIs discussed in the _[[Deliverable_Specifications_Authorisation|runtime authorisation]]_ section, and is able to selectively grant and deny them. All permissions contain details of the privacy policies the application will follow. The user may also have their own, separate privacy policy defined on the platform (see _[[Deliverable_Specifications_Privacy_Policies|the privacy policy architecture]]_ section). If the user’s policy is in conflict with an application’s, they will be warned at install time or first use. Applications will also be installed only if they contain valid, comprehensive certificates from their author, as defined in the section on _[[Deliverable_Specifications_Application_Certification|application certificates]]_.

When interacting with webinos applications, users will need to authenticate both to the personal zone (to enable cross-device interaction) and potentially with the applications themselves. Webinos enables this through the [[Deliverable_Specifications_Authentication_Identity|authentication architecture]] which is detailed in deliverable D3.1. It reduces the need for users to have and remember passwords, a significant security benefit, by creating a webinos single sign-on system. Security for the sessions established in single sign-on and elsewhere are discussed in the section on _[[Deliverable_Specifications_Session_Security|session security]]_.

To support other parts of the platform, webinos will also provide [[Deliverable_Specifications_Secure_Storage|secure storage]] for data such as credentials, policies and personal information. [[Deliverable_Specifications_Extension_Handling|Extensions]] and _[[Deliverable_Specifications_Privileged_Apps|privileged applications]]_ - application given access to lower level runtime features - have also been considered, and have various security controls and restrictions applied to them. In addition, the runtime will support mechanisms to protect and report its integrity, as defined in the _[[Deliverable_Specifications_Platform_Integrity|platform integrity section]]_, so that remote relying parties can be sure that only trusted versions of the webinos runtime and applications are being used. This section also discussed the various threats from malware to the platform and how the implementation might protect itself from compromise.

Finally, issues involving the [[Deliverable_Specifications_Personal_Zone_Security|administration of the personal zone]] are part of the security architecture. These include how a zone is initially instantiated, how devices join and are revoked, how a personal zone hub is installed, and how users can change zones later on.
