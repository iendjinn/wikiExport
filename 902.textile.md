Currently we have demos of ServiceDiscovery API, Sensor API and Event API (but not consistent with the specified API). It was stated that API stubs and demos will probably not included in the delivery. ANy other views?

Other business
--------------

-   Wrapper API specifications â€“ status?

Claes to check with Daniel

-   How is the final â€œprintableâ€ delivery document generated? Any issues?

Not clear yet. Might be needed to add commands to indicate whetehr linked content should be included in the generated package or if it should just be a link.

-   API instantiation

Stefano/ISMB stated that each API must define that it is accessible through the Webinos object. This is missing in all API specifications except the Events module. See "Webinos events":http://dev.webinos.org/specifications/draft/events.html#::events::WebinosEvents.

-   Claes on vacation next week

- Christian acting WP3.2 leader.
- No WP3.2 call next Thursday. Instead WP3.2 issues are handled at the WP3 meeting on Wednesday the 22nd.
