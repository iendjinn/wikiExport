  _.Term   _.Definition
  CA            Certificate Authority. An infrastructure that issues certificates signed by or chained to a root certificate owned by the organization operating the CA infrastructure. CA-operating organizations typically own multiple root certificates, and apply various certification practices, e.g. level of business or domain validation required for issuing certificates signed by a particular root certificate.

  CRL           Certificate Revocation List. "A CRL is a time stamped list identifying revoked certificates which is signed by a CA or CRL issuer and made freely available in a public repository". [Source: "RFC 3280":http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3280.txt]
  SHCBK         Symmetrised Hash Commitment Before Knowledge (SHCBK) protocol. This protocol is designed to bootstrap security between a group of people in the absence of a public key infrastructure. It allows people to establish a secure, authenticated channel through comparing a short digest. More details can be found on the paper "Authentication protocols based on low-bandwidth unspoofable channels: a comparative survey":http://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/files/2857/Compara.pdf by Long Nguyen and Bill Roscoe.

Certificate hierarchy overview
------------------------------

The personal zone hub (PZH) is the certificate authority for a personal zone. The PZH issues a certificate for itself as well as certificates for all proxies in the zone. In particular for the PZH "master" CA certificates and associated public/private keys are created, as well as a _PZH TLS server/client certificate_, (the PZH, in "X509 terminology":http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5280#section-4.2.1.12, may act both as client and server). The latter and the certificates for the proxies in the zone are used to create mutually-authenticated TLS sessions. The PZH also has a web interface which uses a separate certificate. The CA certificate is self-signed by the service provider who owns the infrastructure the PZH is running on. If a user has a reliable home internet connection, then the PZH can optionally be hosted by a home router or server. In this case, either the CA certificate would be self-signed or signed by the manufacturer.

Each PZP also has a master CA certificate which it uses to create several other keys. This certificate is signed by the PZH when the PZP is enrolled. The CA key then issues a TLS client key for the PZP to create connections to the PZH, as well as encryption keys and keys for the widget renderer to communicate with the PZP.

### PZH keys and certificates

The PZH will have multiple CA certificates and keys. Each CA certificate may correspond to an OpenID identity. E.g., Alice Smith who is hosting her PZH at hubprovider.com might have the following PZH CA certificates:

  ----------------- ---------- ------------------------------------- --------------------------------
  OpenID            Key        Certificate common name               Certificate email address
  alice@foo.com     CA Key 1   Pzh:hubprovider.com:alice@foo.com     alice@foo.com
  a.smith@bar.com   CA Key 2   Pzh:hubprovider.com:a.smith@bar.com   a.smith@bar.com
  [none]            CA Key 3   Pzh:hubprovider.com:[random string]   [randomstring]@hubprovider.com
  ----------------- ---------- ------------------------------------- --------------------------------

The PZH will have other several keys and certificates, in the following categories:

  ------------------ --------------------------------------------------- ---------------------------------- -- ------------------ --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ------------------------------------------------------------ -- ---------------- ---------------------------- ------------------------------------------------------------
  Key                Use                                                 Certificate
  TLS (client) key   Client key for outgoing connections to other PZHs   Signed by one of the PZH CA keys
  CRL key            Signing CRLs for the revocation of PZPs             Signed by one of the PZH CA keys
  ------------------ --------------------------------------------------- ---------------------------------- -- ------------------ --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ------------------------------------------------------------ -- ---------------- ---------------------------- ------------------------------------------------------------

Every key with a certificate issued by a PZH CA must be duplicated for each CA key that exists.

### PZP keys and certificates

Each PZP will have the following keys and certificates:

  ------------------------ ------------------------------------------------------------------- -------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Key                      Use                                                                 Certificate
  PZP CA key               Creating certificates for other keys. Root identity for this key.   Signed by one of the PZH CA keys. Common name = Pzp:[user id]:[pzpname]
  PZP TLS client key       Client key for connecting to the PZH and other PZPs                 Signed by one of the PZP CA keys (any, default: first)
  PZP encryption key       Key that may be used to decrypt incoming data                       Signed by one of the PZP CA keys (any, default: first)
  PZP WebSocket key        Key used as a server to the WebSocket connection from the browser   Signed by one of the PZP CA keys (any, default: first)
  PZP Browser client key   Key used to identify the browser to the WebSocket connection.       Signed by one of the PZP CA keys (any, default: first)
  ------------------------ ------------------------------------------------------------------- -------------------------------------------------------------------------

For each PZH CA key and certificate, there ought to be a new PZP CA _certificate_ at the very least. It can be argued that there would need to be multiple keys, too.

For true unlinkability each PZP key certificate ought to be replicated for each PZH CA certificate and user identity. However, these are only used when either (a) connecting to the PZH, where pseudonymity and unlinkability are not important, or (b) when connecting to another PZP locally, peer-to-peer. We make the assumption that local peer-to-peer connections do not have the same pseudonymity and unlinkability requirements in the general case. This aspect of the specification can be changed if this is found to not be the case.

### Example 1: a personal zone with one user identity and two PZPs

Certificate exchange
--------------------

PZH CA certificates must be exchanged when two devices in different personal zones communicate for the first time. The following two scenarios describe how certificate exchange occurs when users are in proximity (e.g. connecting over the same WiFi) or when users are connecting remotely over the internet.

### Peer-to-peer

Exchanging certificates between two users who are in physical proximity is the device pairing problem. We intend to do the same using the SHCBK key agreement protocol (see "here":http://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/bill.roscoe/publications/120.pdf ) with either a _word-matching and number-typing_ or _repeated numeric comparison_ scheme for code comparison (see "this":http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2175905 for more detail).

Details of the implementation of this certificate exchange protocol can be found in the links above. The following diagram shows how it fits into the peer-to-peer connection scenario:

![]({width:1000px}pzp-localpeers.png)
("bigger":http://dev.webinos.org/redmine/attachments/download/2503)

### PZP to PZH

We imagine a scenario where Alice wants to access one of Bob’s device APIs over the internet, but neither of them have connected to each other before. We assume that Alice and Bob know each other’s email or social network identity, but are not in physical proximity.

Certificate exchange differs from enrolment in that PZHs are always peers of each other, and the performing certificate exchange does not imply a trusted relationship. Successful exchange of certificates _does_ imply that each PZH trusts that the other belongs to the person that they expect. For instance, Alice and Bob’s PZHs exchanging certificates only implies that Alice believes she has the correct PZH certificate for Bob and that Bob believes he has the correct certificate for Alice. No policy settings are changed nor information given away - the PZHs are not granted any additional access to each other’s personal zones.

There are several ways that webinos certificate exchange can be implemented, all of which provide guarantees that mutual authentication is achieved.

#### Certificate exchange through OpenId authentication

1.  The first step is discovery. Alice either already knows Bob’s personal zone hub URL (he may have shared it through email or his address book entry) or she uses an identifier for Bob (such as his email address) to discover it.
2.  Alice visits Bob’s PZH URL (pzh.example.com/bob/request-access ) and requests access to his resources.
3.  This prompts Alice to ‘log in’ via OpenID. Bob’s PZH therefore gains verified knowledge of Alice’s email address.
4.  Bob’s PZH redirects to Alice’s PZH ( pzh.webinos.org/alice/send-details ) sending Bob’s details to it, along with a short token.
5.  Alice’s PZH sends a signed request to Bob’s PZH containing her CA certificate and the token from Bob. Bob’s certificate is automatically added to her zone’s list of known users.
6.  Bob’s PZH checks the token and then prompts Bob that Alice (with a certain email address) wants to access his personal zone. Bob then decides whether he knows and trusts Alice or not.

Because Alice had discovered Bob based on an already-known identity or URL, we assume that no further identity assertion from Bob is required.

Tokens are not re-used and this process only occurs when two users communicate for the first time, peer-to-peer and online certificate exchange is not possible.

A state chart for this process can be found below:

![]({width:1200px}pzh-cert-exchange.png)
("bigger":http://dev.webinos.org/redmine/attachments/download/2505)

#### Certificate exchange over email

1.  Alice types Bob’s email address into her PZH.
2.  Alice’s PZH discovers Bob’s PZH address and downloads his certificate, adding it to her store of ‘known users’
3.  Alice’s PZH sends Bob an email from Alice’s email account (or the PZH provider’s email account) containing a link to Alice’s PZH and telling Bob that she would like to access his resources
4.  Bob clicks on the link
5.  This goes to Alice’s PZH which redirects to **Bob’s** PZH, complete with her CA certificate and PZH details
6.  Bob approves the addition of these details to the list of ‘known users’ in his personal zone.

This method relies upon the security of the email addresses used, and the authenticity of email headers, neither of which can necessarily be guaranteed. As such, this method should only be used in circumstances where both of these factors do hold, such as when PZH providers are well known authorities and also issue email addresses for users.

Key Storage Interface
---------------------

Confidential key storage is a required feature of any OS running a webinos PZP. More details about the specific implementations of key storage can be found in the [[PZP Deployment]] informative specification documents.

All private keys described above that are held by a PZP must be stored in a secure key storage facility. Such a facility must make sure that the key is accessible only to the PZP and not any other application. The best implementation of key storage would also protect the key from being copied off the hard drive, and might even be implemented using secure hardware such as a Trusted Platform Module or secure element. The key storage facility MAY require users to enter a password or have logged in using their normal account credentials. However, this is left as an option depending on platform.

The following code example shows the interface that has been implemented in webinos for storing and retrieving keys.

<pre>
<code class="javascript">
 ks.put(secretKey,secret);
 var secret = ks.get(secretKey);
 ks.delete(secretKey)
</code>
</pre>

Key backup and recovery
-----------------------

The personal zone system does not require an explicit recovery system. The OpenID provider will manage loss of passwords or user credentials. For PZPs, in the instance that a key is compromised or lost the device can be revoked and then re-added.
