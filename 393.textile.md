Widget handling
===============

Widgets handling covers the description, packaging and handling of the widgets as
well as the handling and presentation (start, stop, install, remove, update) on the device itself.

Widget packing
--------------

For packaging widgets, the "W3C Widgets":http://www.w3.org/TR/widgets/ seem to cover most of the webinos requirements.
While some propriatary extension (permitted and possible with W3C widgets) might be needed to cover all webinos
needs (for example, in addition to information about the widget author, some it may be required to add information
about the distributor to the widgets; analytics might have a different ‘destination’ than the author’s e-mail address;
an additional ‘human readable’ as well as a ‘processable’ version might be required, the need to specify what data
is specific to a widget (and needs to be removed on de-installation) and what data has been created for other
purposes and should remain after deinstallation…), the effort of adapting
W3C widgets to webinos requirements should be small.

Widget handling by webinos runtime
==================================

The widget handling part of the webinos runtime is concerned with handling the processing of widgets throughout the widget lifecycle.
The closest specification in regard to this area is the "WAC Widget Runtime":http://public.wholesaleappcommunity.com/redmine/embedded/wac2pubrev/core/widget-lifecycle.html

The overlap with webinos requirements is large, but webinos also needs to cover additional areas like the exchange of widgets between devices, the creation (and signing) of widgets on devices (to be consumer by other devices), the automatic start
of widgets based on external events, the handling of widgets running in the background and support for multitasking (such as assignment of priorities to widgets). The effort to extend the WAC specification for webinos needs seems mid-sized.
It needs to be checked whether webinos specifications can built upon WAC specifications or whether any copyright issues are involved.
