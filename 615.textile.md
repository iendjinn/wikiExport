=================================================

PZH = Personal Zone Hub: combines the functionality of **registrar** and **Identity Provider** (**IDP**) for the purpose of communicating among own devices in the own personal zone and across personal zones of other users
PZP = Personal Zone Proxy: a proxy of the PZH in the case the PZH cannot be accessed
