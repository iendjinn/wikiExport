Requirements and Specification Process
======================================

A proposal by Oxford for Task 3.3

[[Requirements Spec Process Example|Example]]

Overview
--------

In phase 1 of the project we produced requirements, which were then later improved and updated as part of T2.5. These can be found "here":http://dev.webinos.org/redmine/projects/wp2-5/wiki/Requirements . The requirements represent what we, at a fairly high level, want the platform to do (and how it should do it). They are what the system (as described by its architectural specification) should satisfy.

In addition, we have _code_ as produced by WP4 over the first phase of the project. This is now in a live repository and is modified through issues listed on the "Jira system":http://jira.webinos.org/secure/Dashboard.jspa .

**This proposals outlines how we can take advantage of the requirements to inform the specification, and how this will then lead to inputs for the Jira system and directly to implementation.**

We also have a "Roadmap document":http://dev.webinos.org/redmine/projects/wp4/wiki/Platform_Feature_Roadmap . This contains a mixture of goals and plans proposed by various partners for the second phase of development. _These need to be integrated with the requirements before they inform the architecture, but we expect that this will happen sometime soon_

Why does this need a process? Can’t we just add the requirements to Jira and do some documentation for the specification?
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The requirements we developed are at a high level, and most are currently not immediately implementable. Indeed, they leave many unanswered questions about the architecture and how webinos will work. This is absolutely fine and should be expected. However, as a result they are too ambiguous to be used directly and must be refined further for the specification of webinos.

The refinement of requirements into specification involves thinking carefully about each component in the system (which we already have a rough idea about from the initial specification and implementation) and precisely how it will satisfy its goals and what it needs to do. It is also important to capture this process and document _why_ decisions were taken, so that someone reading the specification can understand the thinking behind it. This can be done by referencing each component (and its specification) to the requirements (old or new) they are satisfying.

This proposal will outline how we can document the right information and maintain a level of traceability to our requirements.

Step 1: choose an architectural component
-----------------------------------------

The first step of the process is choosing a component (or small set of components) to specify. The following table contains some examples:

  --------------------- -- --------------------
  Policy manager
  Certificate manager
  PZH web interface
  Discovery system
  Context database
  Events module
  AppLauncher
  Web Runtime
  NFC module
  Payment API
  TV API
  KeyStore
  Messaging
  Synchronisation
  File API
  Gallery API
  Widget Manager
  Contacts Module
  --------------------- -- --------------------

These are just examples. There will be others, and you may decide to break some of them down further.

Good inputs to this process are the specifications from phase 1, the requirements and the code repository.

Step 2: Draw a component and connector (C&C) diagram
----------------------------------------------------

The next step is to draw a diagram of how the component interacts with other parts of the system. This is supposed to help expose issues which may not have been identified before. It should be a thought-provoking task, and should raise lots of questions.

We propose using a UML Component and Connector diagram for each component. These diagrams show the **required** and **provided** interfaces of each component.

### Making the diagrams

There are lots of tools you can use to make these diagrams. This might be done best by pen and paper, or with something like Visio. Don’t rely too much on tools - they are rarely totally compliant with what you want to do. The important parts of a C&C diagram are the components (boxes) and the required and provided interfaces.

**Note**: in some cases, a C&C diagram is not appropriate, or may need additional documentation in another way. For instance, protocols are best written in text, and some components may need sequence or object diagrams to show how they behave.

Step 3: Create refined system specifications through goal trees
---------------------------------------------------------------

The next step is to express what each component is trying to do - its goals and requirements. These will be refined into _system specifications_ which are suitably fine-grained requirements capable of specifying behaviour in enough detail to be useful for implementers.

There are many sources of requirements -

-   Some of these would come from the requirements in "T2.5":http://dev.webinos.org/redmine/projects/wp2-5/wiki/Requirements .
-   Some will be a refinement of the original requirements - a more detailed breakdown of a high-level goal.
-   Some, however, will be completely new requirements derived by looking at the architecture. E.g. "The policy manager will check policies against an XML Schema" might be a new sub-requirement.

The best way of documenting the requirements and specifications is through a goal tree. The following example illustrates this:

{{graphviz(
digraph G {
 rankdir=BT;
 size="11,11"

// Goals
 TOPLEVEL[shape = rectangle, label = "Top level requirement n Taken from T2.5 - Link "];
 MIDLEVEL1[shape = rectangle, label = "refined requirement"];
 MIDLEVEL2[shape = rectangle, label = "refined requirement"];
 LOWLEVEL1[shape = rectangle, label = "system specification: specific requirement n for this part of the component"];
 LOWLEVEL2[shape = rectangle, label = "system specification: specific requirement n for this part of the component"];
 LOWLEVEL3[shape = rectangle, label = "system specification: specific requirement n for this part of the component"];

MIDLEVEL1 -> TOPLEVEL;
 MIDLEVEL2 -> TOPLEVEL;
 LOWLEVEL1 -> MIDLEVEL1;
 LOWLEVEL2 -> MIDLEVEL1;
 LOWLEVEL3 -> MIDLEVEL2;
 }

</div>
Step 4: Add a fit criteria to the leaf nodes of the tree
--------------------------------------------------------

Each of the _system specifications_ - the leaf nodes of the goal tree created in the previous step should have a fit criteria. This is a test which can be applied to the component to see whether the specification is being followed by the implementation. For example, a fit criterion for the requirement "The policy manager will check policies against an XML Schema" might be along the lines of "An XML policy file which is not well formed or has the wrong structure shall produce an error when the policy manager attempts to load it".

Step 5: Add system specifications to Jira
-----------------------------------------

The system specifications created in the previous step should be (more-or-less) directly implementable. This means that they can be created as Jira issues or features and added to backlogs.

There probably ought to be some review of each specification item, but this is out of scope of this proposal.

It is of course unnecessary for those items which have already been implemented, although in these cases, a testcase could be added as a Jira task.
