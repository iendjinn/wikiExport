Protocol definitions
====================

This section provides outline specifications for device and service discovery module. Device discovery aspect is not limited to just one protocol but provides support for discovery on more than one interface and allows usage of more than one discovery mechanism.

Discovery module aims to provide wrapper interface for high level API and low level discovery specific API. It will provide a uniform interface for web developers to obtain addressing information on devices and services across a wide range of interconnecting technologies. The discovery module shall provide the following functionalities:

1.  Advertise or publish device/serviceâ€™s availability and capability
2.  Query or find device/service based on certain criteria
3.  Bind with device/services that meets the searching requirement

To describe above functionalities below section covers data structure and functional methods for discovery mechanism. All aspects covered below differ for local and remote discovery mechanism.

*Note: Webinos will provide information about interfaces based on BT and WLAN. Discovering WiFi/BT devices and connecting to such devices is outside scope of webinos and is underlying OS functionality. Assigning IP address after connection establishment is also underlying OS functionality. Though webinos can provide these functionalities but it will be replication of service.*

Advertising/Publishing Information
----------------------------------

In this functionality device advertise their services and allow other devices to discover device’s service. Each discovery mechanism has different way of advertising services and allow communication establishment with the device. Mechanism of advertising differs in local discovery and remote discovery.

In local discovery mechanism, service availability/publishing has to be multicast and discovery happens by looking for a service and establishing communication with the device based on the service details. In remote discovery, connection is established with personal hub first and then information is exchanged to discover new devices.

### Local Discovery

The interface that will be provided to search local device in webinos will be USB. WiFi and BT device discovery as mentioned above will be discovered and connected through underlying OS. Support to retrieve information about connection to such interfaces will be supported. Both BT and WiFi devices do not require being addressable.

Reason for including USB is to find all devices that are connected to a device to be searchable and allow remote device to connect to the device, for usage through USB over IP.

All interfaces are to be handled as resource and should be separately addressable for remote device to discover it.

Device needs to advertise about the service it offers using ZeroConf or UPnP. This advertisement provides information about capabilities of the device and the information to establish communication with the device.

<pre><code class="c">
#define MAC_LEN 6

// Discovery structure searches for device based on interface and discovery mechanism
// Note it is not needed to use all mechanism all the time, it is user configurable option.
struct discovery{

// List of USB connected interfaces
 USB *usb;

// Holds list of printers found through SLP
 SLP *slp;

// Devices published/advertised information as well as device found through ZeroConf resolve method
 ZeroConf *zero_conf;

// UPnP device discovered list
 UPNP *upnp;

// DLNA discovered device list
 DLNA *dlna;
};

// UPNP based devices found are hold in this structure
typedef struct _UPNP{

// Unique id of the device
 char *uuid;

// Device type along with manufacturer details
 char *device_type;

// Address of device
 char *address;

// Port on which service is available
 int port;

// Description of service
 char *description;

// Holds another UPnP discovered device
 struct _UPNP *next;
}UPNP;

// Discover printers based on SLP
typedef struct _SLP{

// Service type
 char *srvtype;

// Service URL
 char *srvurl;

// TO hold other SLP discovered devices
 struct _SLP *next;
}SLP;

// Structure to hold ZeroConf information
typedef struct _ZeroConf{

// Publish device details, this is first step to be done since devices need to start service before publishing service
 ZeroConf_Publish *publish;

// Discovered ZeroConf based device details
 ZeroConf_Resolve *resolve;
}ZeroConf;

// This structure holds information that will be used for publishing service for webinos based device
typedef struct _ZeroConf_Publish{

// Name of the device such as hostname@machinename
 char *name;

// Port on which service will be available
 int port;

// Advertised service type such as _presence._tcp
 char **service_type;

 // TXT in form of pair (type=value)
 char***txt;
}ZeroConf_Publish;

// This structure holds information of ZeroConf device available in the network
typedef struct _ZeroConf_Resolve{

// user assigned name or default name
 char *name;

// service name of the type we are connecting to
 char *type;

// human friendly service description
 char *nice;

// numeric network interface index
 char *iface;

// true => IPv6, false => IPv4
 bool ipv6;

// IP address
 char *address;

// Port on which service is running
 int port;

// additional name/value pairs
 char *txt;

// Holds next ZeroConf Resolve data;
 struct _ZeroConf_Resolve *next;

}ZeroConf_Resolve;

// This struct will hold information about searched USB devices
typedef struct _USB{
 // Unique product number of USB device
 unsigned long product_number;

// Vendor/Manufacturer id
 unsigned long vendor_id;

//USB standard defined class of device
 unsigned long device_class;

// Each device class is divided into multiple device sub class
 unsigned long device_sub_class;

// Device number
 unsigned long device_num;

// Bus on which device is running
 unsigned long bus_num;

// Text description of the vendor name
 char *vendor_name;

// Hold details of next USB device
 struct _USB *next;
}USB;

</code></pre>

Devices searched are presented to the user and once user selects device to connect with, a bind operation is performed on the device.

Bind
----

Bind based on whether user wants to find device locally or find remote device through personal hub.

### Local Device Bind

Each interface defines different bind mechanism. If binding is based on interface, device will be connected to selected interface. In typical socket communication it would be based getting information based on getaddrinfo. Once information is retrieved, a socket connection is established.

<pre><code class="c">
struct device_bind
{
 // protocol type
 unsigned char protocol;

// interface
 unsigned char iface;

// host name of the device
 char *hostname;

// IPv6 address
 unsigned char ipv6[16];

// IPv4 address
 unsigned char ipv4[14];

// port number to connect or the port that will be used if acting as server. This could be user input or random input
 int port;

// MAC addr of the interface, if USB product:vendorid, rest filled with Zero
 char mac_addr[MAC_LEN];
}LocalConn;

// 1 if successful or if any error depends on iface and socket error

int connect_local(LocalConn *local);
</code></pre>

### Remote Discovery

There are several mechanisms that supports remote discovery. To communicate with remote device, it requires having IP address or domain information to establish socket communication with the device. First step is to gather addressing information.

There are several mechanisms to perform remote discovery of devices, it can be done through resource distributed as distributed hash tables or use XMPP based discovery.

The reason for considering XMPP as a remote discovery mechanism is it allows connection with same id but connection is possible with different resources. For example provided this a connection can be established over XMPP: alice@example.org/camera. In this alice is a userid, example.org is the domain that holds information about user alice and camera is the resource that wants to connect. It allows fetching information about user friend list and resources online. Communication is over TLS (Transport Layer Security) and SASL is used for authentication with minimum of Digest-MD5 cryptographic mechanism. It provides several security mechanisms such as end to end secure channel establishment and secure sessions. It supports serverless messaging which works without XMPP server and is based on ZeroConf. XMPP also support service discovery, which is negotiated during connect establish process. Though webinos specification is not restricted to XMPP, it is presented in order to implement phase 1

Remote discovery happens through personal hub. The personal hub will provide a domain name and then DNS-SRV resolution takes place to fetch address information and then socket communication is done to the fetched address information. The information needed from user is userid along with domain name, resource, and password. Based on this information connection will be established with personal hub. User can discover other users and their devices and establish communication with the resources.

<pre><code class="c">
typedef struct remote_conn{

// This will hold username in case of connection to XMPP server and nick in case of connecting to XMPP
 // serverless messaging
 char **username_nick;

 // Domain name where user is registered with and in XMPP serverless as a machine name
 char** domain_machinename;

// Password required for connecting with XMPP server
 char* password;

// If same resource is to be used with multiple resources, all resource information. This could be user input
 // or information is filled in automatically based on discoverable device configuration
 char **resources;
}RemoteConn;

// Error handling based on XMPP error message
// This call has to be called in order to establish communication with remote XMPP server and in case of Serverless
// Messaging this will be used to start services locally, advertise service, and connect to remote device.

int connect (RemoteConn *remote);
</code></pre>

Query Information
-----------------

The data structures defined support interfaces and devices. Each interface and discovery mechanism can be queried to get device specific information. Results might vary depending on device and mechanism used to find the device, for example USB discovery mechanism provides different information and if queried for device found through UPnP or ZeroConf information provides is different.

<pre><code class="c">
// Returns 1 if it meets filter option or else result will be based on interface results
// result will be based on format that developer can understand
int query (char *device_interface, char *filter_option, char **result);

// Returns the IP address depending on the interface
char** getIPAddress(char *iface);
</code></pre>

(Q) Do we need to define structure for each device, what parameters and factors should we consider representing in these structures?
