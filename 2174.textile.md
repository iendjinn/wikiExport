1. Introduction
---------------

The development and deployment of ubiquitous applications introduces an important series of resource-consuming requirements [Banavar and Bernstein 2004]. The available combinations of hardware characteristics, operating systems, software frameworks, etc. are virtually endless. For software developers, this diversity has turned out to be a double-barreled asset. It provides consumers the freedom to operate applications at will across several devices. On the other hand, the device diversity asset heavily fragments the application’s delivery targets. By the absence of a general native development solution, developers often have no alternative than to create and maintain a set of device-dependent versions of their applications. Hence, ensuring a viable balance between development costs and an application’s market coverage will more than ever become a challenging issue.

### 1.1 Separation of Concerns

To accommodate with the high-variability aspect, software systems are traditionally engineered along three orthogonal dimensions: the development phases, the system’s views, and its aspects [Schauerhuber et al. 2007]. This approach is characterized by the separation of concerns, as it embodies a well accepted technique to reduce the engineering complexity of a software system [Dijkstra 1976]. First of all, the phase dimension sets out the different stages of the Web development process, ranging from analysis, to design, and implementation. Each of these phases requires a number of specific views addressing the system’s content structures and application logic, the navigational structures between content nodes, and its presentation towards the user. Hence, the views dimension. Finally, the aspects dimension sets out the structural (objects, attributes, relationships) and behavioral aspects (functions, processes) of each of the above-mentioned views.

The growing presence and importance of mobile and ubiquitous applications emphasizes the need for fragmentation management within the Web engineering methodology. As identified by [Koch et al. 2008], context-aware adaptability can be considered as an additional Web engineering dimension, crosscutting all existing Web modeling dimensions. [Schauerhuber et al. 2007] as well as [Linaje et al. 2010] investigated the support for adaptability requirements within various Web engineering methods. A number of approaches were identified to incorporate partial Model Driven Architecture (MDA) compliance (e.g., UWE, WSDM, HERA, WebML, etc.). Through an MDA-based approach, software development is started with an abstract platform-independent model (PIM) specification of the system [Miller and Mukerji 2003]. A transformation model is in turn applied to compile the PIM to a platform-specific model (PSM). The transformation process is at the heart of MDA’s adaptability approach. For this purpose, MDA proposes the Query-View-Transformation standard (QVT) as a language for specifying model-to-model transformation rules [OMG 2011].

Nevertheless the potential flexibility of model driven approaches, the applicability of existing Web modeling methods for handling ubiquitous fragmentation remains rather limited. This observation can be explained through the complex composition of the design space. The aforementioned contextual aspects, both static and dynamic, influence a modeling method’s strength and expressiveness in terms of adaptability [Kappel et al. 2001]. In result, adaptability requirements ought to be handled throughout every stage of a system’s development life cycle. Especially from a ubiquitous software development perspective, the multi-dimensional impact of adaptability puts a heavy burden on the software engineering and development processes.

### 1.2 Context of Use

The availability of detailed and reliable metadata regarding a user’s contextual situation provides an important driver for enabling rich ubiquitous applications. The exact entities represented by this contextual information can be of a very dynamic nature, potentially affecting the consumer’s expectations towards the application’s user interface, behavior, content, etc. In initial context-aware research, context of use was considered a component containing only two parameters: the end-user’s location and the set of objects in the immediate vicinity [Schilit et al. 1994]. The subsequent introduction of extensible contextual categories has drastically increased the flexibility of this definition [Brown et al. 1997]. Chen and Kotz hereto identified five contextual base categories: the device context, the user context, the environment context, the time context, and the historical context [Chen and Kotz 2000].

The device context describes the characteristics of the target device that is being used to access the application. A ubiquitous ecosystem covers a diversity of screen sizes, interaction methods, software support, etc. In Web-based environments, the device capabilities are generally retrieved through Resource Description Framework (RDF) devices profiles, i.e., User Agent Profile (UAProf) [OMA 2001] and Composite Capability/Preference Profiles (CC/PP) [Kiss 2010]. The necessary device identification step in this process is handled through HTTP header user agent matching. In order to facilitate the collection and aggregation of these device profiles, the W3C Mobile Web Initiative (MWI) standardized the Device Description Repository specification (DDR). The specification provides an API and its associated vocabulary for structured access to context providers services [Rabin et al. 2008]. In essence, a DDR thus provides a standardized means for retrieving contextual information about a-priori knowledge on the characteristics of a particular target device or Web runtime. Various open as well as proprietary DDR implementations are actively being maintained. Most notably OpenDDR, WURFL, and DeviceAtlas.

In a ubiquitous setting, the end-user’s profile description gains more and more importance. Besides exposing information on user preferences and specific experience, this model should also comprise knowledge regarding the user’s specific abilities and disabilities. E.g., enabling accessibility requirements for providing support to elderly people, and people with disabilities. From this perspective, Heckmann proposed the GUMO formalism as a general user model ontology for representing generic user descriptions using the Web Ontology Language semantics (OWL) [Heckmann 2005]. The current challenge in this domain is modeling the enormous amount of parameters and relationships that characterize the user context [Silva et al. 2011]. To overcome this issue, forces are being joined with other ontology-driven projects such as Linked Data [Heath and Bizer 2011], and UbisWorld [Heckmann et al. 2009].

The environment-, time-, and historical context aspects define where, how, and when the interaction between the user and an application is exactly taking place. The environment context is specified by observing the numerous sensors available on the user’s device (e.g., location, temperatures, network service discovery, the level of background noise, etc.). Furthermore, the notion of time and historical context is not to be neglected. As context is a dynamic concept, support for temporal patterns recognition and management is needed. The W3C Ubiquitous Web Domain is currently in the process of standardizing the Delivery Context Ontology specification (DCO) [Cantera and Rhys 2010]. The DCO provides a formal model of the characteristics of the environment in which devices, applications, and services are operating.

2. Model-based User Interfaces
------------------------------

Recent research on model driven engineering has been particularly active in the domain of user interface engineering. The CAMELEON Reference Framework (CRF) defines an important foundation for this type of approaches [Calvary et al. 2003]. The framework specifies a context-sensitive user interface development process, driven by an intrinsic notion of the current user context, the environment context, as well as the platform context. According to the CRF approach, an application’s user interface development consists of multiple levels of abstraction. Starting from an abstract representation of the interface’s task and domain model, a PSM of the user interface is subsequently generated by means of a chained model transformations based on contextual knowledge. A number of languages have adopted CRF: UsiXML [Limbourg et al. 2004], useML [Meixner and Thiels 2008], and MARIA [Paterno et al. 2009]. Moreover, the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) charted the Model-Based UI Working Group (MBUI-WG) as part of its Ubiquitous Web Activity (UWA) to investigate the standardization of context-aware user interface authoring [Cantera 2010]. Its goal is to work on standards that enable the authoring of context-aware user interfaces for web applications. The MBUI-WG aims to achieve this type of adaptivity by means of a model driven design approach. In this context, the semantically structured aspects of HTML5 will be used as key delivery platform for the applications’ adaptive user interface.

### 2.1 Abstraction Levels and Transformations

The CAMELEON Reference Framework relies on a model driven approach and structures the development of a user interface into four subsequent levels of abstration:

-   Specification of the **task and domain model**, defining a user’s required activities in order to reach his goals.
-   Definition of an **abstract user interface (AUI) model**. The AUI model defines a platform-independent model (PIM), which expresses the application’s interface independently from any interactors or modalities within the delivery context’s attributes.
-   Definition of a **concrete user interface (CUI) model**, a platform-specific model (PSM) which generates a more concrete description of the AUI by including specific dependencies and interactor types based on the delivery context.
-   Specification of the **final user interface (FUI)**, covering the code that corresponds with the user interface in its runtime environment (e.g., HTML, Java, etc.).

Figure 2 shows the interconnections and transformations between the above-mentioned CRF stages. The downward arrows depict reification processes. Reification is the transformation from a higher-level abstraction to a lower-level abstraction phase, hence inferring a more concrete UI description. The upward arrows, on the other hand, specify the abstraction processes. An abstraction is the inverse transformation of reification. The third transformation type is the translation, depicted by the horizontal arrows. The translation deals with adapting the UI description to changes in one of the context of use models. In this case, the UI description’s abstraction level remains the same when performing a translation.

### 2.2 Adaptation Granularity and Approaches

The expected adaptability granularity has a major impact on a user interface’s engineering complexity. This property, e.g., indicates whether the defined adaptation process affects the entire UI, or only a contained number of identifiable sub-views. The Context-Aware Design Space (CADS), proposed by Vanderdonckt et al., can be utilized as a means to analyze and compare a software system’s dimensions subject to adaptation [Vanderdonckt et al. 2008]. As shown in Figure 3, the design space defines by default seven adaptation dimensions, but it can be extended with additional dimensions based on the application domain’s specific needs.

-   **Adaptation means:** denotes to which degree the adaptation should reconfigure the UI by inserting/deleting/modifying components, and whether it should also result in the re-allocation of UI components to different physical devices.
-   **UI Component granularity:** defines the smallest UI component unit that should be subjected to adaptation.
-   **State recovery:** characterizes the extent to which the state of performed adaptations can be transferred or recovered. This dimension ranges from transferring adaptation at the session level, to picking up the current task at the exact point in which it was stopped by enabling the recovery of individual actions.
-   **UI deployment:** defines whether decision regarding the deployment and adaptation of UI components is statically defined, or based on a more dynamic at-runtime model.
-   **Context coverage:** determines the UI’s expected degree of context awareness. This dimension denotes the UI’s adaptability in terms of the user’s specific characteristics, his device(s), and a description of their physical environment.
-   **Technological spaces:** documents the technological diversity that needs to be covered by the UI. This dimension defines whether the UI needs to cover one or more technoligical spaces (e.g., HTML, Qt, Tcl, AWT, Swing, etc.) and in case of a distributed UI, whether the allocated components cover different spaces.
-   **Meta-UI usage:** documents the existence of a meta-UI that enables control over the actual UI’s adaptation.

As documented by Schaefer, various approaches can be used to express the adaptation of a model-based user interface [Schaefer 2007]. In essence, three types of adaptation approaches can be distinguished: model-to-model transformations, transformations on the XML representation of models, and code transformations. The model-to-model approach relies on the fact that most MBUI models can be designed based on a directed graph structure. In result, adaptations between two models are specified with model mappings by means of graph transformation rules. As depicted in Figure 4, transformation rules consist of a Left Hand Side (LHS) condition matching the current UI model represented by graph G [Limbourgh et al. 2005]. To add expressiveness, one or more Negative Application Condition (NAC), which should not match G, can be defined. Based on the matching of these conditions a Right Hand Side (RHS) defines the transformation result by replacing LHS occurrence in G with RHS. This substitution operation results in an adapted UI model represented by graph G’.

Figure 4

Furthermore, for UI models represented with XML, XSLT transformations can be used as a more declarative way to define adaptations [Kay 2007]. The transformation process takes a XML based document as input together with an XSLT stylesheet module containing the transformation rules (see Figure 5). Each transformation rule consists of a matching pattern and an output template. Patterns to be matched in the input XML document are defined by a subset of the XPath language [Berglund et al. 2010]. The output after applying the appropriate transformations can be standard XML, but also other formats such as (X)HTML, XSL-FO, plain text, etc.
