Security for Extensions
-----------------------

### Introduction

Webinos extensions will be based on the NPAPI Standard; this raises several security risks which have to be reflected in the webinos security architecture. The architecture has to balance the security of the whole system on the one side and the flexibility of extensions on the other. An extension requires access to the underlying operating systems by definition, but breaks the natural sandbox of the browser runtime.

### Background

#### Requirements

The requirements for the extensions handling focus on the secure execution of applications (known behaviour of the application), the user awarness of the functionality and risks exposed by extentsions and the possibility of the user to control the access to extensions. These requirements apply to the some extend to the generic access of device resources.

This section of the specification aims to satisfy (partially) the following requirements:

-   "PS-USR-Oxford-17":http://dev.webinos.org/redmine/projects/wp2-2/wiki/DeliverableVersionAll#PS-USR-Oxford-17 : The webinos Runtime Environment shall be capable of setting dynamic access control policies for device data when initiating an association to another webinos Device.
-   "PS-USR-Oxford-106":http://dev.webinos.org/redmine/projects/wp2-2/wiki/DeliverableVersionAll#PS-USR-Oxford-106 : When installing or using an application for the first time, webinos shall make sure that the user trusts the source of the application.
-   "PS-USR-Oxford-116":http://dev.webinos.org/redmine/projects/wp2-2/wiki/DeliverableVersionAll#PS-USR-Oxford-116 : The webinos Runtime Environment shall protect applications and itself from potentially malicious applications and shall protect the device from being made unusable or damaged by applications.
-   "PS-DEV-ambiesense-25":http://dev.webinos.org/redmine/projects/wp2-2/wiki/DeliverableVersionAll#PS-DEV-ambiesense-25 : The webinos runtime shall protect policies from tampering or modification by unauthorised applications. The only authorised applications shall be from signed, trusted sources, which may be defined by the manufacturer, network provider, or end user.
-   "PS-DWP-ISMB-202":http://dev.webinos.org/redmine/projects/wp2-2/wiki/DeliverableVersionAll#PS-DWP-ISMB-202 : The webinos runtime must ensure that an application does not access device features, extensions and content other than those associated to it.
-   "PS-USR-Oxford-53":http://dev.webinos.org/redmine/projects/wp2-2/wiki/DeliverableVersionAll#PS-USR-Oxford-53 : webinos policies shall be capable of referring to and specifying restrictions on device capabilities and features, application data, context and personal information held in webinos, and access to other devices and applications.
-   "PS-USR_DEV-Oxford-44":http://dev.webinos.org/redmine/projects/wp2-2/wiki/DeliverableVersionAll#PS-USR_DEV-Oxford-44 : Applications shall specify at install time (or first use) the functionality they require access to.
-   "PS-USR_DEV-Oxford-45":http://dev.webinos.org/redmine/projects/wp2-2/wiki/DeliverableVersionAll#PS-USR_DEV-Oxford-45 : Users shall be able to specify at application install time (or first use) which functionality they permit an application to have access to.
-   "PS-USR_DEV-Oxford-46":http://dev.webinos.org/redmine/projects/wp2-2/wiki/DeliverableVersionAll#PS-USR_DEV-Oxford-46 : Applications shall request for access rights to any device feature or policy-controlled item prior to accessing it. If an access request is denied, applications shall be notified to deal with this gracefully.

#### Related technology and research

Browser vendors have integrated mechanisms to secure the usage of NPAPI plug-ins:

-   Chrome and Firefox are using a built-in generic NPAPI plug-in for identifying missing but required plug-ins. As a back-end infrastructure for this; Mozilla and Google maintain a repository for trusted NPAPI plug-ins ([[Deliverable_References#MozillaPluginDirectory|MozillaPluginDirectory]]). The generic plug-in queries the hosted directory for a trusted plug-in supporting the unknown MIME-Type, downloads the binary and stores the plug-in binary inside the common plug-in folder of the device to enable the usage by the browser.

-   For Chrome extensions embedding NPAPI plug-ins inside extension package, Google does not publish the extension on their Chrome app store until the extension has been tested against malicious behaviour of the NPAPI plug-in. ([[Deliverable_References#ChromeNpapiExtensions|ChromeNpapiExtensions]])

-   Furthermore, Google introduced the Native Client (NaCl) to enable the secure execution of native code inside the browser environment. But this concepts reduces the possible functionality of an extension significantly ([[Deliverable_References#GoogleNativeClient|GoogleNativeClient]]). The NaCl runtime prohibits all access to OS services (e.g. network or file system).

-   The Firefox add-on "NoScript" illustrates how the user can enable or disable specific plug-ins for certain origins (protocol, domain, port) depending on his choice. ([[Deliverable_References#NoScript|NoScript]])

#### Threats

NPAPIâ€™s unrestricted access to operating system - which is needed to enable extensions in webinos - introduces infinite security risks, such as:

-   Manipulation of the file system
-   Access to sensitive data
-   Uncontrollable network access

### Components

#### The application installer

For extensions that are part of the application package the application installer verifies the signature of the package and allows or disallows the installation of application including the plug-in accordingly. Furthermore the application installer informs the user of the potential security risks and enables the user to prohibit the installation of the plug-in (defining policy). After the integrity of the application has been verified and the user has approved the installation of the application, the installer extracts the platform relevant NPAPI binary from the application package and stores it inside the common plug-in folder of the browser.

#### The application launcher

The application launcher checks the application manifest and the policies files regarding the usage of the extension and enables the access to the plug-ins accordingly. The access to extensions is disabled by default.

#### Secure storage for certificates

The secure storage is used to store the relevant policies and certificates for the installation and execution of webinos extensions.

#### Application packaging: manifests and resources

Inside the manifest the embedded plug-ins are defined, see ([[Deliverable_References#Webinos-D31|Webinos-D31]]) for more details.

### Future directions

The current security concept focuses on the installation and execution of verified plug-ins. Once the plug-in is installed it has the unlimited the access to operating system and runs out of the control from the incorporated security mechanisms.

Depending on the success of extensions in webinos on NPAPI basis, it will be necessary to incorporate higher security measurements for extensions on the client side. Nowadays NPAPI plug-ins is usually executed in a separate OS process. When the browser spawns the new process the process rights could be restricted to the OS services (e.g. file access, network) required for the plug-in to be executed. _A similar approach is done for NaCl: on Windows all privileges for the NaCl process are limited._
