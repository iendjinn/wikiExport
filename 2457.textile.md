Data & Communication
====================

The UI adapatation works on an event-condition-action based approach. The rules are stored as a separate file. Application rules are stored inside the applications package. Each rule can contains an events, conditions and action section:
* The events part specifies the signal that triggers the invocation of the rule. The event is mapped to change in a property in the local Device Status Status and a type of the Sensor Service.
* The conditions part is a logical test that, if satisfied or evaluates to true, causes the action to be carried out. This part also references information from the Device Status Service and Senor Services.
* The action part consists the UI adaptations which are being transformed.

As there is a distinction between evented and unvevented rules, the conditions and events section is not always necessary. The following combinations are possible:
* n events + n conditions (evented): The action is only performed, when one of the events occurs and the conditions apply
* n events (evented): The action is performed, when one of the events occurs
* n conditions (unevented): The action is performed

The rules for the enabling the content adaptation are defined using XML notion.

Enabling the UI adaptation in the application manifest
------------------------------------------------------

Applications making use of the Adaptation Manager running on the PZP need to indicate this in the application manifest with the parameter `webinos:uiadaptation`, the allowed parameters are:

-   none: This is the default value. UI adaptation is not used in the application
-   custom: Application makes use of the Adpatatation Manager running on the PZP. The application package containe the file adapatationrules.xml
-   platformdefined: indicates that the application is making use of platform defined adaptation rules (see chapter: platform specified rules)

XML file containing the adaptation rules needs to have the name adaptationrules.xml and need to be part of the widget package.

### Example

<pre>
<code class="XML">
 <webinos:uiadaptation>none</webinos:uiadaptation>
</code>
</pre>

Rule definition
---------------

The following section outlines

### Events section

In the events section the triggers for a rule are defined. The events section can contain more than one event. Events are logically connected by an ‘or’. At least one event has to be defined for the rule to be valid.

#### Parameters

The type property indicates which device element is beeing monitored by the rule. The supported types are mapped to an property of the Device Status API [1] and to a sensor type in the generic sensor API. [2]

Value based conditions on these events should be put as conditions in the conditions tag.

#### Examples

The following example illustrates that the action should only be triggered when the light sensor changes

<pre>
<code class="xml">
<event>sensors.light</event>
<conditions>
 <condition>
 <type>sensors.light</type>
 <value>[0,60]</value>
 </condition>
</conditions>
</code>
</pre>

The following example illustrates that an action should only be triggered when the battery of a device is beeing charged.

<pre>
<code class="xml">
<event>battery. batteryBeingCharged</event>
<conditions>
 <condition>
 <type>battery. batteryBeingCharged</type>
 <value>true</value>
 </condition>
</conditions>
</code>
</pre>

### ConditionSet section

Conditions provide the means to restrict the the circumstances, when an action shall be performed. Conditions can be aggregated by using a ConditionSet.

Conditions are defined by the two attributes type and value.

ConditionSet can contain Conditions or ConditionSets and the aggregatortype is an attribute of the ConditionSet

#### Parameters

##### type

The type property indicates on which device element the condition is beeing applied. The supported types are mapped to an property of the Device Status API [1] and to a sensor type in the generic sensor API. [2]

##### value

In the value attribute it is defined, for what values the condition is valid or not.

The value can either be an interval or a specific value of the sensor type. Intervals are defined by providing the lower and upper limit of the interval with square brackets **,**. If one limit is missing, the interval is interpreted as greater or less.
For events type derived from the Device Status API the value is mapped to watchOptions.range. In case of a sensor type event the value is be matched to a sensorValue[0].

#### examples

The following example illustrate, that action should only beeing triggerd on in-car headunits.

<pre>
<code class="xml">
<condition>
 <type>device.type</type>
 <value>vehicle</value>
</condition>
</code>
</pre>

The following example illustrate, that action should only beeing triggerd on in-car headunits when the light is below a threshold of 60.

<pre>
<code class="xml">
<conditionSet aggregatorType="AND">
 <condition>
 <type>device.type</type>
 <value>vehicle</value>
 </condition>
 <condition>
 <type>sensors.light</type>
 <value>[,60[</value>
 </condition>
</conditionSet>
</code>
</pre>

### Actions section

The action section conatins the JavaScript, which is injected, when the Event is triggered and the conditions are valid.

### Comprehensive rule examples

#### Event-Condition-Action rule

The following example illustrates that an action is triggered, when the sensor value of the light sensor changes to 0 and 30 lux and the device type on which the application is running is an ivi system.

<pre>
<code class="xml">
<rule>
<events>
 <event>sensors.light </event>
</events>
<conditionSet aggregatorType="AND">
 <condition>
 <type>sensors.light</type>
 <value>[0,30]</value>
 </condition>
 <condition>
 <type>device.type</type>
 <value>ivi</value>
 </condition>
</conditionSet>

<action>
 //JavaScript code for switching the css style
</action>
</rule>
</code>
</pre>

#### Condition-Action rule

The following examples illustrates how a rule specifically for the vehicle environment can look like.

<pre>
<code class="xml">
<rule>
<events>
 <event>application.launch</event>
</events>
<conditionSet aggregatorType="AND">
 <condition>
 <type>device.type</type>
 <value>ivi</value>
 </condition>
</conditionSet>
<action>
 //JAVA script action
</action>
</rule>
</code>
</pre>
