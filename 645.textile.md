WP31 Event Handling
===================

Events are essentially structured messages and could be delivered reliably over TCP, or unreliably as unicast or multicast messages over UDP. To cope with devices that are switched off or currently inaccessible we also need to allow for store and forward distribution of events. Events may be passed across Firewalls and NAT boundaries, and via communication hubs. Events from different sources/services may be multiplexed on the same stream for better utilization of network resources.

Security Considerations
-----------------------

Some things to think about:

### Authentication of events

Are events to be trusted and acted upon? This requires some form of authentication. On local area networks, it may be reasonable to trust all the devices present that can send events, and this speaks to the point of "good enough security".

### Event integrity

Detecting when an event has been tampered with on route.

### Confidentiality of events

Ensuring that events are only read by the intended parties.

### Event orchestration

Recognizing when an event has been sent out of sequence, and if acted upon could result in harmful or wasteful behaviour.

### Denial of service attacks (event floods)

When a rogue device/service generates sufficiently large numbers of events to have a harmful effect on the performance of other devices.
