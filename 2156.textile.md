#### From "T3.1 Security":http://dev.webinos.org/redmine/projects/wp3-1/wiki/Spec_-_Security#XACML-extended-with-PrimeLife-for-webinos-Data-flow

<pre>
Personal Zone Hub (PZH): defined in the preceding sections, in this context can act in three ways:
- as a data synchronizer towards the request context (via PZP)
 - as a policy synchronizer towards the PDP / PDPC (via PZP)
 - as a credential system (responsible for credential verification) towards the request context (via PZP)
</pre>

#### From "T3.1 Synchronisation":http://dev.webinos.org/redmine/projects/wp3-1/wiki/Spec_-_Synchronisation

<pre>
Synchronization can take place pairwise between devices, or between a device and the personal zone hub.
</pre>

h4. From the "T3.1 draft architecture V2":http://dev.webinos.org/redmine/projects/wp3-1/wiki/Draft_Architecture_V2

* The PZH is permanently addressable on the public internet- this is the address of the personal zone hub (URI)
* These webinos personal zone shall aggregate all information it can about the different devices on which it is present
* when there is access to the public internet, authentication should be provided by the hub
* The personal zone hub and its satellites must support certain key infrastructure functions, to allow apps and devices to work online and offline. e.g GetDevices() - get all devices attached to this zone
* There is not central webinos server or registry. webinos will embrace a distributed architecture, in which multiple commercial entities can fulfil the roles implied by the personal zone.

#### From the "T3.1 High level overlay architecture":http://dev.webinos.org/redmine/projects/wp3-1/wiki/High_level_overlay_architecture

-   The Personal Zone Hub runs on a Web server with a public URL, and provides the means for other people to access your devices and services subject to your preferences.

<pre>
Personal Zone Hub
To enable external access to your zone, webinos defines a Personal Zone Hub
(PZH) as a service that is accessible via the public Internet. This could for
instance, be provided as a value-added service to users by Internet Service
Providers or it could be integrated in the DSL router at home. The Personal Zone
Hub is identified by a URL and supports a RESTful API based upon JSON RPC. The
hub is part of your Personal Zone and supports access by you from other devices,
e.g. when you walk into an Internet Cafe, enabling you to access your Zone’s
devices and services for the duration of a browsing session. It also enables
access by others, subject to the policies that you have defined.

Personal Zone Hubs collectively form a federated social Web with support for
social messaging based upon your relationship to other people. For instance, you
could keep a diary and allow your friends to add comments. Your Zone Hub can
subscribe to near instant notifications when a topic (feed URL) you are
interested in is updated. You can install third party social applications to
suit your interests.

The Personal Zone Hub further provides support for discovering other hubs based
upon someone’s full name or pseudonym. This is implemented as a federated
discovery process across hubs, starting from your own hub. The results are
ranked according to a measure of social relevance, drawing upon information
provided in your profile, or gleaned from other sources. The process is trusted
with access to personal data for ranking purposes, but is designed to avoid
disclosing such data, except as permitted by the owner’s policies. Distributed
hash tables provide a solution for locating candidate matches, but further work
is needed to determine the best approach for implementing a scale-able solution
for privacy friendly ranking of results.

Personal Zone Hubs can also be discovered starting from someone’s email address
or phone number. The email addresses domain name can be used to locate a query
service (typically provided by the domain owner). Note that users may choose to
limit discovery, e.g. to people within a given group, or to prevent discovery
altogether, in which case it is up to the user to communicate the URL for their
Personal Zone Hub to others as needed.

NAT traversal and efficient use of communication networks
The Personal Zone Hub supports the establishment of UDP or TCP connections
across well behaved Network Address Translation boundaries. This will not
normally effect web developers, as the webinos platform hides the establishment
of such connections. The Personal Zone Hub can also help with the efficient use
of communication networks, e.g. by tunneling events through a shared connection
rather than setting up new peer to peer connections, which is expensive on
current mobile networks. Common NAT devices have TCP session timeouts of 30
minutes to several hours versus just a few minutes for UDP. Longer lived
connections can be realized at a virtual level, with SMS wake up messages to
re-establish lapsed connections, providing a means for maximizing battery life
on mobile devices.
</pre>

#### From the "T3.1 Webinos Key Architectural Components":http://dev.webinos.org/redmine/projects/wp3-1/wiki/Webinos_key_architectural_components

<pre>
The critical functions that a Personal Zone hub provides are:

- An fixed entity to which all requests and messages can be sent to and routed on - a personal postbox as it were
 - A fixed entity on the web through which requests and messages can be issued, for security and optimisation reasons.
 - An authoritative master copy of a number or critical data elements that are to synced between Personal Zone Proxy (PZP)s and Personal Zone Hub (PZH), specifically
 - Certificates for Personal Zone Hub (PZH), Personal Zone Hub (PZH) mutual authentication
 - Hashes for user authentication
 - Certificates to authenticate PZXs of trusted people against each other
 - Application identifiers (and/or certificates) of applications granted access into the zone
 - Service identifies (and/or certificates) for trusted services to which the personal zone may attach
 - (Subject to investigation) device identifiers, to assist with platform integrity tests
 - (Subject to investigation) credentials for "non webinos" services to give a pseudo single sign on experience
 - All policy rules, for distributed policy enforcement
 - All relevant context data
 - The functions therefore that a Personal Zone Hub (PZH) can support are
 - User authentication service
 - Personal Zone Proxy (PZP) secure session creation for transport of messages and synchronisation
 - Service session creation for secure transport of messages between applications and services
 - Secure social networking: using the exchanged certificates between trusted people
 - Potentially: single sign on service to other web services, using the Personal Zone Hub (PZH) as a secure proxy
 - A webinos service host: a Personal Zone Hub (PZH) can host directly Services/APIs that other applications can make use of.
 - Context sync: the Personal Zone Hub (PZH) should act as the master repository for all context data
 - A webinos executable host: a Personal Zone Hub (PZH) will be able to run a server resident webinos applications (these will be JavaScript program files wrapped in a webinos application package)

The Personal Zone Hub (PZH) component must implement the following aspects of the specification

Foundations:
 - Rendering and code: the Personal Zone Hub (PZH) will run server resident webinos applications using node.js or similar
 - Packaging: the Personal Zone Hub (PZH) should be capable of unpacking and performing security checks on packed widgets

Security:
 - The Personal Zone Hub (PZH) must store the policy files
 - The Personal Zone Hub (PZH) should act as a server based Policy enforcement point- therefore must mediate all relevant traffic

Messaging: the Personal Zone Hub (PZH) must be able to route messages to the
relevant Personal Zone Hub (PZH) or Personal Zone Proxy (PZP), or in cases
where the message is routed to a locally hosted service, pass it for execution

Synchronisation: the Personal Zone Hub (PZH) must implement the synchronisation algorithm and process synchronisation protocol messages.

Authentication:
 - the Personal Zone Hub (PZH) must allow for a user to authenticate, or raise their authentication level.
 - the Personal Zone Hub (PZH) must authenticate Personal Zone Proxy (PZP)s and other users to set up trusted sessions

</pre>

…

<pre>
There exist the following sub-types of webinos services

- remotable server hosted APIs: these are web services, accessible javascript
 (using JSON RPC). These are hosted by a Personal Zone Hub (PZH) and security
 mediated by the PEP within the Personal Zone Hub (PZH)

</pre>

#### From the "T3.1 Spec Authentication":http://dev.webinos.org/redmine/projects/wp3-1/wiki/Spec_-_Authentication#Personal-Zone-Hub-PZH

<pre>
The PZH is the component in the personal zone which organises trust relationships, issues and maintains certificates, establishes communication channels to other devices and performs authentication on behalf of the user.

During the installation process, the PZH has issued a certificate for the PZP. Whenever the PZP is about to establish a communication channel with the PZH, the PZH validates the certificate which is sent by the PZP. The PZP MUST validate the certificate and it MUST verify that it is one of the certificates which was issued by the same PZH. If the certificate was issued by the same PZH, the PZH establishes a TLS connection with mutual authentication. During this authentication process, the PZH MUST send its own self-signed root certificate to the communication peer. If the PZP sends a certificate which is issued by another PZH, the PZH checks if the certificate is stored in the trusted users cache. If it is stored there, the certificate is considered trusted and a TLS connection with this PZP MUST be established. If the certification chain cannot be validated, the PZH MUST not continue communication with the PZP. The PZH MAY enter installation mode or the PZH MAY enter mode in which new certificates are introduced to the PZH and stored in the trusted user cache. Both these modes MUST NOT be entered and MUST NOT be processed without explicit user consent.
</pre>

h4. From the "PZH Migration change request (plus email conversations)":http://dev.webinos.org/redmine/projects/wp3-1/wiki/PZH_Migration/ page

It was decided that a PZH spec must include something about import and export, and could recommend a non-normative migration process.

h4. From the "Task 3.5 Phase 2- Remote management of personal zones":http://dev.webinos.org/redmine/projects/t3-5/wiki/D036_Remote_Management page

Identifies the following requirements from WP2:

-   Remote management provisioning - "webinos shall facilitate the provisioning of remote webinos components necessary to enable personal device management"
-   Personal device management - "The webinos runtime shall include interfaces to allow end-users to manage the interactions between their personal devices."
-   Application data synchronisation management - "webinos shall allow users to manage applications which synchronise their data with other webinos devices."
-   Policy management - "webinos shall allow users to view and manage application policies."
-   Access control log - "webinos shall allow access control decisions to be logged."

This justifies that webinos should be able to do the following from a PZH web interface:

* Revocation (see earlier sections)
 * Remote wiping of application data

In addition, we can consider the following:
 * intrusion detection
 * "phone home" functionality
 * personal zone hub migration between farms

#### From the "Task 3.5 Phase 1 - Personal Zone Security Specification":http://dev.webinos.org/redmine/projects/t3-5/wiki/Deliverable_Specifications_Personal_Zone_Security

This page describes how the hub helps with revocation, de-registration, migration, secure deletion of data, authenticating users and devices and recovering from loss of credentials.

#### From various authentication specifications

The Personal Zone Hub acts as a certificate authority for the personal zone. It can issue certificates.

The Personal Zone Hub also acts as a revocation authority, creating and synchronising revocation lists. "Details on the WP4 wiki":http://dev.webinos.org/redmine/projects/wp4/wiki/Device_revocation_analysis

"Key management and related issues are here":http://dev.webinos.org/redmine/projects/t3-5/wiki/D036_Device_Cred_Management

The PZH plays a key role in user certificate exchange and authenticating external users to a zone. Details on the "WP4 wiki":http://dev.webinos.org/redmine/projects/wp4/wiki/Certificate_exchange_between_users

#### From the "WP 4 Wiki on PZH Design":http://dev.webinos.org/redmine/projects/wp4/wiki/PZH_design_-_active_or_passive

This page questions whether the PZH should be able to host apps / services that are not defined by us, in an extensible manner. No conclusions drawn.

h4. From the "WP 4 Wiki on PZH Server Requirements":http://dev.webinos.org/redmine/projects/wp4/wiki/PZH_Server_Requirements

This page mostly documents scalability issues and how the PZH should be implemented in a real scenario

h4. From the implementation

The PZH accepts incoming TLS connections from PZPs and other PZHs.
The PZH is largely a conceptual component, with the "PZH Farm" providing a wrapper for all the functionality in a multi-tenant model. The PZH Farm provides the web interface and authentication.

The hub provides:
* a list of zone devices and their connection status.
* a means to revoke devices
* a way of connecting with other users
* a way of adding new devices
* an authentication of the end user
* Context data storage in a SQLite DB.

h3. Differences

* Implementation is behind the spec in the following ways:
**** Synchronisation. There is analysis and some specification detail, but not enough information is provided in the spec. However, nothing has been implemented.
**** The "federated social web" stuff from T3.1 is missing, presumed dead. As is the federated discovery.
**** Discovery in general is unimplemented. WebFinger discovery frequently mentioned.
**** NAT Traversal. Unknown implementation status
* The scope of the PZH has some contradictory specifications. For some, it is just routing, security, webinos-data synchronisation and discovery. In others, it provides additional services. This ought to be settled. In the Oxford meeting in 2012 the full scope was set and removed arbitrary app synchronisation or application execution. These would be implemented by "virtual proxies". suggest that the PZP specs should allow for virtual PZPs, and that this be removed from the PZH.
**** PZH NOT able to run arbitrary server-resident webinos apps, as mentioned in the T3.1 specs.
* Context DB "specifications":http://dev.webinos.org/redmine/projects/wp3-1/wiki/Spec_-_Context2 in T3.1 seem a bit at odds with the implementation. Perhaps reduce scope and rewrite?
* the PZH web interface has gone through lots of implementation iterations and could do with a proper specification page. This ought to list required admin functionality:
**** Logging of events, access control decisions, new users, etc.
**** Zone and Device status
**** Device management
**** Connections to external parties
**** Synchronisation status (not in spec or implementation yet, but might be important)
**** Revocation
**** Remote wipe
* Need to clarify the authentication options now that the implementation is fairly concrete. Also, need to define a process for privilege escalation through the PZH interface.
* Need specifications AND implementation about the import/export process. Data structures missing.
* Need specification outlining the install process for PZHs (see Enrolment)

### Summary analysis

-   Suggest two specifications: one for the PZH web interface, and one for the server aspects. In addition, a deployment scenario non-normative documentation on the PZH + Farm architecture.
-   Web interface should list required functionality presented to the user
    -   Logging of events, access control decisions, new users, etc. (**partially implemented, no spec, update needed**)
    -   Zone and Device status (**partially implemented, no spec, update needed**)
    -   Device management (**partially implemented, no spec, update needed**)
    -   Connections to external parties (**partially implemented, no spec, update needed**)
    -   Revocation (**partially implemented, no spec, update needed**)
    -   Remote wipe (**not implemented, no spec, update needed**)
-   Server aspects should list the precise (and complete) functionality provided to the zone, including
    -   Routing, discovery, synchronisation, logging
    -   Links to the certificate authority and key management documentation from T3.5 - http://dev.webinos.org/redmine/projects/t3-5/wiki/D036_Transport_level_security and http://dev.webinos.org/redmine/projects/t3-5/wiki/D036_Device_Cred_Management
    -   NAT Traversal
    -   Diagrams of the links between components, interfaces, etc, would be valuable here.
