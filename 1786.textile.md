Conclusions
===========

This document, together with webinos deliverable 3.2 "Webinos phase I device, network, and server-side API specifications" and deliverable 3.5 "Webinos phase I security framework" defines the specification used for the first phase of the webinos project.

For the use within the webinos project and for implementation purposes, the Wiki version of this specification is considered to be definitive. For publishing and filing purposes and for offline reading, ‘snapshot’ documents of this Wiki will be created and made available.

The initial webinos platform will be built in WP4 of the webinos project based on this specification. This platform will than be used to demonstrate that it provides the functionality required by existing web applications, adds new concepts and provides new features for future applications and will act as a testing field for innovative concepts, for example in the area of context/analytics/metrics handling.

Based on the experiences with this initial version of the webinos platform, the three specification documents will be updated to reflect the experiences with the platform implementation and the application development on that platform, as well as possible additions required due to technological advances of the underlying hardware.

The updated version of this specification (webinos phase II specification, deliverables 3.3, 3.4 and 3.6) will be released in mid-2012.
