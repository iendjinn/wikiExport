Policy Management and Identity Current State
============================================

Current decisions made:
-----------------------

* Widget access control requirements expressed in config xml
 * Additional access request/ handling errors will be done using Javascript APIs. _TODO_
 * When an app is running, if a specific API is used (e.g. "camera.xyz" or an XHR), this also triggers the PEP to check whether any additional policies apply or obligations are required (e.g. user prompts or otherwise)
 * Access to remote scripts or APIs is dependent on them being "packaged" correctly.
 * P3P Policies to be referenced from application feature request statements in the config xml file

### In the background, policies are enforced:

-   A distributed XACML style system with caching of policies on each device, as per UNICTs architecture
-   The subject of XACML back-end policies will be the application unique identifier, which is synonymous with the application itself. Option ‘0’ from the options page.
-   New or updated policy assertions will be communicated through a synchronised policy repository
-   Any policy updates received should only be interpreted from whitelisted devices or if signed by trusted users.

### On the device:

-   Users have an interface to view policy settings. We will produce some very simple example GUIs
-   Users have some simple methods of applying straightforward policies (e.g. "turn off location data")
-   APIs and data can be tagged so that it fits into categories that specific policies apply to. E.g. "Work data" or "location-information". This implies a local (and perhaps synchronised) database of webinos objects in the runtime stating at least the IRI and applicable tags.

### Identification:

-   All "objects" have an IRI. This includes data, applications, application functionality, extensions, everything.
-   A webinos user identity is defined in the polito architecture document. These are linked to other identities elsewhere (possibly partial identities and assertions?). More work needed here in how to manage users locally and what a app developer will see.
-   Devices need to belong to particular defined "groups" (or "local clouds" or "zones"). Each user will probably have a "owned devices" group but also may belong to others such as "known devices" or "friends devices" or similar.

Open issues:
------------

-   Same-origin security model. How are we allowing XHR requests from apps to other domains? There may be some CORS solutions…
-   What will the javascript APIs for access control information look like to developers? Beyond just a try/catch error handling - how are current policy settings queried? E.g. policy.canAccess("...")? Maybe very similar to the DeviceStatusManager in WAC?
-   Can we include delegation in the policy framework?
-   Can we issue short-lived credentials for sharing device features between devices? OAUTH? We need to go through this with the IDM group.
-   How do we package scripts properly? <script> tag or another "widget"?
-   How do we specify and protect policies on the device, particularly those relating to operator/content provider/manufacturer policies?
