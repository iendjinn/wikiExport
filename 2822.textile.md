microPZP API access control and policy
======================================

An microPZP must be capable of administering access control to the APIs that it exposes. That access control must comply with webinos architecture requirements; however, the full generality of the webinos policy language is not necessary, and a simplified policy scheme is defined.

microPZP policy
---------------

The policy supported by a microPZP is restricted so as to consist of a single policy element only, containing zero or more rules, with a deny-overrides rule combining algorithm.

Each rule is subject to the following restricions:
* the effect must be either deny or permit;
* the rule has a condition element with zero or one subject-match elements; that element, if it exists, has an attr attribute of user-id and a glob and regex-free match attribute;
* the rule has a condition element with zero or one resource-match elements; that element, if it exists, has an attr attribute of api-feature and a glob and regex-free match attribute.

Therefore the policy is, in effect, a simple access control list determining which users can call which APIs or methods. No runtime parameters are supported.

microPZP policy configuration
-----------------------------

Since webinos sync is not required to be supported in a microPZP, any non-default policy must be configured through the microPZP admin interface.

For devices that support policy configuration, the admin API must expose a policies.root configuration element. This is element has collection type, with each member corresponding to a rule; therefore the admin API permits the policy to be set in its entirety in a single operation, or allows individual rules to be added or removed.

A rule is configured as a primitive string value; the string is the JSON string representation of an object representing the rule as follows.

<pre>
JSON: Object
{ â€œeffectâ€ : <effect>
, â€œsubject-matchâ€: { â€œattrâ€: â€œuser-idâ€, â€œmatchâ€: <user-id>}
, â€œresource-matchâ€: { â€œattrâ€: â€œapi-featureâ€, â€œmatchâ€: <api-feature>}
}
</pre>

This format is defined so as to allow some future flexibility to add new attribute types without adding appreciably to the processing complexity.

Policy changes take effect as soon as the admin API operation completes.

There is no requirement for a micro PZP to support the interactive policy editor of the full PZP, or interoperability of policy documents.

A microPZP may provide interactive policy editing if it provides an interactive admin web app.

microPZP policy enforcement
---------------------------

Policy enforcement occurs at the microPZP, although it is also permitted in the case of tethered devices for the proxy to block connection attempts by peers whose access is not permitted by the policy. This prevents the possibility of the limited microPZP resources being overwhelmed by a denial-of-service attack based simply on unauthorized accesses.

The implementation of policy enforcement is intended to be a very simple runtime check, at connection time and invocation time as appropriate to the policy, and the implementation cost of such a check is very small.
