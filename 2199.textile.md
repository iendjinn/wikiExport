PZP
===

In this specification we include information about:
* PZP TLS client and server connection
* PZP modes and states
* Synchronise options
* Revoked PZP

PZP TLS Client and Server Connection
------------------------------------

### TLS Servers on the PZP

| Port | |
| Description | Incoming connections from PZPs (zone devices) as well as connections from external (friend) PZPs. |
| Parameters | rejectUnauthorized = false |
| Trusted certificates | PZP certificates & trusted external PZH master certificates |
|/3. Authentication | Entities with PZP certificates we don’t recognise must go through the peer-to-peer certificate exchange process, documented … |
 | Entities with PZP certificates from other zones are assumed to belong to the user connected to the PZH CA certificate in the chain |
 | Entities with PZP certificates from the personal zone are assumed to be the same user |

### Outgoing TLS connections on the PZP

| Port | |
| Description | Outgoing connections to other PZPs |
| Parameters | |
| Trusted certificates | Just the certificate of the PZP we are contacting, if they are known. If not, then just our own CA certificate. |
|/4. Authentication | The remote party must use the certificate we are expecting, if we are expecting one. |
 | If the remote party is new (e.g. we have not connected to them before, no certificate known) follow the peer-to-peer certificate exchange process, documented … ) |
 | The remote party must be a PZP, not a PZH. |
 | The remote party user identity must be mapped to the identity of its master CA certificate |

PZP Identity
------------

Personal devices are assigned identity that is bound to their owner’s identity. An identity assigned to PZP is of form user identity followed by the device name. This allows PZH to identify PZP id. PZP identity is fetched during its connection to verify if signed PZP is joining in.

PZP Component Interaction

PZP Modes - States
------------------

Various different modes are supported by PZP and depending on modes it could be in different states.

1.  Virgin Mode: This is a special case before device enrollment. Device is not connected to a PZH i.e. it is not certificated
2.  Hub Mode : This is a regular mode where PZP can connect to PZH i.e, it has all the certificates
3.  Peer Mode : This is a regular mode where PZP can connect to another PZP directly.

Depending on the above modes, device can be in different states:
# Not Connected
# Connecting
# Connected
# Disconnected

### Virgin Mode

This mode is a special case before device enrollment. This mode specifies it has not connected to any other device and is not certificated yet. When devices tries to connect the first time to PZH, it will be in a Virgin Mode and after retrieving certificates it will go into the hub mode.

Device in Virgin mode can be in these possible states:
# Not connected : Device has tried connecting to PZH but failed to get certificates or it has not tried connecting at all. It tries resolving DNS address and if successful go to connecting state.
# Connecting : Device has started connecting, depending on device this state could be longer (Mobile connection) or just a transition state. After timeout or in case of fail or socket hangup it should go back to not connected state. If successful go to connected state.
# Connected : This state will be small transition state from this state device stores certificate and if successful goes to hub mode, else goes back to not connected state.

If Virgin mode is successful device should be fully certificated with its PZH.

<div class="uml">
 [*]--> NotConnected
 NotConnected--> Connecting : Successful (Resolved IP Address)
 Connecting --> NotConnected : Error / Timeout/ Hangup
 Connecting--> Connected : Successful
 Connected --> Hub : Successful stored certificate
</div>

h3. Hub Mode

Devices that are certificated are in hub mode. During first time connect device goes from Virgin Connected to Hub Not connected state automatically.

# Not connected: Devices that are not connected to PZH but has the certificate. It is not currently able to establish socket/IP connection with PZH. This could be due to PZH non-availability or device not having network connection (Example 3G Network Not working and device is not connected to WiFi)
# Connecting : Devices are triggered manually or automatically for connecting with the server. If successful device goes in connected state.
# Connected : Devices will be in connected state depending on the optimization. In case of error or timeout or hangup, it goes to disconnected state before going back to not connected state. When in connected state it can trigger peer connection to be initialized.
# Disconnecting: This is a small transition state where clean up operations will take place. After this device will go into not connected state

 NotConnected --> Connecting : Successful
 Connecting--> NotConnected : Error / Timeout/ Hangup
 Connecting --> Connected : Successful
 Connected -up-> Disconnecting: Error/ Timeout/ Hangup
 Disconnecting-up-> NotConnected: No valid connection
</div>

h3. Peer Mode

Device can talk to each other if they are in near by proximity. The advantage of this mode, they do not need to communicate via PZH and can communicate with each other directly.

Triggers is done by pzpUpdate message sent by PZH when PZP is in connected mode, which informs two PZP’s about available PZP’s and . If two PZP’s are available, they can initiate the connection between them. To initiate this peer mode or not should be a preference setting. Once peer is initiated it is separated from hub mode and lives in its own state.

# NotConnected : Device is in hub mode but has not initiated connecting to other peers.
# Connecting : pzpUpdate message has been sent by PZH informing about peers under same PZH. If successful it goes to connected state.
# Connected : Two PZP’s are connected to each other. In case of error it goes to disconnecting state
# Disconnecting: It is a transition state, after this device goes to not connected state.

<div class=“uml”>(
 [*]--> NotConnected
 NotConnected --> Connecting : pzpUpdate message by PZH
 Connecting--> NotConnected : Devices are not available or not from same PZH
 Connecting --> Connected : Successful connected

Synchronise options
-------------------

Users select what should be synchronised between devices and PZH. By default items to synchronise are included in [[Synchronisation]] specification. Compared to PZH, PZP can specify if it also wants to enable application and media synchronisation.

Revoked PZP
-----------

PZP that has been revoked and tries connecting with PZH and get error, "CERT_REVOKED", should trigger all data that is bind with PZH should be removed. All synchronisation data should be also stopped with PZH.
