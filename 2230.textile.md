Application Runtime State Synchronisation
=========================================

{{toc}}

[habib] The spec says state but we are concentrating on both data&state. Suggest renaming spec to data & state instead of just state. the other bit missing in this specification is how these components co-relate to PZP and PZH.

[habib] After reading specification i could not understand the difference in between platform sync and app sync. so what does app sync can do that platform sync cannot do? and how does it resolve conflicts? how app sync differs from browser sync? can the message be reused as defined in platform sync

Developers of distributed applications often need to take care of redistributing short-lived runtime data among all interacting application instances. This runtime data is hold in objects with properties and values carrying the information expressing the current state of an application or parts of it, e.g. the current round setup in a quiz game or play position in a queried media list. To be able to synchronise this information among participating instances messages could be defined and exchanged. But among all the disadvantages of the message passing approach to tackle the runtime state synchronisation problem the most striking ones are the following. Taking care of the synchronisation manually is repetitive, time-consuming and introduces a bunch of message handling logic into the application code. Further, the messages might be too coarse carrying redundant and unchanged data or they might be too fine-grained increasing the message handling complexity.

[habib] either it should be "participating instances", or should be "participating devices, instance messages"

[habib] Messaging passing has not been defined before this, so saying directly disadvantages of message passing does not lead to direct understanding.

The application runtime state synchronisation as described in this section provides a framework that allows to create JavaScript objects that can be automatically synchronised across devices/applications. An application can attach data to an object and webinos will automatically "copy" the changed data to any registered related remote objects so that a remote application has access to the same data. Of course, for efficiency reasons only incremental updates are distributed to ensure that all participants have the same and consistent view on the shared runtime state while not redistributing information redundantly. The shared state approach also includes possibilities to persist objects in order to reactivate the same state when an application is executed next time. In this case an application is not distributed in locality but in time. Such a bootstrap mechanism is hardly feasible with an message passing approach.

[habib] how do we define this object and who creates this object, what if data is a blob or txt file?

Requirements
------------

The incorporation of a JavaScript application runtime state synchronisation mechanism as a webinos platform feature needs to satisfy a number of key requirements to be beneficial for application development.

-   **Simple Usage** Application developers should be able to define explicitly which objects are supposed to be synchronised. Ideally, the synchronisation handling should not affect the application code significantly.
-   **Consistency** All copies of objects to be synchronised should always remain consistent and each peer involved should have the same view on those object. Even, connectivity outages should not affect the consistency of the synchronised objects.
-   **Low latency** Updates should be perceived simultaneously and possible conflicts should be resolved in a fair manner. The delays resulting from synchronisation should be as low as possible, thus not to impair application experience.
-   **Persistency** It should be possible to persist a shared state if all peers get offline and revive the state on demand at a later date.
-   **Privacy** It must be possible to put control on what is synchronised and where, e.g. with which users and applications, preferably by utilizing the webinos policy system.

[habib] From where do this requirements originates? this are not specified in webinos requirements, so mentioning as requirement does not look apt. Better to mention these as advantages from the API.

General approach and scoping
----------------------------

Operational modes for shared objects
------------------------------------

[habib] is this synchronization across personal zones. if we refer to multi-user would be better to include webinos jargons that they are refering to inter zone communication.

A shared state consists of a set of synchronised objects. Access and visibility of those objects determine the operational mode. The access to shared objects can be limited to a single application or can be enabled for different applications that have the permission, e.g. token or key to the according synchronisation session. Another differentiation can be rest upon the visibility to users. Possible configurations are: visibility of shared objects a) limited to a single user, b) unconstrained to all participating users (multi user) or c) constrained to a closed user group. The used mode should be configurable by the application developer. The following table depicts possible combinations of access and visibility of shared objects in a single synchronisation session and gives for each combination example use cases.

  ------------------------------------ ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- -------------------------------------- ------------------------------------------------
  **access Â visibility**             _single user_                                                       _multi user_                 _closed user group_
  _within one application_   application user settings, index position in lists, media playback position   high scores in games                   group chat
  _across applications_      reuse of user preferences                                                     transient user generated information   collaborative components, e.g. text processing
  ------------------------------------ ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- -------------------------------------- ------------------------------------------------

[habib] Does not fit in the sentence "according synchronisation". be rest or based

Object synchronisation protocol
-------------------------------

In the following the AppState Synchronistion protocol (APSYN) is specified. It it based on the Realtime Transaction and Synchronistion protocol (RTSYNC) specified by the Fraunhofer FOKUS project Pulsar [PULSAR]. The round-based protocol is tailored for a centralistic architecture with a single synchronisation entity serving its connected peers. The synchronisation server is responsible for the fair playout of the update messages and resolves possible conflicts. This approach fits well for the synchronisation of the entities present within a single personal zone in hub mode (mainly client-server architecture). For the purpose of synchronisation of peers that are present in different personal zones the protocol is slightly extended. Conceptually, the centralized synchronisation entity remains unchanged, but is given a second role. In addition of being the central entity for the peers within its own personal zone, the synchronisation and control component (CTRL) may become itself a peer for the central synchronisation entity within a different zone. Within a zone where a peer to peer mode is active and peers are interconnected directly without intermediate PZH, one of the peers is selected randomly to act as the synchronisation control component. The same mechanism applies among several equitable interconnected hubs. During the synchronisation setup the distribution of roles (control component, peer) is determined. For the realization of the necessary communication between peers and control component the webinos messaging and routing may be used. In this case, participation of two application instances in one synchronization session is only if an communication path between these peers is provided by the underlying webinos infrastructure. Other communication path, e.g. data channels, are not excluded.

[habib] is it "not excluded" or excluded

### Terminology

-   **Synchronisation and control component (CTRL)** - The server component (dedicated sync-server or process), which is hosting and controlling the synchronised objects and is relaying them to its attached peers. The CTRL component may be in the role of an peer additionally, thus participating in a synchronization session while sharing its view on the shared state with its own peers.

-   **Peer component (PEER)** - One of the peers connected to the central synchronisation and control component.

-   **Synchronisation Round (round)** - The synchronisation process is partitioned into rounds.

-   **Synchronisation message (sync)** - Message sent by the server at the beginning of the round, containing the latest synchronisation updates.

-   **Request message (rqst)** - Message sent by a peer, containing requests for synchronisation.

-   **Join message (join)** - First message sent by a peer willing to join a session.

-   **Init message (init)** - First message sent by a server to a joining peer, containing the current values of all shared objects.

### Overall Operation

The network operation between sync-server (CTRL) and peers (PEER) is illustrated in the following sequence diagram.

<pre>

PEER CTRL PEER
 | |——- sync ——->| ————
 |——- join ——->| |
 | |<—— rqst ——-| round 0
 | | |
 |<—— init ——-|——- sync ——->| ————
 | | |
 |——- rqst ——->|<—— rqst ——-| round 1
 | | |
 |<—— sync ——-|——- sync ——->| ————
 | | |
 |——- rqst ——->|<—— rqst ——-| round 2
 | | |
 . . .
</pre>

The sync-server sends periodically synchronisation messages to all peers. Each peer replies with a request message. Before a peer can participate, it has to join and gets an acknowledgement with the initial object values from the sync-server. The corresponding message flow for a multi user scenarios where two or more personal zones are interconnected is depicted in the following sequence diagram. The master copy of an shared object is still at one single entity but is synchronised with all connected sync-servers in different zones.

p(rev). [habib] in the text it says following seq diagram but the seq diagram is above. the seq diagram specified above differs in terms of diagram specified in other sections others uses plantuml. text explaining how ctrl and peer co-relate to webinos architecture components will be useful. as ctrl could be both pzh and pzp, having info in the text will aid.

The following operation timeline shows how the synchronisation process is constructed.

<pre>

 _ _ _ _ one round _ _ _ _ _ next round _
 /   /
 /  /
 |————|————|————|————|—--> t
   wait /  process /  reply /   wait /
   -I- /   -II- /  -III- /   -I- /

</pre>

A complete PEER/CTRL communication cycle is defined as a round. One round is divided into three phases:

-   (I) Wait for incoming requests. The synchronisation server waits until a request message from each peer has been received. The requests are instantly parsed but not yet applied, since they may interfere with each other. The waiting time is bounded by predefined limit.

[habib] how does sync server know how many req message will come, is it depended on how many joins it receives? (not specified in the text)

-   (II) Process request messages. Without reference to their accurate arrival times all requests issued in the same round are considered as simultaneous. As a consequence concurrent changes of an object value are conflicting and have to be detected and resolved first. Thereafter remaining requests are applied.

[habib] how are conflict resolved?

-   (III) Distribute updates. Peers are notified about the resulting updates of this round. This phase is divided into two parts, which are executed sequentially:
     (1) For each peer an individual synchronisation message is constructed, containing the relevant updates of this round as well as status codes indicating whether their requests were successful.
     (2) The synchronisation messages are sent to the peers, initializing the begin of the next round.

[habib] when does next round begin and is next round details sent in the present round update message.

### Messages

For the communication protocol between the synchronisation control server and its peers a light-weight, text-based protocol is used that does not prescribe a certain transmission technology as long as the requirements for the application state synchronisation are met. Thus, the exchanged messages should be delivered with low latency and not exceed a size for that the transmission time is significantly longer than the waiting phase (I) of a synchronisation round length. The protocol is designed to distribute small size changes to large number of peers. Each message is a JSON ("JavaScript Object Notation":http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4627) [RFC4627] formated text string representing a serialized object that consists of two parts. The unified head part holds generic information like the current round number. The body part carries the main message data and is individually formatted for each message type. White spaces should be ommitted as far as messages remain valid JSON text. The grammatical rules in this document are to be interpreted as described in "Augmented BNF for Syntax Specifications: ABNF":http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5234 [RFC5234]

[habib] below messages does not match the webinos message structure, better to include examples that matches webinos messaging specification. are these message going to use prop message (see service discovery or synchronisation for the messages format) or they are going to be sent as rpc payload? failed to understand message structure relation as they are going to be sent as JSON structure, defining in this format might not be that useful

<pre>
message = BO QM "h" QM NS head VS
 QM "b" QM NS body EO
; Matches: {"h":head,"b":body}

head = BO QM "p" QM NS protocol VS
 QM "c" QM NS client_id VS
 QM "r" QM NS round_number VS
 QM "l" QM NS last_received EO
; Matches: {"p":protocol,"c":client_id,"r":round_number,"l":last_received}

protocol = QM "APSYN/" 2DIGIT QM
; Version of the protocol currently applied, current version number is 01, e.g. "APSYN/01"

client_id = QM *(HEXDIG) QM
; Identifier of the client application, to allow differentiation of multiple instances per peer.

round_number = QM 4HEXDIG QM
; Number of the current round. Rounds are numbered sequentially, beginning with 0001.
; Round sequence is lineary and allows the receiver to order messages and recognize message losses.
; If the round number FFFF is reached it is set back to 0001. Messages not belonging to a
; round (join, init) always use the reserved round number 0000. Thus, this field defines also
; the type of a message.

last_received = QM 4HEXDIG QM
; Identifier of last round number received by a peer or the sync server.
; This enables the peer or the sync server to detect message losses.

body = join_body / init_body / sync_body /Â rqst_body
; The body part may be of one of four types. If the reserved round number 0000 is used then
; the message type is ‘join’ if send by a peer (as value for round_number and last_received)
; and ‘init’ if send by the sync server (as value for last_received).
; If the round number is NOT 0000 then the message type is ‘rqst’ (request) if send by a peer
; and ‘sync’ if send by the sync server.
</pre>

[habib] why is the message has the client_id is not the pzp/pzh id sufficient, why is messaging/rpc id not suffice?

**Join message** (PEER -> CTRL)

The initial message send by a peer to signalize its willing to participate in a synchronisation session. The session will be created by the sync server if the session does not exist already.

<pre>
join_body = BO QM "id" QM NS QM STR QM EO
; Application identifier. This may be an name, key, URI or something else which identifies a specific session on the server.
; Matches: {"id":"appName-sessionId-salt"}
</pre>

[habib] same as before, message structure differs from other specs, better to include format as specified in service discovery or sync. is session really required to be created as you have session manager that does task of creating session between pzp and pzh.

**Init message** (CTRL -> PEER)

Initial message sent by the synchronisation control server to a joining peer. Shared objects are initialized with create actions and the new participating peer is bootstrapped. Afterwards the peer is allowed to send request and accept and process sync messages. Unlike sync messages, the init message type does not allow any other actions than create. Init and sync messages are sent at the same time, both marking the beginning of a synchronisation round.

<pre>
init_body = BO QM "sc" QM NS session_config VS
 QM "cr" QM NS BA create *(VS create) EA EO
; Session configuration data followed by a list of objects and their initial values.

session_config = BO QM "min" QM NS QM 1*8HEXDIG QM VS
 QM "max" QM NS QM 1*8HEXDIG QM VS
 QM "tout" QM NS QM 1*4HEXDIG QM EO
; min round time, max round time, rounds until timeout
</pre>

**Synchronisation message** (CTRL -> PEER)

The synchronisation control server sends sync messages at the beginning of a round. Beside object synchronisations sync messages also include acknowledgements for peer requests. The current round number is identified by its appropriate header part field. The main purpose of sync messages is to distribute the most recent updates for the the shared application runtime state. The likewise carries acknowledgements contain information whether the peer’s requests where successful during the previous round. Sync messages are send periodically even if no updates are to be distributed.

<pre>
sync_body = BO QM "ack" QM NS BA [acknowledgement_list] EA VS
 QM "syn" QM NS BA [sync_action_list] EA EO
; The lists with acknowledgements and updates may be empty if no state changes
; occured in the previous rounds.
; Matches the empty ‘heartbeat’ sync message: {"ack":[],"syn":[]}

acknowledgement_list = code *(VS code)
; Peer requests from the previuos round are acknowledged by an chronological ordered codes list.
; The first entry in the list corresponds to the oldest peer request.

code = 2DIGIT
; Acknowledments are encoded in predefined two-digit status codes of primitive type number.
; See below for a full code table.
</pre>

**Request message** (PEER -> CTRL)

Request messages carry multiple requests for synchronisations. Peers send request messages even if no state changes occurred.

<pre>
rqst_body = BA [sync_action_list] EA
; Contains an ordered list of incremental object update requests.
</pre>

**Actions**

<pre>
sync_action_list = sync_action *(VS sync_action)
; Ordered list of object creation actions or incremental object updates.

sync_action = create / update / delete
; Allowed object update actions.

create = BO QM "t" QM NS QM "cre" QM VS
 QM "i" QM NS object_info VS
 QM "m" QM NS mode VS
 QM "d" QM NS json EO
; Create or initialize an object. Contains the complete object in JSON text
; as described by the according JSON-schema.

update = BO QM "t" QM NS QM "upd" QM VS
 QM "i" QM NS object_info VS
 QM "d" QM NS json EO
; Update an object. The JSON part contains only changed values.

delete = BO QM "t" QM NS QM "del" QM VS
 QM "i" QM NS object_info EO
; Delete an object.

object_info = BO QM "s" QM NS scope VS
 [QM "i" QM NS scope_id VS]
 QM "n" QM NS object_name EO
; Objects are identified by their scope, an optional scope identifier and the object name.

scope = QM ( "G" / "L" / "C" ) QM
; Visibility of an object. (G - Global, L - Local group only, C - Client Object)

scope_id = QM **4HEXDIG QM
; The id of the scope. Especially needed for client objects (scope C), where it specifies
; an objects owner.

object_name = 1**(ALPHANUM / DLR / USC) *(DOT 1*(ALPHANUM / DLR / USC))
; Name of an object. This may point to a nested object or property.

json = JSON-text
; A JSON formatted text. See JSON specification [RFC4627].

mode = "NA" / "RO" / "RW"
; Access mode (NA - No Access, RO - Read Only, RW - Read Write)
</pre>

Architectural embedding
-----------------------

![](appsync_arch.png)

[habib] better to refer peer manager as session manager. what components are introduced by this spec and what is provided by webinos architecture is not clear. The components that look used are messaging and session manager, are there any other component use.

Interface for usage of shared objects in Web runtime environments
-----------------------------------------------------------------

The provision of the webinos application synchronisation in Web runtimes should follow the specification for the "AppState Synchronisation API":http://dev.webinos.org/specifications/new/appstatesync.html. This interface has a high level of abstraction for the purpose of accessing and managing shared objects. The interaction with those objects should be perceived as if they were local. By using this interface webinos applications do not need to take care about the synchronisation issues, as most of it is hidden behind the API.
