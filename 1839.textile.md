New proposed Webinos APIs
=========================

Add APIs that are proposed to be included in task 3.4, phase 2 of webinos API specifications. State high level requirements on the proposed API and consider if there are existing APIs that fulfill what we need.

Actuator API
------------

**Description:**
**Rationale (requirement, architectural reference,etc):** See [[Actuator API scenarios and use cases]]
**Responsible:** Andre Paul / Fraunhofer
**Notes:** An Actuator API draft has already been created by Louay Bassbouss from Fraunhofer. Widl is here: http://dev.webinos.org/redmine/projects/t3-2/repository/revisions/b94e99c812f79b514248532db53192843cec1a0e/entry/sources/widl/actuators.widl

**Following table includes some potential actuator types to be supported by the API. Considering smart home scenarios switch and thermostat are probably the most important ones.**

  ----------------------------------------------------------- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  **High level Requirements**                                 **Notes**
  Provide high level API for switching states of actuators.   In contrast to the sensor API the actuator API should allow to influence the state of a device instead of just reading out sensor information. For each actuator implementation there should be a sensor implementation for also reading values/the current state
  Progress updates                                            Because changing the state of an actuator can take some time the API should provide the possibility to receive updates while changing the state of an actuator.
  Generic API                                                 Like the Sensor API the Actuator API should be generic in order to support future extensions with additional actuator types
  Possible Actuator: Switch                                   A switch commonly only has one input which represents the state of the switch such as ON/OFF, TRUE/FALSE, 0/1 etc.
  Possible Actuator: Thermostat                               Setting a target temperature, having min and max values.
  Possible Actuator: Linear motor                             Setting speed and direction of the linear motor
  Possible Actuator: Vibrating motor                          Setting the intensity of the vibration motor
  Possible Actuator: Rotational motor                         Setting the speed and direction of a rotational motor (e.g., in Hz (cylces per second)
  Possible Actuator: Servo motor                              Setting the desired angle of the servo motor
  Possible Actuator: Swivel motor                             Setting three dimensions for a swivel and getting min max values

**Decision:**

Bluetooth API
-------------

**Description:**
**Rationale (requirement, architectural reference,etc):**
**Responsible:** Ziran Sun/Samsung
**Notes:** Based on Pulse meter demo? Note that W3C Device API WG has started to discuss use cases for a Bluetooth API, http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-device-apis/2012Apr/0030.html.

|**Candidate existing API**|**Short Description**|**Implementation Status**|**Gaps**|**Notes**|
|BTfindservice(serviceType, callback)|To find Bluetooth devices that support specified service type|Linux|Split into scan, pairing devices APIs |webinos Implemenation|
|BTbindservice(service, callback)|To connect with the found Bluetooth device and see all visible file folders|Linux|OPP profile implementation - need to make the API clearer|webinos Implemenation|
|BTlistfile(folder, callback) | To list available files/folders in the connected Bluetooth device|Linux|OPP profile implementation - need to make the API clearer|webinos Implemenation|
|BTtransferfile(filename, callback) |To get specific file from the Bluetooth device|Linux|OPP profile implementation - need to make the API clearer|webinos Implemenation|
|HRMfindservice(serviceType, callback) | To connect to a HRM and fetch heart beat data| Android|SPP profile implementation - need to make the API clearer|webinos Implemenation|

**Decision:** Current approach (May 3rd 2012) is that a low level Bluetooth API will not be specified by Webinos. Instead new sensor types for which we have use cases will be added to the Webinos Sensor API. It is the implementation of the Sensor API that accesses the different sensors using the relevant low level protocols, e.g. Bluetooth.

Media Capture and Streams (aka getUserMedia API)
------------------------------------------------

**Description:** Getting access to local devices that can generate multimedia streams
**Rationale (requirement, architectural reference,etc):** See [[getUserMedia API/PeerConnection API scenarios and use cases]]
**Responsible:** Anders Isberg / Sony Mobile and Martin Lasak / Fraunhofer
**Notes:**

|"W3C getusermedia":http://dev.w3.org/2011/webrtc/editor/getusermedia.html|Access to the LocalMediaStream object by calling the getUserMedia API, this object may be then consumed by the video/audio tag or used by the PeerConnection API to be consumed remotely. |As of 26th, April available browser implementations exists for Google Chrome (Canary, 20.0.1117.0) navigator.webkitGetUserMedia, Opera (Labs, 12.00 alpha) navigator.getUserMedia|Comments by Nick Allott:
a) We need to be able to remotely invoke
b) It needs to be calleable from service context â€“ not just browser context (ie form pzp)
c) The design is created to be used from browser security context . We need to dilute the UI requirements on notification from native or service context use
d) Are there any issues with cross device content stream compatibility /negotiation â€“that arenâ€™t covered
e) Is there a use case for accessing the binary data stream direct? Can this be done out of the box?||

**Decision:**

PeerConnection API
------------------

**Description:** A PeerConnection allows two users to communicate directly, browser-to-browser. Communications are coordinated via a signaling channel provided by script in the page via the server, e.g. using XMLHttpRequest (or WebSockets)
*Rationale (requirement, architectural reference,etc): _Assume same scenarios and use cases as for getUserMedia API_
**Responsible:** Anders Isberg / Sony Mobile and Martin Lasak / Fraunhofer
**Notes:** Needed to remotely access media streams.

In addition, to be able to do NAT traversal STUN server must be included in the architecture.|

**Decision:**

oAuth API
---------

**Description:** provides server-side authentication, in order to allow using third-party external services.
**Rationale (requirement, architectural reference,etc):** Fulfill missing functionality. Issue brought up while developing applications on the top of webinos framework. See "oAuth API scenarios and use cases":http://dev.webinos.org/redmine/projects/wp2-4/wiki/Proposed_Update_OAuth_support
**Responsible:** Paolo Vergori / ISMB
**Notes:** based on the undocumented oAuth api that has been implemented as a server-side authentication mechanism against Twitter. Authentication against other could also be hosted as needed.

  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  **High level Requirements**                                                                                                             **Notes**
  Get session token from Twitter with oAuth protocol v1.0a.                                                                               This is done now by providing consumer_key, consumer_secret, access_token, access_token_secret to the api as parameters. It would be better to design the api to get access to the consumer_key and consumer_secret (application pair of keys that MUST BE securely stored) and get the other two from redirect the user to Twitter and authenticate him there. Hence, users keys shouldn’t be stored, now, since this isn’t secure nor scalable.
  Specify Twitter ad-hoc functionalities, such as getTimeline, getMentions, postMessage, sendDirectMessage, getFollowers and getFrineds   These functions needs to be embedded server-side on a webinos module, just if the aim is to control all the communication to the tird-party service. From a design perspective, it would be useful to transfer the session_token, therefore the session handling, to the application and allow it to deal with the webservice.

[[oAuth investigation]]

**Decision:** This will not be a task 3.4 API as it will be implemented on a server as a service. The task 3.3 delivery will contain informative text on the oAuth API.

Telephone API
-------------

**Description:**
**Rationale (requirement, architectural reference,etc):** See [[Telephone API scenarios and use cases]]
**Responsible:** Nick Allott / Impleo

**Decision:** This will not be part of the task 3.4 delivery. Instead it will be added later based on work in the W3C System Applications WG.

Privacy aware Location and Proximity API
----------------------------------------

**Description:** Enable location aware apps to determine location and proximity in an abstract way that does not ‘leak’ too much information
**Rationale (requirement, architectural reference,etc):** Physical proximity is determined through the discovery API. Location is determined through the GeoLocation API. The combination of these allows location-aware apps to function (http://dev.webinos.org/redmine/projects/wp2-4/wiki/WOS-UC-TA7-004). However, according to the webinos white paper we strive to protect the privacy of webinos users. For this, not only policies are required, but also a more ‘need to know’ approach.
**Responsible:** Victor Klos / TNO
**Notes:**

  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
  **High level Requirements**                                                                **Notes**
  be able to query another party on location and receiving an abstract response              Like location is ‘HOME’ or ‘WORK’
  be able to query another party on proximity by having the caller supply his own location   Are we proximate, I am at (lat x/lon y)?
  support throttling per relevant policy                                                     Making sure a users’ actual location isn’t queried by sending 1M requests
  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Decision:** There will not be a separate "Privacy aware Location and Proximity API". Instead this functionality be added to the Context API.

Tethering API
-------------

**Description:** Easily sharing mobile internet connectivity to somebody who is near you
**Rationale (requirement, architectural reference,etc):** One of the scenario’s is about local, hub-less connectivity. In many cases, one of the participants in that scenario may actually have connectivity to the greater internet and would possibly be willing to share that. See [[Tethering API scenarios and use cases]]
**Responsible:** Victor Klos / TNO
**Notes:**

|**High level Requirements**|**Notes**|
|allow someone access to ones tethering device capability without exchanging credentials, SSID etc manually||

**Decision:** WITHDRAWN, see link in rationale

Secure Elements API
-------------------

**Description:** Provide a means for applications to invoke functions on contact or contactless smart cards via a lightweight implementation of the APDU protocol.

**Rationale (requirement, architectural reference,etc):** See [[Secure Elements API scenarios and use cases]]
**Responsible:** Dave Raggett, W3C
**Notes:** This would provide valuable implementation experience into standardization work in the W3C System Applications and NFC Working Groups.

  ----------------------------------- -----------------------------------------------------------------
  **High level Requirements**         **Notes**
  iteration through terminals         there could be multiple named secure elements
  format commands                     convenience functions for assembling APDU command messages
  send command and process response   response should be handled asynchronously
  access response                     convenience functions for accessing response status and payload

**Decision:** This

Webinos Core API
----------------

*Description: Webinos Core API provides information about the connected pzp and pzh information.
*Rationale (requirement, architectural ): [[Core Management API and Use Cases]]
*Responsible: Habib Virji, Samsung
**Notes: This API will be enhanced to include Webinos details, the details it will include are the PZP name, the PZH name, the application identifier and the connection status of the PZP with the PZH and the peer devices.**
**Decision:** There will not be a separate "Webinos Personal Zone API". Instead this functionality be added to the Webinos Core API.

Web Notifications API
---------------------

**Description:** API to show small notifications to the user in order to notify that "something" that could be of interest to the user happened
**Rationale (requirement, architectural reference,etc):** During the first phase of the project this functionality was implemented in the webinos Widget API. W3C developed a specific API for this so that we should consider to change our specifications to use the W3C one.
**Responsible:** AndrÃ© Paul, Fraunhofer FOKUS
**Notes:**

  ----------------------------- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  **High level Requirements**   **Notes**
  Display notification          An application want’s to notify that something happened to the user (new eMail, task completed, etc)
  Discard notification          The user should be able to discard the notification
  Accept notification           The user should be able to accept the notification (for example in order to activate the notifying application so that more details can be shown)
  Close a shown notification    An application should be able to close a shown notification, for example in order to update the notification with a newer one
