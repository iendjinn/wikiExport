Analysis of the ENISA HTML5 Security Report
===========================================

The report is linked here - http://www.enisa.europa.eu/act/application-security/web-security/a-security-analysis-of-next-generation-web-standards/at_download/fullReport

The following sections cover threats and recommendations relevant to webinos

Threat: GEOLOC-SECURE-3.Cache Polling
-------------------------------------

### Details

> The use of the geo-location cache API allows the explicit retrieval of the latest geo-location entry from a cache, according to the freshness criteria specified in the query. While this feature reduces the power-intensive geo-location queries, it also allows an attacker to retrieve a previous location of the end-user, as well as timing information on that particular location. The specification does not provide upper limits on the lifetime of geo-location cache entries.

Recommendation: Controlling Functionality
-----------------------------------------

### Details

> current restrictive systems (i.e. the sandbox attribute [HTML5ATTR-SECURE-2] or the Widget Access Request Policy [WARP-SECURE-1.Coarse-Grained Approach]) are very coarse-grained and only offer the option of enabling or disabling a certain functionality. It is currently impossible to integrate third-party functionality into a web application (e.g. in a mashup scenario) while applying the least-privilege security principle. In such a scenario, either access to all security-sensitive APIs is given while relying on the same-origin policy and user-consent mechanisms, or scripts are completely disabled.

> One approach is the use of additional fine-grained policies. Such policies are typically enforced at the client-side, but are often provided by the server. There are several types of policies available, either in the form of additional response headers page (e.g. Content Security Policy [27] and X-Frame-Options [26]) or embedded in the page. The latter can be achieved by using an inline reference monitor technique (e.g. ConScript[19], Safe JavaScript Wrappers[20,21], WebJail[22]) or by ensuring the safety of the language, based on the capability security model (e.g. Caja [23]).

Essentially, it should be easy to integrate untrusted external content into your HTML5 page with fine-grained security policies.

Recommendation: Permission System Design
----------------------------------------

### Details

> Several specifications include a permission system, without any consistency between these
systems. This is troublesome, since some systems are fairly weak compared to other
systems. One good example is the Geo-location API versus the System Information API,
where the latter is much more extended (e.g. it requires permission for a pair of origins for
a framed document and distinguishes between one-shot vs. monitoring permissions).

…

Recommendation: User Interfaces
-------------------------------

### Details

> The specifications do not include much detail about the user interfaces for giving permissions and managing permissions. Typically, they require that the origin of the document is displayed. One major missing item is the nature of the permission (one-shot vs watching process) as well as the actual document requesting it (e.g. is it sandboxed or framed? is it visible?). For managing permissions, the specifications typically state that it should be clear and easily usable. This is very vague and is not even a strong requirement (should instead of must).

> One recommendation is to extend the specifications to include more UI requirements. At least all the aspects of the requested permission should be present. For managing the permissions, the specifications should describe how it should happen (not what it should look like). For example, they could state that "A user must be able to get an overview of all assigned permissions, grouped per origin".

> A second recommendation is to include these UI requirements into the abovementioned separate permission specification, which is then referenced from all other specifications requiring a permission system. This ensures consistency and facilitates improvements or extensions of the permission system.

Recommendation: End User Policing
---------------------------------

### Details

> Several specifications depend on the end user to ensure security, typically by means of a permission system. With the rapid development of new APIs offering new functionality, this approach is reaching its limits. Typical web users are unable to assess the ramifications of granting certain permissions to certain origins. Additionally, involving the user too often might quickly lead to blindly approving permissions.

> A first recommendation is to require an awareness indicator, so the user knows when a site is using a granted permission (e.g. when a site is locating the user). Currently, this is only included as a suggestion in the Geo-location API and is missing from other APIs, such as the System Information API.

> A second recommendation is to offer the users a way to select predefined security profiles or to create a security profile (e.g. by means of a wizard, which could explain the ramifications of sharing your location and then provide the option to allow this or not.). Once a security profile is chosen, it is used to determine the appropriate actions when a site requests permission for an action.
