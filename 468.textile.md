Task 3.5 Security Architecture (University of Oxford):

The security architecture will build upon several key components: the BONDI model [BOND09a], the
Advanced Trusted Environment [OMTP09], and relevant W3C standards, but in order to deliver the seamless
interoperability - one might say intertrustability - these must be integrated in a coherent manner. Key elements of
this task are:

-   Integration of a secure execution model - with or without a trusted environment in the platform.
-   User-centric privacy control: ability to manage this through various interfaces; option to outsource it to a service provider, security specialist (e.g. anti-virus company), or community effort - or some combination of these.
-   Modal separation of work and personal data. Remote security controls for work data in particular.
-   Data (physical) locations; when and which data should be encrypted and when not, which may incorporate key-Management and trusted entities.
-   Models of local and remote access control to data and APIs.
-   Identity and authentication: durable models which work on many platforms.
-   Robustness in the face of (distributed) denial of service attacks (and mitigation against unwitting participation).
-   This architecture must be designed to be simple enough to be comprehensible - otherwise a loss of security results - and yet customizable to a very large range of applications and use cases. Clearly, it will be driven by the project use cases in the first instance. In addition, the architecture must be compatible with cloud security models arising from the Cloud Security Alliance and others. The security architecture will be permanently updated according to internal and external feedback and evaluations to improve the security framework.

The result of this task (to be provided in Deliverables D03.5 and D03.6) will comprise:

-   Description of security model for webinos, showing how it integrates with webinos core and component architecture
-   Development guidance/best practice in webinos security (technical, organisational, and user guidance)
-   Framework for security evaluation

The following project partners will participate in this task.

ERCIM, University of Oxford, TIS, BMW F+T, SEMCA, Samsung, Polito, DOCOMO, Impleo.
