PolicyManagementAPI
===================

Scope
-----

This API enables webinos applications to manage policies. The feature http://webinos.org/core/policy-management defined in ([[PolicyManagementAPI#PolicySPECS|PolicySPECS]]) and its parameters (TBD) determine the set of policies that a specified application is able to view or modify.

First draft of Policy Editing API
---------------------------------

### PolicyEditor Class

-   -PolicySet **getPolicySet** (policySetId)-
-   -PolicySet[] **getAllPolicySets** ()-
-   **getPolicySet** (policysetId, policysetFoundSuccessCallback, errorCallback)
-   **save** (policyset)

### PolicySet Class

-   -**addPolicy** (newPolicy, position)-
-   **addPolicy** (newPolicyId, combine, description, position, successCallback)
-   -**addPolicySet** (newPolicyset, position)-
-   **addPolicySet** (newPolicysetId, combine, description, position)
-   **addSubject** (subjectId, matches)
-   -Policy **createPolicy** (newPolicyId, combine, description)-
-   -PolicySet **createPolicySet** (newPolicysetId, combine, description)-
-   -Policy **getPolicy** (policyId)-
-   **getPolicy** (policyId, policyFoundSuccessCallback, errorCallback)
-   -PolicySet **getPolicySet** (policySetId)-
-   **getPolicySet** (policysetId, policysetFoundSuccessCallback, errorCallback)
-   **removePolicy** (policyId)
-   **removePolicySet** (policySetId)
-   **removeSubject** (subjectId)
-   String **toJSONString()**
-   **updateAttributes** (policySetId, combine, description)
-   **updateSubject** (subjectId, matches)

### Policy Class

-   **addRule** (ruleId, effect, condition, position)
-   **addSubject** (subjectId, matches)
-   **removeRule** (ruleId)
-   **removeSubject** (subjectId)
-   String **toJSONString** ()
-   **updateAttributes** (policyId, combine, description)
-   **updateRule** (ruleId, condition)
-   **updateSubject** (subjectId, matches)

OLD VERSION
===========

Methods (currently implemented for demo purposes but not present in master branch)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-   **getPolicy (id)** (TODO add callbacks?)
    Retrieves a policy/policy-set element (JSON format) with the specified "id". In the case that the application not is granted to access requested policy/policy-set elements, the method returns an empty JSON object.
    If "id" is null the method tries to retrieve the policy associated with the app (a policySet with the application id as its id)

-   **setPolicy (id, policySet)** (TODO add callbacks?)
    Asks the Policy Manager to set a policy/policy-set element (passed in JSON format) updating the one with the same "id". The method returns "true" or "false". An application not granted to update the requested policy/policy-set element will receive "false".
    If "id" is null the method tries to set the policy associated with the app (a policySet with the application id as its id).

Proposal
--------

-   **getPolicyFiles()** returns an array with identifiers of the policy files available (user policy, app policy, manufaturer policy, decision policy)
-   **getPolicy(fileId, policyId)** retrieves an object containing the policy included in the policy-set with id "policyId" from the policy file identified by "fileId". If policyId is null it retrieves the whole content of the policy file. If the subject cannot access the selected policy file or policy-id is not valid, it will return null.
-   **getPolicyIds(fileId, policyId)** retrieves the list of policy/policy-set ids included in the policy-set identified by policyId; if fileId is not accessible, if policyId is not valid or identifies a policy, it will return null;
-   **getTarget(fileId, policyId)** retrieves the target (JSON) of the policy identified by policyId; if the policy has no target returns null; if policy id identifies a policy set an error is raised;
-   **getRules(fileId, policyId)** retieves (JSON) the list of rules of the policy identified by policyId; if policy id identifies a policy set an error is raised;
-   **addPolicy(fileId, policyId, newPolicyType, newPolicyPosition, newPolicyDescription)** adds an empty policy-set or a policy with deny all (depending on newPolicyType) in position newPolicyPosition to the policy-set identified by policyId; if policyId is a policy or cannot be accessed null is returned; otherwise returns the id of the new policy/policy-set.
-   **removePolicy(fileId, policyId)** removes the policy/policy-set; no action will take place if the user has no access to selected policy/policy-set or if it does not exists; if policyId is null no action will take place.
-   **addSubject(fileId, policyId, attribute, match)** adds the subject to the target of the specified policy; if a subject with the same attribute is already present it will be overwritten;
-   **removeSubject(fileId, policyId, attribute)** removes the subject with specified attribute from the target of the specified policy;
-   **addRule(fileId, policyId, effect, feature, params)** adds a rule to the specified policy;
-   **save(fileId)** saves modifications to policy in file identified by fileId

Questions:
----------

A practical one: how to enforce the policy-set has an unique id between all Personal Zone policies? There should be a coherent counter between all applications (the policy editor included) that keep track of the creation of a new policy set?

[Stefano] The id should be unique among all policy files on the device?
