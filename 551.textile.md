20110328 conf call on User Identity Management
==============================================

Date: 28 Mar 2011
Time: 15:00 - 16:00 CEDT
Bridge: PowWowNow, _Enhanced Access_, PIN: 312806, "Dial-in numbers":http://pdf.powwownow.com/pdf/GBR_en_pwn-dial-in-numbers.pdf

Agenda:
* Discussion of the new version of the user identity management architecture
* Discussion of interfaces to the other subtopics
* Presentation of latest findings on related work

Action Items:
* all: check new arch doc until 30 Mar 2011
* Nick: talk to Dave about authentication (browser or own authentication architecture) during review meeting 1 Apr
* Nick: iterate through identity management use cases until 29 Mar
* DOCOMO: finalise SotA investigation on SIM identification and SIP/XMPP comparison

Attendees:
* Sven Lachmund (DOCOMO)
* Christian Schaefer (DOCOMO)
* Nick Allott (Impleo)
* Andrea Atzeni (Polito)

Discussion:
* architecture update (Polito)
**** Out there on the wiki since today
**** Little updates on the core
**** No further comments received since last 2 weeks
*** No need for authentication if User wants to connect to services which need no authentication
*** Nick: user is always to be authenticated to know who wants to access the resource even if there is no need for authentication for an app/device for using the resource, but this can only be checked in the policy if the user is known
**** Anonymity
*** Group signature, DAA and Idemix investigated
*** Anonymous cloud allows devices to use a sig which is shared among all members of the same anonymous cloud, thus users cannot be distinguished
**** If the webinos network = anonymous cloud, only the device used is anonymised, but not the user
**** Makes probably sense to defer anonymity to second project phase
**** Zero knowledge proofs may make sense here (ask Dave)
**** Auth in the browser
*** Idea by Dave: credentials reside in each userâ€™s browser on all devices
** How to allow SSO across all devices of the same user?
**** How to exploit non-webinos identities for auth?
*** This is why the auth arch is proposed for webinos
** Next steps
*** Check new arch document (all)
*** Go through Nickâ€™s use cases and see if the arch covers them
*** Check against policy examples of John (implicit binding of user and app after authenticating the user)
*** match SotA with arch
* other subtasks
**** discovery
*** addressing the user based on crypto identifiers should be discussed with discovery and overlay subtopic people
*** common identification of users and devices to be sorted out in the f2f meeting in May as both subtopic groups are not yet ready for such a discussion
**** overlay network
*** to be discussed with Dave
** Privacy & security
*** Currently only requirement: unlinkability of users and identifiers
* SotA
** SIP and XMPP ongoing investigations (needs more time due to complexity)
**** DAA, group signatures and Idemix are updated on the wiki
**** SIM identification ongoing investigations
* General remarks by Nick: to push integration with other subtopics forward, we can
**** Integrate with Daveâ€™s demo
**** Think from developerâ€™s perspective in order to understand their needs
***** Start with existing APIs and see how far they meet our requirements

Next meeting: conf call on Wed 30 Mar 2011, 17:00 CEDT
