Task 3.4 status overview
------------------------

See slide 2-4 in "Task 3_4 session Ghent June 20 2012":http://dev.webinos.org/redmine/attachments/2185/Task_3_4_session_Ghent_June_20_2012.pptx

General issues

Slide 5 in "Task 3_4 session Ghent June 20 2012":http://dev.webinos.org/redmine/attachments/2185/Task_3_4_session_Ghent_June_20_2012.pptx

-   W3C System Applications and NFC WGs starting up. Their work is very relevant for Webinos APIs. We should work with these groups and provide input. If we want to use APIs created by these groups we can take them to webinos even after teh task 3.4 delivery at the end of August.

-   widlproc for windows has been built by Paddy and Nick. Will be uploaded to the task 3.4 API specification Redmine repository. This means that windows users could test generate the API specifications on their local machines before pushing to the Redmine repository.

-   Wrapper specifications for referred unmodified APIs. Dominique has a tool that extracts the raw widl from HTML specifications. This will be used to support the development tool chain. There seems to no other reasons to have Webinos wrapper specifications for unmodified API specifications. Dom Action: "Replace links to Webinos wrapper specifications with links to original referred specification":http://dev.webinos.org/redmine/issues/909

Issues on existing APIs
-----------------------

Slide 6 and 7.

-   Service Discovery API:
    -   Removing createService, use alternative solution to get earlier selected default service. Alexander Action: "Service Discovery API - Update specification":http://dev.webinos.org/redmine/issues/916
    -   Need for Device Discovery API? The conclusion was to have extension mechanism to the Service Discovey API where developers gets access to low level apiâ€™s so 3:e party developers could develop new discovery plug-in modules that could find new type of services. My view is that we should not expose a specific device discovery API
    -   Explanation on binding APIs to access discovered services to service object. Anders Isberg Action: "Service Discovery API: Explanation on access to remote Services":http://dev.webinos.org/redmine/issues/917

-   NFC API: Presentation by Dave, "NFC":http://dev.webinos.org/redmine/attachments/download/2157. New API will build upon ideas in the B2G, PhoneGap, Tizen, and webinos phase 1 APIs for NFC and aligned to the anticipated direction for the proposed W3C NFC Working Group. Dave Action: "NFC API":http://dev.webinos.org/redmine/issues/910

-   Payment API:
    -   Discussion objectives with Payment API. Dave Action: "Payment API - Initiate a discussion on the obejctives with the Webinos Payment API":http://dev.webinos.org/redmine/issues/911
    -   Current API is agnostic to payment provider but opinions expressed that we need agreements with payment provider(s). Then it will be easy to create a payment API. Kamran Action: "Payment API - Discuss with conatcts on potential payment providers":http://dev.webinos.org/redmine/issues/913

-   W3C Gallery API: We refer to a W3C API that has been shelved by W3C, i.e. it is no longer worked on and supported. Stefano V Action: "Gallery API - Investigate candidates for Gallery API for webinos and propose a solution":http://dev.webinos.org/redmine/issues/914

Issues on new proposed APIs
---------------------------

Slide 8 and 9.

Motivation / background for new APIs must be provided (comment from last EU-review). See "mail June 5":https://listen.fokus.fraunhofer.de/sympa/arc/webinos-wp3-ml/2012-06/msg00021.html .

Actions for all owners of new APIs to provide this background information and then edit the tangible API specification:

-   Generic Actuator API - Andre
-   oAuth API â€“ Paolo
-   Telephone API â€“ Nick
-   Privacy aware Location and Proximity API â€“ Victor
-   Tethering API â€“ Victor
-   Webinos management API - Habib

Regarding support for pulse meter demo Ziran has action "Add proposed additional sensor types to Sensor API":http://dev.webinos.org/redmine/issues/874
but stated that this is difficult as different pulse meters produces different types of data. The alternative is a low level Bluetooth API. Claes action: "Bluetooth API - Investigate existing Bluetooth API solutions":http://dev.webinos.org/redmine/issues/921

Web Intents for Webinos?
------------------------

Slide 11 and 12.

"Web Intents for Webinos investigation wiki page":http://dev.webinos.org/redmine/projects/t3-4/wiki/Web_Intents_for_Webinos

Did not take detailed discussion note. Issues are described at wiki referred above.

**+*Conclusion:*+** Web Intents has a strong momentum within W3C, Google and other players. We must investigate what Web Intents means for Webinos but we can’t take any decisions without further investigations and prototyping. Investigation result will be included in the task 3.4 delivery report on August 31.
