FailCallBack
============

<pre class="webidl prettyprint">
 // call back with associated operation has failed
 callback FailCallBack = void ();
</pre>

This is a call back for notifying the failure of an operation such as registering a listener for the presence of NFC tags.

_Should this be extended to pass some information on the nature of the failure, assuming that such information is available from the underlying implementation?_
