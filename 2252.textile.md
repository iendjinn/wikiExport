Introduction
============

This section describes the RPC mechanism and protocol used in webinos. This section also describes the dependencies between RPC and the messaging specification since RPC objects are sent as payload of messaging packages rather then, for example, direct requrests on a RESTful interface. This also means that the RPC part of a call to a remote system follows the JSON-RPC 2.0 specification but together with messaging part it does not. Thus, it will be not possible to post just a JSON-RPC message to an endpoint in order to get it executed. In addition the webinos messaging must be wrapped around the calls.

In addition to the general RPC protocol and field encoding specifications this section also lists all RPC messages that are made between webinos entities. This especilly means the this section provides the mapping between webinnos JavaScript APIs and RPC calls.

RPC protocol definition
=======================

The webinos RPC protocol should be compliant to JSON RPC 2.0 as specified at http://jsonrpc.org/spec.html. Before reading further ensure that you are familiar with the JSON RPC version 2.0 specification.

webinos RPC Requests
--------------------

According to JSON-RPC 2.0 a RPC request object needs to have four members that are briefly described as:

-   _jsonrpc_ A String that represents the protocol version used. It MUST be exactly "2.0" when using webinos.
-   _method_ A String containing the name of the method to be invoked. The naming sheme used in webinos is described further later.
-   _params_ A Structured value that holds the parameter values to be used during the invocation of the method. This member MAY be omitted.
-   _id_ An identifier that MUST contain a String, a Number, or NULL value if included.

The method field itself is encoded using three parts as follows:

**method:** <type>@<instance>.<function>

-   <type>, a service type identifier that matches the service type followed by a ‘@’ symbol, for example as used to select a service while using the findService method of the webinos service discovery API
-   <instance>, a service instance identifier that is used to specify the specific service to be used followed by a ‘.’ symbol, for example in case multiple services of the same type are available
-   <function>, a method identifier that specifies the method that should be invoked on the target service

The <instance> value is not further specified and can be implementation specific. It must be a locally unique identifier of the related service so the a RPC calls can be uniquely assigned to a specific service. For example if on a PZP two services of the same type are available then the <instance> must be different in order to select the desired service for invocation. The <instance> value must be propagated by the service discovery so that client side service bindings know about the service type and the service instance id (see ServiceDiscvoery RPC protocol). Both, in addition to the actual method, must be used to create the method field of the RPC request for service invocation requests.

Following a full generic request message format and an example that invokes a function called exampleFunction of an example service with type _http://webinos.org/api/example_ on a PZP is provided. The actual service address in terms of the PZP where the service is running is not part of the JSON-RPC message, it is handled through the messaging layer as shown in the next example.

**Generic message format**

<pre class="javascript">
JSON: Object
{
 id: <id>
 jsonrpc: "2.0"
 method: <type>@<instance>.<function>
 params: {
 <param1>: <value1>
 <param2>: <value2>
 }
}
</pre>

To summarize the generic syntax of webinos RPC calls: _id_ is a locally unique id created by the origin of an RPC request so that responses can be mapped to requests. The _id_ field can be omitted if responses are not expected. _jsonrpc_ is the static version info field which MUST not be other than "2.0". _params_ is a RPC message specific object that can contain any JSON data and is used as input parameters for the invoked method.

**Example about how it can look in an implementation**

<pre class="javascript">
JSON: Object
{
 id: "2"
 jsonrpc: "2.0"
 method: "http://webinos.org/api/example@6e6885b25a7ddb5f4658e7a599d1fc17.exampleFunction"
 params: [
 "example result"
 ]
}
</pre>

In this example the params field is just an array of length 1 which is used for a function that just takes one argument. The method field consists of the three parts service type and instance identifier as described above and the exampleFunction function that should be invoked at the target service.

The example above only shows the RPC part of a message transaction. A full example that also includes messaging and routing information is given below.

<pre class="javascript">
JSON
{
 from: "PZ_Name/example_Pzp/0"
 id: 33
 payload: {
 id: "2"
 jsonrpc: "2.0"
 method: "http://webinos.org/api/test@6e6885b25a7ddb5f4658e7a599d1fc17.exampleFunction"
 params: [
 "example input parameter"
 ]
 }
 resp_to: "PZ_Name/example_Pzp/0"
 to: "PZ_Name/example_Pzp"
 type: "JSONRPC"
}
</pre>

This shows that a RPC relies on the messaging part which needs to know the address of the service in order to forward the RPC request to the needed PZP. This information must be provided by the service discovery module (see detailed service discovery API protocol to see how this information is propagated) in order to add the service address information when the RPC module creates JSON-RPC messages that should be send to another PZP or PZH using the messaging and session components of webinos. For detailed information about the messaging related attributes of the JSON structure please look into the Messaging and Routing specification.

webinos RPC Requests with subscriptions
---------------------------------------

JSON-RPC directly has inbuilt support only for request/response or notification messages. It does not support an integrated mechanism for kind of recurring responses where one request can result in multiple responses. For example the W3C Geolocation API provides a method called watchPosition. The method takes a position update listener as input argument that is called each time the position changes. Using JSON-RPC without additions would mean that the listener can only be called on time because afterwards the response message id would become invalid and the receiver of the response can delete the id from the stack of awaiting responses which would result in the inability to match additional responses to the desired listener.

In webinos platform it is allowed to use the ID of a request message as receiver selector for subsequent request messages that were made in response to the original request. This basically allows for a kind of subscribe scheme within JSON-RPC where answers to a specific JSON-RPC request are sent also as JSON-RPC request but including a specific selector that allows to choose the correct original requesting object that is interested in these answers. In this case IDs will be valid until either the subscription was canceled, for example depending on the involved API unsubscribe, clearWatch, removeEventListener or comparable things were called, or after the service was unbound or connection to the service was lost.

Following the approach is described using an example.

The method addEventListener is basically a function that just returns some data on a regular basis which can change over time but instead of doing it synchronous as direct result it does return results using a listener pattern. Thus, multiple results can be provided to a callback. The message below invokes the addEventListener function a "http://webinos.org/api/example" service. The function just takes a callback that is used to provide the results back to the caller, for example void addEventListener(EventListener callback).

On the client site the RPC implementation needs to record that calling addEventListener can return multiple responses as JSON-Request messages. Concrete the id of the JSON-Message ("2") must be used for all answers related to this callback registration.

RPC-Request for Listener pattern:

<pre class="javascript">
payload: Object
{
 id: "2"
 jsonrpc: "2.0"
 method: "http://webinos.org/api/test@6e6885b25a7ddb5f4658e7a599d1fc17.addEventListener"
 params: null
}
</pre>

RPC-Response as JSON-RPC Request message for listener pattern:

<pre class="javascript">
payload: Object
{
 jsonrpc: "2.0"
 method: "2.onEvent";
 params: {
 "msg":"example result"
 }
}
</pre>

<pre class="javascript">
payload: Object
{
 jsonrpc: "2.0"
 method: "2.onEvent";
 params: {
 "msg":"another example result"
 }
}
</pre>

The method for the callback (like onEvent) depends on the methods exposed by the callback object (here referenced with ID 2) on the requester side. Thus other methods may be callable too on the object while using the same id.

<pre class="javascript">
payload: Object
{
 jsonrpc: "2.0"
 method: "2.onAnotherFunction";
 params: {
 "result": {
 "atr1": 1
 "atr2": 2
 }
 }
}
</pre>

webinos RPC Responses
---------------------

Following an example response to the request made in the previous section, i.e, a positive result of invoking exampleFunction.

-   _jsonrpc_ is again the JSON-RPC version identifier that MUST be set to "2.0".
-   _id_ MUST match the provided RPC request id so that the response can be matched against requests being made previously.
-   _result_ is an object that contains any JSON structure and represents the result of the method invocation. In this case its just a String.

<pre class="javascript">
JSON
{
 jsonrpc: "2.0"
 id: "3"
 result: "22 something to echo"
}
</pre>

webinos RPC errors
------------------

In case of any errors occurred at the RPC server, either internal RPC errors like "method not found" or an error callback of an API, negative responses need to be created and sent back to the requester using following format that follows the JSON-RPC specification 2.0.

JSON Object containing the attributes

-   _jsonrpc_ with values "2.0"
-   _id_ which is the identifier of the corresponding request
-   _error_ which is an object describing the occurred error in more detail

The **error** attribute itself consists again of three attributes

-   _code_ which is either a RPC protocol specific code as defined in the JSON-RPC specification v2.0 (for example –32601 "Method not found") or the webinos specific error code –31000. Code –31000 must be used when an API specific error is provided as result of a method invocation. Basically if an API throws an Exception or returns with calling an error callback as defined in the API.
-   _message_ which is either a message related to the code field as specified in the JSON-RPC specification v2.0 or "Method Invocation returned with error" if code is set to –31000
-   _data_ which is an API specific error object that should be provided to the original API caller either by throwing an exception or be invoking a related error callback which is registered with the ID of the message.

An example for a webinos specific error is shown below. The data field contains a W3C DOMError, namely the "NotSupportedError" error, which should be forwarded to the original requester that may await either a success callback, error callback, or an exception to be thrown. The original requester from an API point of view will only receive the object stored in the data attribute as input of the error callback.

<pre class="javascript">
JSON
{
 jsonrpc: "2.0"
 id: "2"
 error = {
 data: "NotSupportedError",
 code: –31000,
 message: ‘Method Invocation returned with error’
 };
}
</pre>

Mapping JavaScript APIs to RPC messages
=======================================

For each JavaScript call a related RPC mapping must be defined to realize the RPC binding. In this section a general approach of mapping APIs to RPC messages is described that must be used if possible. For API functionalities where a mapping is not trivial and cannot be described in a generic way the differences respectively the full messages needed are documented.

Possible cases where a simple mapping cannot be given are:

-   Supporting functions where additional not directly JS API call related RPC messages will be defined where suitable. For example pre-fetching all static attributes of the Sensor API with one RPC message during binding to the service rather than using one synchronous message for each attribute when it is accessed. This for example allows much better bandwidth usage and response times for accessing just static attributes.
-   Since the used JSON-RPC protocol is a stateless protocol additional attributes may be needed by certain services to match client side and server side objects to be used for executing methods declared within the RPC messages. For example calls of the DeviceStatus API are more like atomic calls. On request is made and one result is provided, any state information is not needed. For other APIs kind of state information is needed, for example exactly on which File object a read/write operation should be performed? This information is not reflected in the JavaScript API (and must not) but it must be transmitted within the RPC messages.

Beside of the general descriptions of the mappings and concrete additional messages the end of this section lists two full examples, the Discovery API as well as the Generic Sensors API.

As described in the previous sections each RPC call comply to JSON-RPC 2.0. Some elements are set by a compliant JSON-RPC implementation itself, for example the ‘id’ and the ‘jsonrpc’ field, so that they are not listed again for each following example. Only the relevant parts of the messages are shown. The service instance identifier, as introduced in the previous section, is also abbreviated using following the term <instance>.

Mapping Function Calls
----------------------

### Invoking a Remote function

#### Mapping function names

The <function> field of the RPC message that represents the function invoked at the target service must be mapped like follows

<function> = <InterfaceName>.<functionName> where

-   <InterfaceName> is the name of the related JavaScript interface of the API
-   <functionName> is the name of the function that is called

**Example**

**WebIDL** _the launchApplication() function of the AppLauncherManager interface_

<pre class="javascript">
JSON: Object
{
 method: "http://webinos.org/api/applauncher@<instance>.AppLauncherManager.launchApplication"
}
</pre>

#### Mapping parameters

Input parameters of functions must be encoded in a JSON object which is assigned to the params field of the RPC message. The object must contain any parameter that are specified in the relating JavaScript API as mandatory while using the same parameter names as attribute names. Optional parameters can be omitted, success and error callbacks must be skipped because they are handled separately by the RPC protocol as described above.

**Example**

**WebIDL:** _void launchApplication(VoidFunction successCallback, ErrorCallback errorCallback, DOMString applicationID)_

<pre class="javascript">
JSON: Object
{
 method: "http://webinos.org/api/applauncher@<instance>.AppLauncherManager.launchApplication"
 params: {
 appURI: "http://www.example.org"
 }
}
</pre>

### Callbacks

Both error callbacks and success callbacks must contain exactly the data structure as defined in the related JavaScript API specifications in their respective data fields. For error callbacks the _data_ attribute of the _error_ field and for success callbacks the _result_ field.

**Example**

**WebIDL:** _callback AppInstalledCallback = void (boolean result);_

<pre class="javascript">
JSON
{
 result: result
}
</pre>

**WebIDL:** _callback ErrorCallback = void (DOMError error);_

<pre class="javascript">
JSON
{
 error = {
 data: error,
 };
}
</pre>

List of additions to general mappings
-------------------------------------

This subsection lists additions needed by some APIs which can not be reflected in general, for example for APIs where some state information is needed to match client and server side objects. webinos compliant RPC implementations must not rely on any other addition to the general mapping then the ones listed here.

### Service Discovery API

#### FindCallBack.onFound

In addition to the service attributes that must be provided according to the general mapping scheme on additional parameter is provided for internal use.

-   _serviceAddress_ which is the address of the PZP that hosts the found service. This parameter will be used in subsequent calls to the service so that RPC requests can be routed to the desired PZP and service endpoint.

The _serviceAddress_ must not be provided to application developers.

### File APIs

[[RPC_File_API]]

List of additional messages
---------------------------

This subsection lists additional RPC messages which are not directly related to the JavaScript API. For example for APIs where some static data can be fetched from the service side to the client side in order to reduce traffic and increase responsiveness when reading attributes or invoking functions. webinos compliant RPC implementations must not rely on any other additional RPC message then the ones listed here.

### Generic Sensor API

#### getStaticData function

This function is used to request the values of all static sensor specific attributes from the sensor so that they are directly available on the client side. Thus, it is not needed to have a separate messages to access these attributes. This message should be used during binding to the service. The attribute names are 1:1 mappings from the JS API specification. Namely these are:

-   maximumRange;
-   minDelay;
-   power;
-   resolution;
-   vendor;
-   version;

Request:

<pre class="javascript">
JSON:
{
 method: "http://webinos.org/api/sensors@<instance>.getStaticData"
 params: null
}
</pre>

Response:

<pre class="javascript">
JSON:
{
 result: {
 maximumRange = 100;
 minDelay = 10;
 power = 50;
 resolution = 0.05;
 vendor = "Example Vendor";
 version = "0.1";
 }
}
</pre>

### Generic Actuator API

#### getStaticData function

This function is used to request the values of all static actuator specific attributes from the actuator so that they are directly available on the client side. Thus, it is not needed to have a separate messages to access these attributes. This message should be used during binding to the service. The attribute names are 1:1 mappings from the JS API specification. Namely these are:

-   range;
-   unit;
-   vendor;
-   version;

Request:

<pre class="javascript">
JSON:
{
 method: "http://webinos.org/api/actuators@<instance>.getStaticData"
 params: null
}
</pre>

Response:

<pre class="javascript">
JSON:
{
 result: {
 range = [0,1];
 unit = ["OFF","ON"];
 vendor = "Example Vendor";
 version = "0.1";
 }
}
</pre>
