PZH
===

Webinos personal zone comprises of two entities, PZH and [[PZP]]. Entity is defined as PZH that can be reachable via devices in your personal zone and it could be either a cloud based service or could be integrated in DSL router. It should be reachable on public internet.

In client - server terminology, PZH acts as a server in a Webinos architecture. PZH is limited to just one user, i.e. Alice is a sole owner of PZH. If user wish to establish communication with other user, they securely exchange certificate and performing pairing between their zones.

PZH provides following functionality :

-   Default PZH
-   Creating PZH
-   Client and Server TLS connection
-   PZH/PZP Updates
-   [[Messaging and Routing]]
-   [[Synchronisation]]
-   [[Authentication]]
-   [[PZH Admin]]
-   "Certificate creation":http://dev.webinos.org/redmine/projects/wp3-3/wiki/Personal_Zone_Key_Infrastructure

In this document we refer to PZH as a single entity running on a server. In implementation to hold more than one PZH in a single instance of server, it can be created as a PZH farm and is covered in informative section, [[PZH deployment]]

In this section, we cover the first 4 functionality, rest of the remaining functionality are covered in other sections.

Default PZH
-----------

PZH by default should have a web server running all the time. This web server could be a https server or secure web socket server. It should facilitate following functionality:
* Login interface
* Adding/Remove device
* PZH migration
* Logging of events
* User/PZH Bind
* Synchornisation

PZH starting is referred to starting web server in a state of listening. PZH server should be a secure server as it is used in certificate exchange and login. In process of initialisation it generates a set of certificates as described in "PKI":http://dev.webinos.org/redmine/projects/wp3-3/wiki/Personal_Zone_Key_Infrastructure

If there are no registered, user using the web server interface login to their OpenId credential. Once successfully login via OpenId, a set of certificates are generated as described in "PKI":http://dev.webinos.org/redmine/projects/wp3-3/wiki/Personal_Zone_Key_Infrastructure. This is a one time activity that happens depending on provider rules. Authentication is done via OpenId provider and is covered in [[Authentication]]

In this document we do not specify how PZH provider provide services. It is assumed before providing login option, user has to select the service provider facilities.

Once user is authenticated to their PZH, user can select different services as covered in [[PZH Admin]].

PZH creation
------------

After user has successfully logged in via OpenId credentials, a PZH is created for the user. A typical process involved in PZH enrollment are:
* Certificate generation, a connection certificate.
* Initialization of PZH TLS Server using connection and master certificate.
* Storing certificate information about PZH.
* Storing services about the PZH host.

### PZH default policy

PZH once created should have general set of policies. Default policy each PZH should have are covered in [[Policy]]

### PZH Identity

An identity assigned to the PZH is fetched via OpenId credentials. An OpenId authentication returns attributes of values, the information that PZH stores are user’s first name, last name, country and email id. PZH identity could be first and last name of the user or if these fields are empty user email id can be used as a user identity.

### PZH Address

PZH once created should be reachable and this address should be enrolled with WebFinger server. This address should be reachable to user all the time when connected to the Internet. The address if of form URI and should be typically of form example.org/alice or alice.example.org.

Routing
-------

PZH provides routing between other PZH and between connected PZP. More information about PZH routing is covered in [[Messaging and Routing]]

Client and Server TLS connection
--------------------------------

PZPs and PZHs have the following client and server connections.

### TLS Servers on the PZH

| Port | |
| Description | Incoming connections from PZPs (zone devices) as well as connections from external (friend) PZHs. |
| Parameters | rejectUnauthorized = false, requestCert = true |
| Trusted certificates | PZP certificates & trusted external (connection) PZH certificates |
|/3. Authentication | Entities with self-signed certificates are assumed to be new PZPs. The enrolment process is documented in "PZH Admin":http://dev.webinos.org/redmine/projects/wp3-3/wiki/PZH_Admin section |
 | Entities with PZH certificates are assumed to be a device within that user’s PZH |
 | Entities with PZP certificates are assumed to be zone devices |

### Outgoing TLS connections on the PZH

| Port | |
| Description | Outgoing connections to other PZHs |
| Parameters | |
| Trusted certificates | Just the certificate of the PZH we are contacting. May not be entirely trusted |
|/2. Authentication | The remote party must use the certificate we are expecting |
 | Any incoming data from this connection must be mapped to the user of the PZH we are connecting to. They may not be trusted to do anything else. |

PZH/PZP Status Update
---------------------

PZH MUST maintain list of all PZP and PZH that are connected. This functionality is different from synchronisation, which is more about updating policies, certificates. It should also cover synchronisation update.

### PZP

PZP that has been generated certificate by PZH is hold in the trusted list of PZH.

Along with the name of PZP in trusted list, it also hold information about
* Online or offline status. (Please note online means connected to PZH.)
* IP Address
* Port (TLS Server running on PZP, details in [[PZP]] specification)
* Services running on PZP

These information is hold dynamically depending on PZP joining and leaving PZH. These details are useful for PZP to establish peer connection with other PZP directly and finding of service.

All these details except service information is exchanged with all connected PZP. This should be done to facilitate communication between PZP and update about their presence.

### PZH

Successful certificate exchange with other PZH as described in "PKI":http://dev.webinos.org/redmine/projects/wp3-3/wiki/Personal_Zone_Key_Infrastructure is hold in the trusted list. Connection with other PZH might be short term or long term depending on the user policy.

Along with the name of PZH in trusted list, it also hold information about
* Online or offline status. (Please note online means connected to PZH.)
* IP Address
* Services running inn the other personal zone
