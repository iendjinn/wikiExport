Webinos Application Specification Open Questions
================================================

-   Shall we support devices which providing no means for user interaction (e.g., an sensor where the user can install an application)?
    -   the device may be managed by another webinos device or it may has to provide a web interface for managing applications, however, it could also be up to the application developer since we have remote installation of packages anyway but how the security/policy framework manages such devices?
-   Some pre-defined events must be defined and how events can be referenced must be clarified
    -   Remote installation of applications (transport application in payload vs. communicate an URI for requesting the package vs. get an endpoint for pushing an application to another device)
    -   Its planned to allow applications to register for automatic execution based on events => how can events be referenced (e.g., boot-up-completed or application specific ones)
    -   Its planned to allow applications to expose their functions to other applications (locally and remotely accessible). Since it is a related problem the approach for accessing remote APIs must be clarified. This includes also how to discover a specific device / application that exposes functionalities and how to address these ones (application ID vs. instance ID) resp. how to establish communication (including streaming) between applications (e.g. via sockets).
    -   Its planned that a webinos runtime provides applications to the user which are accessible to him (e.g., hosted on another device, based on ownership or physical distance).
-   How the Policy Management and Security Framework is integrated in the WRE/Application specification is to be discussed (deliverable structure)
-   Do we have an external addressable interface to the webinos eventing system,e.g., in order to allow application stores or web sites to publish application update events?
