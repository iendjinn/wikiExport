UI Adaptation - State of The Art
================================

Introduction
------------

Before creating the UI adaptation specification, we performed a state of the art research to check for existing adaptation methods. At first we overruled possibility of server-side adaptation, as everything needs to happen client-side.
Following approches have been investigated:
* Additions to HTML tags / JS-based frameworks (e.g. jQuery mobile)
* User inteface markup languages (XUL)
* Other approaches (custom JS framework, Joshfire framework)

Next chapters describe the results of the research.

Model-based User Interfaces
---------------------------

Recent research on model driven engineering has been particularly active in the domain of user interface engineering [Desruelle et al. 2011]. The CAMELEON Reference Framework (CRF) defines an important foundation for this type of approaches [Calvary et al. 2003]. The framework specifies a context-sensitive user interface development process, driven by an intrinsic notion of the current user context, the environment context, as well as the platform context. According to the CRF approach, an application’s user interface development consists of multiple levels of abstraction. Starting from an abstract representation of the interface’s task and domain model, a PSM of the user interface is subsequently generated by means of a chained model transformations based on contextual knowledge. A number of languages have adopted CRF: UsiXML [Limbourg et al. 2004], useML [Meixner and Thiels 2008], and MARIA [Paterno et al. 2009]. Moreover, the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) charted the Model-Based UI Working Group (MBUI-WG) as part of its Ubiquitous Web Activity (UWA) to investigate the standardization of context-aware user interface authoring [Cantera 2010]. Its goal is to work on standards that enable the authoring of context-aware user interfaces for web applications. The MBUI-WG aims to achieve this type of adaptivity by means of a model driven design approach. In this context, the semantically structured aspects of HTML5 will be used as key delivery platform for the applications’ adaptive user interface.

### Abstraction Levels and Transformations

The CAMELEON Reference Framework relies on a model driven approach and structures the development of a user interface into four subsequent levels of abstration:

-   Specification of the **task and domain model**, defining a user’s required activities in order to reach his goals.
-   Definition of an **abstract user interface (AUI) model**. The AUI model defines a platform-independent model (PIM), which expresses the application’s interface independently from any interactors or modalities within the delivery context’s attributes.
-   Definition of a **concrete user interface (CUI) model**, a platform-specific model (PSM) which generates a more concrete description of the AUI by including specific dependencies and interactor types based on the delivery context.
-   Specification of the **final user interface (FUI)**, covering the code that corresponds with the user interface in its runtime environment (e.g., HTML, Java, etc.).

Figure 2 shows the interconnections and transformations between the above-mentioned CRF stages. The downward arrows depict reification processes. Reification is the transformation from a higher-level abstraction to a lower-level abstraction phase, hence inferring a more concrete UI description. The upward arrows, on the other hand, specify the abstraction processes. An abstraction is the inverse transformation of reification. The third transformation type is the translation, depicted by the horizontal arrows. The translation deals with adapting the UI description to changes in one of the context of use models. In this case, the UI description’s abstraction level remains the same when performing a translation.

### Adaptation Granularity and Approaches

The expected adaptability granularity has a major impact on a user interface’s engineering complexity. This property, e.g., indicates whether the defined adaptation process affects the entire UI, or only a contained number of identifiable sub-views. The Context-Aware Design Space (CADS), proposed by Vanderdonckt et al., can be utilized as a means to analyze and compare a software system’s dimensions subject to adaptation [Vanderdonckt et al. 2008]. As shown in Figure 3, the design space defines by default seven adaptation dimensions, but it can be extended with additional dimensions based on the application domain’s specific needs.

-   **Adaptation means:** denotes to which degree the adaptation should reconfigure the UI by inserting/deleting/modifying components, and whether it should also result in the re-allocation of UI components to different physical devices.
-   **UI Component granularity:** defines the smallest UI component unit that should be subjected to adaptation.
-   **State recovery:** characterizes the extent to which the state of performed adaptations can be transferred or recovered. This dimension ranges from transferring adaptation at the session level, to picking up the current task at the exact point in which it was stopped by enabling the recovery of individual actions.
-   **UI deployment:** defines whether decision regarding the deployment and adaptation of UI components is statically defined, or based on a more dynamic at-runtime model.
-   **Context coverage:** determines the UI’s expected degree of context awareness. This dimension denotes the UI’s adaptability in terms of the user’s specific characteristics, his device(s), and a description of their physical environment.
-   **Technological spaces:** documents the technological diversity that needs to be covered by the UI. This dimension defines whether the UI needs to cover one or more technoligical spaces (e.g., HTML, Qt, Tcl, AWT, Swing, etc.) and in case of a distributed UI, whether the allocated components cover different spaces.
-   **Meta-UI usage:** documents the existence of a meta-UI that enables control over the actual UI’s adaptation.

Figure 3

As documented by Schaefer, various approaches can be used to express the adaptation of a model-based user interface [Schaefer 2007]. In essence, three types of adaptation approaches can be distinguished: model-to-model transformations, transformations on the XML representation of models, and code transformations. The model-to-model approach relies on the fact that most MBUI models can be designed based on a directed graph structure. In result, adaptations between two models are specified with model mappings by means of graph transformation rules. As depicted in Figure 4, transformation rules consist of a Left Hand Side (LHS) condition matching the current UI model represented by graph G [Limbourgh et al. 2005]. To add expressiveness, one or more Negative Application Condition (NAC), which should not match G, can be defined. Based on the matching of these conditions a Right Hand Side (RHS) defines the transformation result by replacing LHS occurrence in G with RHS. This substitution operation results in an adapted UI model represented by graph G’.

![]({width:600px}http://desruelle.be/webinos/transformation.png)
Figure 4

Furthermore, for UI models represented with XML, XSLT transformations can be used as a more declarative way to define adaptations [Kay 2007]. The transformation process takes a XML based document as input together with an XSLT stylesheet module containing the transformation rules (see Figure 5). Each transformation rule consists of a matching pattern and an output template. Patterns to be matched in the input XML document are defined by a subset of the XPath language [Berglund et al. 2010]. The output after applying the appropriate transformations can be standard XML, but also other formats such as (X)HTML, XSL-FO, plain text, etc.

Declarative UI Description
--------------------------

A separate language would be introduced to describe components on a page; this language would then be interpreted during run-time by the app taking into consideration what the device is capable of and generating the required HTML/JS code. Typically a language of that kind is a XML dialect, but a there’s also a possibility to use for example JSON (see Clutter’s example here: http://docs.clutter-project.org/docs/clutter-cookbook/1.0/script-ui.html). The whole purpose of it would be to hide the specific implementations from the developer, so he could concentrate on the actual UI building. Main problem with this solution is the need to write our own interpeters, which not only adds overhead, but also takes more memory/disk space.

### XUL

XUL is a user interface markup language developed by Mozilla. Being a dialect of XML it is of course cross-platform.

**Features**:

-   Widgets and Controls:
    -   Box Model
    -   Buttons, Menus, Trees, Input boxes
    -   Content widgets - browser, iframe and editor
-   Templates - allow separation of data from the presentation layer via RDF datasource files
-   mature (over 10 years)
-   the XUL itself is easy to learn
-   ability to test the app without installing any additional software except for Firefox

JS-based framework
------------------

At first glance a pure HTML + JS solution seems like a perfect solution for modern devices (out-of-box support), given a closer inspection though many problems arise - the amount of webkit variants for the Android-based devices alone is overwhelming, as well as the distinct troubles they could give. And that’s just one family of products. That’s where the JS-based frameworks step in - usually an amalgam of pure HTML + it’s extensions (like "data-role" in JQuery Mobile) and components created by JavaScript (JoshFire Framework).

### "jQueryMobile":http://jquerymobile.com/

**Cross-platform & cross-device**: Instead of writing unique apps for each mobile device or OS, the jQuery mobile framework will allow you to design a single highly branded and customized web application that works on all platforms. It is feasible to use JQuery Framework since it supports iOS, Windows Phone, Android

**Touch-optimized layouts & UI widgets**: Dynamic touch interfaces that will adapt to a range of devices, the system will include both layouts (lists, detail panes, overlays) and a rich set of form controls and UI widgets (toggles, sliders, tabs).

**CSS framework**: To have the power to design full applications. support for more CSS3 properties.

**jQuery Mobile**: Touch-Optimized Web Framework for Smartphones & Tablets A unified user interface system across all popular mobile device platforms, Provides lightweight code that is built with progressive enhancement.
* jQuery Mobile event handling, Methods and Utilities, Data attribute reference and Theme Framework [1]
* jQuery Mobile UI - The UI is declared by using HTML 5 style "data-role". This makes the UI development a breeze. Building a prototype of jQuery Mobile UI (wireframe) would not require any coding, but just html tags.

**jQuery Mobile API**: Consists Page Loading, Transition, Dialog box handling, List View manipulation, item click and so on [2].

**Code Example**:

-   Include needed Javascript and CSS

<pre>
<head>

<link rel="stylesheet" href="/jquery.mobile-1.0a1.min.css" />
<script src="jquery-1.4.3.min.js"></script>
<script src="jquery.mobile-1.0a1.min.js"></script>

</head>
</pre>

-   Declare different Pages, Header and Navigation

<pre>
<body>

<div data-role="page" id="home">
 …..
 </div>

<div data-role="page" id="search">
 …..
 </div>

<div data-role="page" id="recent">
 …..
 </div>

</body>
</pre>

**jQuery mobile handling the Issues**:

-   Scrollbar issues - to start below header and end above footer [3]
-   Header and Footer issues to be fixed [3]

### "iUI - User Interface (UI) Framework for WebApp development":http://www.iui-js.org/

iUI is a framework consisting of a JavaScript library, CSS, and images for developing advanced mobile webapps. Made with only iPhone in mind in the first place (reason of i UI), now supports most smartphones & tablets.

**iUI has the following features**:

-   Create Navigational Menus and iPhone-style interfaces from standard HTML
-   Use or knowledge of JavaScript is not required to create modern mobile web pages
-   Ability to handle phone orientation changes
-   Provide a more "iPhone-like" experience in your Web apps

**Lightweight**:

iUI doesn’t come with dozens of transitions styles or hundreds of built-in UI elements like you can find in bigger frameworks like JQueryMobile or Sencha. And this is on purpose. Since iUI wants keep core code as lightweight as possible [4].

**HTML Markup**:

-   iUI is just plain HTML, CSS and Javascript.
-   No compilation, no code generation, no alteration [4].

### "qooxdoo Mobile":http://qooxdoo.org/

qx.Mobile is qooxdoo’s mobile framework. It provides specific UI classes for touch devices, handling of mobile events like swiping, and specific styling. It is suitable for various mobile web browsers on iOS and Android platforms.

**Features** [5]

-   Mobile widget set
-   Theming via CSS and LESS
-   iOS theme
-   Android theme
-   Touch events: touchstart, touchmove, touchend, touchcancel
-   Gesture events: swipe, tap
-   Animations between pages
-   Touch event emulation for debugging in desktop browsers
-   Fixed toolbars and momentum scrolling via iScroll
-   Basic PhoneGap support

**Development**:

**Mobile and tablet switch, Tablet support out of the box**: It provides a detection of device type the application runs on. Based upon this distinction the page manager navigation pages are optimized for device class mobile

**To get device type and enable device-based layouting**: The device type is accessible by the environment variable ‘device.type’

The device-based layouting is handled by qx.ui.mobile.page.Manager.

**Example**:

<pre>
var isTablet = false;
var manager = new qx.ui.mobile.page.Manager(isTablet);
var page = new qx.ui.mobile.page.NavigationPage();
manager.addDetail(page);
page.show();
</pre>

The manager has an optional constructor parameter isTablet. It indicates whether the page manager uses the mobile or the tablet layouting mode. In this examples, It shows the deactivated tablet layout mode with isTablet=false. If parameter isTablet is not defined at constructor, the page manager always calls environment variable device.type to determine the layout mode. Tablet layout mode is active by default, if environment variable is desktop or tablet [5].

**page manager arrange pages and layout modes**: There are 3 different layouting modes that ‘qx.ui.mobile.page.Manager’ offers [5].

-   Mobile Layout
-   Tablet Landscape Layout
-   Tablet Portrait Layout

**Example**:

<pre>
var manager = new qx.ui.mobile.page.Manager();

var masterPage = new qx.ui.mobile.page.NavigationPage();
var detailPage1 = new qx.ui.mobile.page.NavigationPage();
var detailPage2 = new qx.ui.mobile.page.NavigationPage();

manager.addMaster(masterPage);
manager.addDetail([detailPage1,detailPage2]);

masterPage.show();
detailPage1.show();
</pre>

**Theming**

-   CSS and LESS: Theming in qooxdoo mobile is done with LESS and CSS. LESS is an extension for CSS to enable style sheets to be more dynamic. In LESS you can you use variables, reuse CSS statement inside of CSS file, import CSS files and create mixins [5].

For example the LESS mixin for border-radius:

<pre>
.border-radius() {
 -webkit-border-radius: `arguments;
    -moz-border-radius: `arguments;
 border-radius: @arguments;
}
</pre>

This mixin helps you creating border-radius for most browsers, just by writing something like:

<pre>
.border-radius(4px);
</pre>

Conclusions
-----------

After the research the conclusion has been reached, that none of the existing adaptation methods will fully meet Webinos platform’s needs. Hence we decided to create our own, custom approach, which takes what we need from other methods.
Main assumptions for the new approach are:
* Based on existing frameworks (model-based and event-conditions-action rules)
* Making it flexible for developers and allow them freedom
* Still allowing developers to do everything in-app (e.g. with progressive enhancement) and disable all webinos adaptations
