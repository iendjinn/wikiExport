microPZP enrolment
==================

There no direct enrolment interaction between a microPZP and a PZH as there is for a PZP. Instead, a microPZP enrolls to a Personal Zone once enrolment credentials â€“ i.e. the microPZP key and certificate, and the PZH certificate â€“ have been obtained by an offline administrative process outside the scope of this specification.

With the credentials and PZH details, enrolment is a configuration step for the microPZP. If the microPZP supports remote administration, this can be performed through the admin API; otherwise it requires some local and proprietary action at the microPZP.

Under the admin API, a number of configuration elements are defined for such configuration; these mirror the default paths of the persisted data in the full PZP. The following configuration elements are defined.

|Configuration key| Meaning |Type and format|
|pzh| Relevant pzh details |String, containing JSON string representation of pzh.json|
|devicelist| Contains the list of known devices and users |String, containing JSON string representation of devicelist.json|
|policy.root| Contain the root security policy| Collection, containing policy rules as strings|
|policy.<other>| Scope for future expansion for supplementary policy fragments| |
|certificates.external| Contains certificates of known external peers| Collection, containing PEM-encoded certificate strings|
|certificates.internal.pzp.cert| Own PZP certificate |String, PEM-encoded certificate|
|certificates.internal.pzp.key| Own PZP private key |String, PEM-encoded key|
|certificates.internal.pzh.cert| Own PZH certificate| String, PEM-encoded certificate|
