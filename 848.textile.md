Extensions for webinos
----------------------

Extensions in webinos provides access to unique device features as stated in requirement CAP-DWB-FHG-002 and described in the use case WOS-UC-TA3-004 "Embedding Proprietary Extensions".

In order to enable third party developers to build and use extensions a sub system to handle extensions has to be established.

In the browser space there are several solutions available, which we can leverage from. However, there is a fine distinction between browser plug-ins (e.g., Adobe Flash) and extensions/add-ons (e.g., Firebug). Whereas plug-ins add support for alternative content types to the rendering engine (which can be embedded into a web application), extensions modify or add to existing functionality of the browser. From a generic stand point three distinctive parts have to be specified for the extension handling:
# Application APIs for accessing extensions inside a webinos application,
# Pre-defined interfaces for integrating the extension into the webinos runtime (e.g., initialize function of the extension, mapping of extension methods/attributes to JavaScript methods/attributes)
# Data scheme for providing metadata about the extension (e.g., name, supported platforms)

Furthermore we can distinguish extensions in webinos by its "user group". There are on the one hand platform specific extensions, which are available to all applications executed on the device and on the other hand there are extensions which can be coupled to a specific application.

The platform specific model is used in the general browser plug-in concept. Once the plug-in is installed on the device, the plug-in will be used by all web application, which embeds an object mapped to the specific MIME-Type of the plug-in.

The concept of application specific extensions has been applied in HP webOS Plug-in Development Kit (PDK) [HP-PDK]. A similar approach can be found in Chrome extensions, where an extension can embed a NPAPI plug-in [Chrome-NPAPI].

### State-of-the-Art extensions and plug-ins in the browser environment

In the state-of-art analysis we are going to evaluate different solutions for extensions in webinos such as browser-plug-in (NPAPI), browser extensions (Chrome extensions) and JavaScript engine add-ons and provide a recommendation, which solution shall be incorporated into the webinos runtime.

#### Plug-in standards

The Netscape Plug-in API (NPAPI) has been adopted by all major browser platforms ranging from Webkit browsers (Safari, Chrome) to Firefox and Opera. MS Internet Explorer does not support NPAPI in favour of ActiveX.

Plug-in are executed directly on the underlying operating system. NPAPI plug-in are browser independent but heavily rely on the operating systems especially for 2D and 3D graphical output or audio output. For each operating system the plug-in needs to be customized and compiled. However, there are a few frameworks such as [FireBreath] or [Luce] available for simplifying the cross-platform development of NPAPI plug-ins.

In order to provide a richer interaction between a web application and a NPAPI plug-in, the NPAPI addition "npruntime" was introduced. npruntime has been adopted by all major platforms as well. [npruntime]

Google proposed an extension to NPAPI called PEPPER (or PPAPI) to reduce the dependencies between the plug-in and the operating system. Currently PPAPI is only supported by Chrome [PPAPI]. Mozilla stated that they are not interested in working on PPAPI at the moment [moz-ppapi].

The unlimited and direct access to the operating system for plug-ins raises many security considerations, but is nevertheless an important factor to build unique web applications and enabling the access to unique device features. To overcome the security concerns about NPAPI Google introduced the Google Native Client project (NaCl) to execute native code in a sandboxed environment and prohibits the access to all hardware resources (e.g. file-system).

Due to the lack of support for PEPPER in different browser runtime and the limited usability of NaCl we are going to focus our analysis on plug-ins on NPAPI.

##### Using a NPAPI plug-in

From web application developerâ€™s perspective the usage of a plug-in is fairly simple. The following lines of code describe, how an app developer checks, if a plug-in for given MIME-Type is already installed on the device and how the web application can interact with the plug-in afterwards.

<pre>
<code class="Javascript">
if (navigator.mimeTypes["application/webinos-extension-x1"] &&
 navigator.mimeTypes["application/webinos-extension-x1"].enabledPlugin != null){
 document.write(‘<embed type="application/webinos-extension-x1">’);
 var embed = document.embeds[0];
 embed.nativeMethod();
 alert(embed.nativeProperty);
 embed.nativeProperty.anotherNativeMethod();
}
</code>
</pre>

##### Building a NPAPI plug-in

The NPAPI standard mandates the developer to embed methods inside the plug-in for interaction with the browser, as described in the following document [npapi-plugin-side-api]. These methods include the initialization (`NP_Initialize`), terminiation (`NPP_Destroy`) of the plug-in as well as receiving information about the supported MIME-Types (`NP_GetMIMEDescription`) and version of the plug-in (`NPP_GetValue`). `NPP_GetValue` also provides mechanism to handle requests from the web application.

As described in [npapi-browser-side-api] and [npruntime] the browser itself have to embed several methods in order to support NPAPI plug-ins. The API exposed by the browser to plug-in incorporates methods to invoke JavaScript functions of a web application (`NPN_Invoke`), to allocate memory of the browser mem space (`NPN_MemAlloc`) or to receive information about the browser engine (`NPN_GetValue`).

#### Extensions

There are no cross-browser extension standards available. Each browser engine provides a different set of functionality for its extensions.

Firefox provides for their add-ons a nice interface called js-cytpes to invoke native libraries without the need to integrate an extensions into Mozilla’s XPCOM architecture. The js-ctypes is detailed in the following section. The interaction possibility between a web application and the extension are fairly limited and is possible using events.

Extensions in Chrome are a zipped bundle of files (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, images). Extensions are essentially web pages with access to all the APIs that the browser provides to web pages. They can interact with web pages or servers using content scripts or cross-origin XMLHttpRequests. Additionally extensions can also interact programmatically with browser features such as bookmarks and tabs.

However, there are no direct mechanisms available for extensions to call JavaScript functions of a web page or vice versa. JS functions can be invoked using DOM manipulation.

Although there is no API provided to interact with the underlying operating system, NPAPI plug-ins can be part of zipped bundle.

A prototype chrome extensions for webinos built with the webinos discovery plug-ins underlines the weakness in communicating between the web-app and the extension.

#### Direct JavaScript additions

The JavaScript engine plays a crucial role in the webinos runtime. For that we are going to analyze two projects, which propose methods to access the native functions outside of the JavaScript engine. These two projects are add-ons in Node.js [node.js] and as already mentioned js-ctypes for Firefox extensions [js-ctypes].

#### js-cytpes

js-cytpes is an interface for add-ons in firefox running inside the chrome. The add-on cannot interact with scripts of a web application.
js-ctypes is a slim interface to call native libraries stored on the hosting device. It enables the access to these libraries, but does not provide any methods to store or install platform specific binaries. The following code snippet illustrates how js-cytpes can be used by a developer to open the native message box on a Windows system.

<pre>
<code class="Javascript">
/* importing the js-ctype library **/
Components.utils.import("resource://gre/modules/ctypes.json");
/** TODO **/
var lib = ctypes.open("C:WINDOWSsystem32user32.dll");
/** Declare the signature of the function we are going to call **/
var msgBox = lib.declare("MessageBoxW", ctypes.winapi_abi, ctypes.int32_t, ctypes.int32_t,ctypes.jschar.ptr, ctypes.jschar.ptr,ctypes.int32_t);
var MB_OK = 3;
/** triggering the previous declared function*/
var ret = msgBox(0, "Hello world", "title", MB_OK);
lib.close();
</code>
</pre>

#### node.js addons

Node.js is a server-side JavaScript environment that uses an asynchronous event-driven model. It is based on Google’s JavaScript engine V8. Add-ons for node.js are dynamically linked shared objects and provide glue to C and C++ libraries [node.js].

From an application developer perspective the usage of an add-on in Node.js is straight forward as illustrated in the following code snippet.

<pre>
<code class="Javascript">
var extension = require(./extension);
extension.doSomething();
</code>
</pre>

The development of an add-on in node.js involves knowledge of numerous libraries:
# V8 JavaScript library for creating objects, calling functions etc
# libev, a C event loop library, if there is need to wait for a file descriptor to become readable, wait for a timer, or wait for a signal to received one will need to interface with libev. That is, if you perform any I/O, libev will need to be used. Node uses the EV_DEFAULT event loop.
# libeio, a C thread pool library for executing blocking POSIX system calls asynchronously.

All Node add-ons must export a function called `init` with the following signature:

<pre>
<code class="C">
extern ‘C’ void init (Handle<Object> target)
</code>
</pre>

### Mapping requirements to technical solutions and Recommendation for the webinos runtime

Table X compares the different solutions with the relevant requirement developed in work package 2. The table provides an overview how the different solutions fulfil the relevant requirements.

||**NPAPI**|**js-ctypes**|**Node.js Add-ons**|
| (CAP-DWB-FHG-002) The webinos runtime SHOULD allow access to non-webinos APIs to device features| Designed to add support for additional MIME-types for the rendering engine. Plug-in is executed on the OS level. It supports graphical output inside a web-application. | Enables the developer to call native libraries within JavaScript. No graphical output inside the web-application supported. | Enables the developer to execute native code on the OS level. (Add-on is statically linked). No graphic output inside the web-application possible.|
|(PS-DWP-ISMB-202) The Webinos runtime MUST ensure that an application does not access device features, extensions and content other than those associated to it. | Not supported. Mechanisms for (dis)allowing to load plug-in needs to be integrated | Not supported. Mechanisms need to be integrated | Not supported. Mechanisms need to be integrated|
|(CAP-DEV-FHG-100) Access to resource on remote devices SHALL be available | Not supported. Addition would be required. Hard to enable since NPAPI is tightly coupled to the web application DOM events. What about the graphical output? What about the graphical output, when remotely accessed?| Not supported | Partially supported. Server module of Node.js could be used to make extensions remotely available. Middleware for exposing the data needs to be developed.|
|It SHALL be possible to define meta-packages containing a collection of applications and/or extensions. | Partially fulfilled. For application specific extensions, the plug-in is part of the application package and could be described in the packages/application manifest| Not integrated in the system yet| Not supported |
|Extensions SHALL be packaged in a way that is as similar as possible to applications.| NPAPI is one binary file. Meta data about a NPAPI plug-in such as name, version, description is stored in the binary itself.| No package system defined| Each node.js add-on is described by a manifest file in JSON syntax. Add-ons are not packaged, but are stored in a separate folder|
|Extensions SHALL be treated in a way that is similar and consistent with standard device features.| Partially fulfilled: Plug-in is embedded object in HTML and provides a scriptable interface. | |Extension API is used in the same way as the regular APIs|
|An Extension that contains platform-specific code MUST be associated with the supported platform(s).| Must be specified in the metadata description of the application| JavaScript code is OS specific. Platform association needs to be integrated | Must be specified in the metadata description of the application|

For local usage a solution based on NPAPI is the most compelling one. It’s widely supported in browser runtimes and supports graphical output on the device. The graphical output could be relevant for games (one of the reasons, why HP/Palm introduced the webOS PDK). A remote access to a NPAPI plug-in could be achieved, but would be limited to its scripting interface.
