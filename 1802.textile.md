Webinos authentication table
============================

There’s something a bit weird about separating hardware, software and then "platform". But sometimes you do make the distinction.

Identities
----------

### Users

* Email addresses
 * URIs for OpenID
 * Face
 * Name
 * Third party-issued identity (e.g. social security number)
 * IMSI number?

Are we interested in discussing non-digital identifiers? Maybe we should restrict to digital or "digitalizable" entities (e.g. the digital content extracted by some biometric human peculiarities, like face or fingerprint, that can unambiguously identify a human being also in the digital world).

Maybe interesting some thoughts on usability of identifiers (e.g. is it simple to adopt by the user? Is it clear what represent? Is it hard to misuse/leak? Is it hard to be lost? …)
I tried to dig a little if there is literature on that, but no significant result at the moment, only best practice for authentication means associated to identifier, e.g. how to choose a password, sometimes with different/contradictory advices on the base of what’s the focus, if security or usability.

Some "here":http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.89.6079&rep=rep1&type=pdf, Identification and authentication are very similar concepts, the difference there is mainly that authentication is related to access, identification is just to identify an entity, regardless the purpose. This imply identification does not require proofs, just unambiguity.
Methods of identification are biometric or behavioral features, username, numeric IDs, possession of physical tokens.

### Platforms

* Possession of a token or key
 * Hardware + Software identity
 * Address - IP address.

### Software

* Hash of the software
 * Name + version of the software

### Hardware

* MAC Address
 * Identity key - AIK/EK Public in TPM
 * IMEI number
 * Hard drive identity

Authenticating users to a platform
----------------------------------

How does a platform authenticate a user?

-   User accounts. Require the user to "log in" based on a pre-shared pasword.
-   Through a third party identity provider. Require the user state their identity, verify this with a third party IdP, then request reverification
-   Possession or proximity to the platform.
-   Possession of a physical token
-   Biometrics

With webinos?

-   PZH authenticates the user through a third party IdP.
-   PZP authenticates the user through the device’s own mechanism, this may be a user account, or possession, or anything else.

Authenticating platforms to a user
----------------------------------

How does the user know they are talking to a particular platform

-   Through physical security of the platform - I keep my phone in my pocket, or my car locked in my garage.
-   Through the platform presenting a shared secret or picture. This is different from the user->platform model, as this shared secret or picture can’t _necessarily_ be processed by the user. If it does require some processing (e.g. verifying a signature) then this means that the user is delegating authentication to a device, which is then doing device<->device authentication, or device-assisted user<->device authentication.
    -   Example: TLS Certificates + URL. The user verifies the URL, the local platform verifies the certificate. In theory, the user also verifies the root CAs, although this is also delegated to the platform.

With webinos?

-   TLS + Certificates for remote platforms
-   Possession or physical security

Authenticating platforms to other platforms
-------------------------------------------

How does one platform authenticate another?

-   TLS Certificates and pre-defined, mutually-trusted roots.
-   Shared secret keys or tokens
-   Through an out-of-band channel and another process, such as a barcode or PIN display + user.

With webinos?

-   TLS certificates + mutually trusted roots

Authenticating users to other users
-----------------------------------

How does one user authenticate another?

-   Facial recognition
-   Vocal recognition
-   Possessing a physical credential, such as an ID card.
-   Friend-of-a-friend systems, where a user authenticates the other by checking that they are friends with the right people.
    -   This is related to a reputation or third-party system
-   Delegated to a device
    -   One user authenticates another through relying on that user authenticating to a trusted platform (e.g. a social network)

With webinos?

-   Currently undefined
-   Hopefully through social networks

Authenticating hardware to software
-----------------------------------

How does software authenticate the hardware it is using?

-   Keys stored in hardware and provisioned by the manufacturer
-   Software requesting a hardware identifier, such as a MAC address or an attestation key
-   Performance measurements

With webinos?

-   Not provided, yet.
-   Would be nice to add hardware identities to the PZP’s software identity, to identify the whole platform.

Authenticating software to hardware
-----------------------------------

How does hardware know what software is running?

-   Integrity measurement can establish the hash of running software, which combined with a reference measurement can be used for authentication. Hardware relies on software to do anything with this.

Authenticating software to software
-----------------------------------

How does one piece of software authenticate another

-   MACs/Certificates for the software, plus authenticated transport sessions provided by a higher-level authority. E.g. and operating system or a certificate authority + DNS.
-   Similarly, if software is assumed to have secure storage, software can hold a token or key.

How are we doing it in webinos?

-   Applications are authenticated through their certificate + signature, with webinos providing the authority for the identity
    -   Users are expected to verify URLs

Authenticating users to software
--------------------------------

-   See "Authenticating users to platforms"

Authenticating software to users
--------------------------------

-   Supply-chain - the software comes in a shiny box, or comes pre-installed
-   A certificate is verified for the software, by the platform. Again, this is delegated to the user. The user takes part by verifying the URI associated with the certificate (E.g. the name of the manufacturer or app id)

How are we doing it in webinos?

-   Applications are authenticated through their certificate + signature, with webinos providing the authority for the identity
    -   Users are expected to verify URLs
