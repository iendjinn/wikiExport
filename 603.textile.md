INTRODUCTION AND PACKAGE DESCRIPTION
====================================

This toolchain is intended to create a whole set of API specifications based in static HTML content and WebIDL annotated files.

All the sources for the generation should be available in a folder in which three sub-folders should be available:

* static: Where the static html, js or css files that compose the spec are stored.
 * widl: Where the annotated WebIDLs are stored.
 * resources: That contains the following files:
 **** widlproc: The widlproc executable (compiled for Linux) that translates widls into xmls.
 **** widlprocxml.dtd: The DTD with the definition of the widl to xml translation.
 **** widlprocxmltohtml.xsl: An XSL to convert the XML generated from the widl to html.

RUNNING THE TOOL
================

The tool is executed through the webinos.sh script that converts all the widls in the widl folder to htmls and copies them to a folder in which all the static resources (static folder) are also copied to. Right now the script is a bash shell script so you will need to install "Cygwin":http://www.cygwin.com/ on Windows to execute it.

In order to execute it the following steps must be followed:

1) Execute the script webinos.sh with two input arguments:

## The folder in which all the sources are included (according to the structure defined in the previous section)
 ## An existing folder in which a folder called apis will be generated in order to include all the specification there.

For instance, if the content of the zip file has been extracted in the /tmp folder, the command webinos.sh /tmp/sources /tmp/spec should generate the spec at /tmp/spec/apis.

Example:
<pre>
$ ./webinos.sh sources/ spec/
</pre>

WebIDL format:
==============

The tool is based on the widlproc tool http://widl.webvm.net/ which has extensive documentation about how should it be used and what is the format of the widl files to be processed.

Customizing the tool:
=====================

The look&feel of the output is quite flexible and can be easily customized through the XSL file available in resources folder and the CSS available in the static folder.
