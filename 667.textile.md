TV and STB control API ("Task 166":http://79.125.104.127/redmine/issues/166)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A TVMediaElement interface, that inherits from and extends the HTMLMediaElement, to support TV video broadcast streams which are mapped as channels, is specified. The API supports listing, setting and switching these channels.

All to review and prepare for discussion in Berlin.

Bar code reading.
-----------------

The proposed conclusion is a JavaScript port of the ZXing Java library. This was accepted by the meeting and means that bar code reading is out of scope for WP 3.2.

Generic sensor API.
-------------------

See proposed API by Claes, "SensorAPI.widl":http://79.125.104.127/redmine/attachments/506/GenericSensorAPI.widl and notes at "Task 164":http://79.125.104.127/redmine/issues/164

A new DOM 3 event is proposed. The proposal is inspired by W3C DeviceOrientation event, Battery Stataus event and the Android sensor API. Note that this needs to be complemented by some kind of sensor discovery mechanism. To be reviewed by all and discussed in Berlin.

Vehicle API
-----------

See "Vehicle API wiki":http://79.125.104.127/redmine/projects/t3-2/wiki/Vehicle_API. At this page Simon has stated vehuicle data to be exposed by the API and there is a proposal for an event based API a la DeviceOrientation and Battery status events. Simon stated that an event based approach may not be the best solution for vehicle data as the browser may be flooded with events and will make an alternative proposal.

Payment API
-----------

Christian stated that it is not yet decided if we need a payment API. This is to be discussed in Berlin and a decision has to be taken.
