Design decisions.
-----------------

Security Principles.
--------------------

From "Simson Garfinkel’s thesis":http://simson.net/thesis/dpat.pdf , the following security patterns seem relevant. If we can highlight anywhere example of following any of these principles, that would be valuable.

-   _Good Security Now (Donâ€™t Wait for Perfect)_. Ensure that systems offering some security features are deployed now, rather than leaving these systems sitting on the shelf while researchers try to develop â€œperfectâ€ security systems for deployment later
-   _Provide Standardized Security Policies (No Policy Kit)_. Provide a small number of standardized security conï¬gurations that can be audited, documented, and
    taught to users.
-   _Least Surprise / Least Astonishment_. Ensure that the system acts in accordance with the userâ€™s expectations.
-   _Explicit User Audit_. Allow the user to inspect all user-generated information stored in the system to see if information is present and verify that it is accurate. There should be no hidden data.
-   _Explicit Item Delete_. Give the user a way to delete what is shown, where it is shown.
-   _Reset to Installation_. Provide a means for removing all personal or private information associated with an application or operating system in a single, conï¬rmed, and ideally delayed operation
-   _Complete Delete_. Ensure that when the user deletes the visible representation of something, the hidden representations are deleted as well
-   _Leverage Existing Identiï¬cation_. Use existing identiï¬cation schemes, rather than trying to create new ones.
-   _Create Keys When Needed_. Ensure that cryptographic protocols that can use keys will have access to keys, even if those keys were not signed by the private key of a well-known Certiï¬cate Authority
-   _Track Received Key_. Make it possible for the user to know if this is the ï¬rst time that a key has been received, if the key has been used just a few times, or if it is used frequently.
-   _Migrate and Backup Key_. Prevent users from losing their valuable secret keys.
-   _Disclose Signiï¬cant Deviations_. Inform the user when an object (software or physical) is likely to behave in a manner that is signiï¬cantly different than expected. Ideally the disclosure should be made by the objectâ€™s creator.
-   (Questionable) _Install Before Execute_. Ensure that programs cannot run unless they have been properly installed.
-   _Distinguish Between Run and Open_. Distinguish the act of running a program from the opening of a data ï¬le.
-   _Disable by Default_. Ensure that systems does not enable services, servers, and other signiï¬cant but potentially surprising and security-relevant functionality unless there is a need to do so.
-   _Warn When Unsafe_. Periodically warn of unsafe conï¬gurations or actions. It is important to limit the frequency of warnings so that the user does not become habituated to them.
-   _Distinguish Security Levels_. Give the user a simple way to distinguish between similar operations that are more-secure and less-secure. The visual indications should be consistent across products, packages and vendors.

Some general principles (many taken from "Saltzer and Schroeder":http://www.cs.virginia.edu/~evans/cs551/saltzer/ :

-   _Economy of mechanism_: Keep the design as simple and small as possible. Prefer the most simple option available during design.
-   _Fail-safe defaults_: Base access decisions on permission rather than exclusion.
-   _Least privilege_: Every program and every user of the system should operate using the least set of privileges necessary to complete the job. This is often not possible, but is particularly relevant when designing components which are large enough to be considered potentially untrustworthy. E.g. a browser. They should be given the minimum privilege possible so that compromise has the least impact.
-   _Compromise recording_: It is sometimes suggested that mechanisms that reliably record that a compromise of information has occurred can be used in place of more elaborate mechanisms that completely prevent loss
-   Don’t reinvent the wheel: use existing technology where possible
-   Reduce the number and size of trusted components
-   Isolate individual components where possible

"Privacy Pitfalls":http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1037311 - 5 things to avoid:

-   obscuring potential information flow
-   obscuring actual information flow
-   emphasizing configuration over action
-   lacking coarse-grained control
-   inhibiting existing practice
