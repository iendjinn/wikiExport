microPZP Discovery
==================

TLS-capable microPZP
--------------------

For a TLS-capable microPZP, PZP Discovery is fundamentally unchanged in comparison with a full PZP. If a microPZP is attached via a bus and gateway, a bus-specific method may be used for peer PZP discovery; for example Bluetooth PZP discovery may be used, as with a full PZP, if the microPZP is attached over a BT PAN connection.

Tethered microPZP
-----------------

For a tethered microPZP, PZP Discovery is always mediated by the proxy device. This includes advertising the existence of already-enrolled microPZPs as well as conduct of any available method for discovery of as-yet-unenrolled microPZPs.

Bus-based discovery with auto-enrolment
---------------------------------------

If a microPZP is reachable via a bus that itself supports a local discovery mechanism (such as Bluetooth), then it is possible for the proxy device to manage a dynamic population of microPZPs automatically. The proxy can discover devices matching specific configured criteria â€“ by defining application-specific (and bus-specific) service identifiers if necessary â€“ and then configure and enroll those devices that are not already enrolled as they are discovered. This could be applicable in an IOT setting where there is a dynamic population of similarly configured devices.
