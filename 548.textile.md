Conference Call 25th March 2011
===============================

Agenda
------

### Current Status

-   3.1 has begun to make decisions and produce plans and output, there is plenty of material now on the wiki

* In 3.5 we’ve been quiet, but there is a structure for the deliverable and we’re beginning to see some of the issues
 * It is now time to crack on with outlining the security architecture
 * We don’t have that much time: less than a month of real time before the May meeting, then another month before we need to have something ready to review and edit.

-   I am aware of the following activities which definitely need to be reflected in the Security Architecture

* Policy Management
 * User management
 * Security APIs

-   However, there are equally important security issues occurring in all the different sections of 3.1 and 3.2, and our challenge is to keep track of them and make sure they remain consistent.

### Plans and work allocation

-   We need to take out inputs: the requirements, 3.1, 2.7 and identify the key security concerns.

* I propose doing this by [[Links_To_Tasks|mirroring the 3.1 work]] and extracting relevent requirements, threats / risks, and mitigations
 * This is easily done in parallel: Each partner is responsible for the areas they are working on
 * This should compliment work on 2.8 - the asset modelling. We’re looking top-down, while 2.8 works bottom-up. Output from 2.8 should help us prioritise later on.
 * On this page I would like to see:

* a list of all the assets and components (e.g. logical parts of webinos) currently present in this area. This might be drawn from the "Environment Models in T2.7":http://dev.webinos.org/redmine/projects/wp2-7/wiki/COU_Environments
 * a list of the known security _and privacy_ concerns. E.g. "avoid unauthorised access to private data when doing X, Y or Z", "require user authentication"
 * a list of mitigations / strategies for avoiding problems. E.g. "Using a transport session", etc.
 * a list of "requirements":http://dev.webinos.org/redmine/projects/wp2-2/wiki relevent to this area
 * a list of missing requirements
 * Examples of any security policies required (or being specified)

-   We can then work on producing a first iteration of this deliverable before the WP3 meeting at the beginning of May. Therefore, I would like this work completed by the 11th April.
-   I hope to condense and summarise the main results and put them into the [[Scope_Discussion]]
-   _agenda item_: allocation of effort to this work initially. See [[Links_To_Tasks]] page.
-   Separately to this, we (Oxford, Polito?, those with more effort?) will be looking at issues that do not map obviously to 3.1 areas.

### Other issues

-   Issue raised by Sven: "specific privacy and security requirements on identity issues":http://dev.webinos.org/redmine/boards/7/topics/13?r=16#message-16
-   Issue raised by Cesare: "Privileged applications":http://dev.webinos.org/redmine/boards/7/topics/13?r=19#message-19
-   Authentication mechanisms: update from the IDM group, but further thoughts on how to manage multiple identity systems, multi-factor authentication, etc, would be beneficial.

* _agenda item_: can someone take this on?

-   Inter-process communication and access control. How do applications on the **same** device communicate, and how do we specify permissions? Improvements on the Android model sought.
-   Intercept points in the policy architecture
-   Privacy issues - evaluation work needed.
-   Structure and isolation of webinos applications - creation of a "secure execution model"

* _agenda item_: Oxford quite happy to look into this, but will depend on platform assumptions (e.g. the OS we’re supporting, etc). Can anyone else be involved?

-   Thought to keep in mind: we have the opportunity to ask T2.7 to do an experiment for us on security and privacy expectations. If one springs to mind, let me know.
-   Draft deliverable structure - feedback? Volunteers needed to have a look and even start filling in the [[Deliverable_Outline|deliverable template]]. Cloud security models in particular?

* _agenda item_: can I have an action on someone to have a look at this?

-   Regular conference calls on T3.5: how often and when?

### Deadlines

-   Work described above: 11th April
-   First deliverable iteration: 20th April

Minutes
-------

### Attendance

John Lyle, Oxford
Nick Allott
Simon, BMW
Sven, DOCOMO
Andrea, Polito
Hans, Ambiesense
Ziran, Samsung

### Actions

* _All 3.5 partners_ to extra security issues from 3.1 and 3.2 areas to the [[Links_To_Tasks]] page
 * Andrea (and possibly Sven) to have a look at the OWASP threats and create a page on our current solutions to them
 * Nick to spend some time looking at how we can specify policies for company data and work/personal interaction - Might be worth doing so on this "Policy Management page":http://dev.webinos.org/redmine/projects/wp3-1/wiki/Policy_Elements
 * John to get in touch with Sony Ericsson, W3C and TIS
 * John to look into secure execution environment and isolation, possibly with help from Sony Ericsson. Plan to clearly identify layers and make recommendations.

Unassigned:

* Looking into inter-application communication and policies, plus links to the events area
 * Example privileged application policies
