**Item1.1: Identify Concepts and (initial) attributes in the context model**
GeorgeV/GeorgeG: To provide an Analytics Framework that can work side-by-side with context awareness we need to sort-out two things:
define the level of detail of the required (to be captured information) for analytics to work
define the frequency of collection of such information and the collection mechanism

*GeorgeV: An additionall architecture to context awareness needs to be proposed for collecting Analytics Data (by Friday May 27th)*

Christian: we need to be able to represent within webinos the information about the Userâ€™s social connections (i.e. in an online social network) YET we should opt for a solution that will not duplicate the data (relationships) that the user has in online platforms

John: by default Apps will not be given access to â€œanythingâ€. Probably upon installation time they will ask the User for the right permission to use specific information. In particular when a User is not logged into his Personl Zone by default he does not give away anything

GeorgeG: Do we have a list of permissions already defined???

John: Currenlty we have not any permissions defined. It is a good opportunity to start doing it within the Context Awareness part. We need to keep in mind that in different situations users with to associate themselve with different identities (i.e. at work use my linked in profile at home my facebook profile)

John: Default policies in WAC - low down the page - http://public.wholesaleappcommunity.com/redmine/embedded/wac2pubrev/core/widget-security-privacy.html

*GeorgeG: NTUA will contribute in defining permissions*.

Heiko: Are we planning to combine objects/attributes at a higher level to assist functions such as proximity or others?

GeorgeG: for the moment we do not have such an approach but we could examine such possiblities when we have an analytic list of the context objects. *we will provide this within the next week by Friday May 20th.*

Grzeq: we could make some structuralized information - i.e. location-street-citgy - but be carefull to combine information that represent true items in a meaningful way.

Ronny (later on a phonecall with GeorgeG): we should design a URI structurte in order to point to external user profiles in social networking platforms. then we canl supplement the User profile in webinos by adding a â€œrelationships []â€.

**Item1.2: Define the Form and Representation of the context model**
Hans: our view is to have context models or representations for each applications. Each application can define/use its own model. Each objects have a list of attributes and all attributes should be under a namespace, we need to discuss what the form of this namespace should be?

GeorgeG: can we setup a different page about what we do in Form and Representation of the Context model

Hans: OK

Hans: instead of returning a JSON string we could return a serializable object (i.e. a photo).

GeorgeG: JSON was chosen as a form to return descriptors of information (i.e. the URI of a photo object (Heiko)) but also to have a common format across webinos platform (referencing NAllot).

Hans: for computational purposes we could examine having a context object which is then represented in JSON.

Heiko: Agree with JSON representation

GeorgeG: *Hans to create new page linked from Item 1.2 (Define the Form and representation of context model) and put his research there for everybody to see and contribute.*

**Item1.3 Define the Storage and Extensibility Framework**
Heiko: we are currently looking at things such as couch DB and approaches of retrieving data form Android Devices and synchronising them up in the cloud. The list also contains more things i.e. graphDB Neo4J.

Dietter: As the list in 1.1 become richer we can use this as a basis.

GeorgeG: I will do some research on defining access Policy.

Hans: could you talk a bit more aobut the differences of couch DB vs. SQL.

Dietter: it is document base and supports JSON.

Hans: Scalability can be an issue

George: Several various database technologies were already discussed, but no decission was done.

George: Scalability is very important and needs to be deeply discussed.

Dieter: Scalability should not be the main driver of the architectural approach.

George: Agree, but scalability cannot be left off. The more scalable solution we have, the better.

Hans: Did you do any research on synchronization of couch DB?

Heiko: Not yet. We need some time to check it.

Dieter: The synchronization mechanism will have to very sophisticated. Sometimes user does not want specific information to be stored on device. Synchronization will be supported on level of PZ and PZH

Dieter: *Letâ€™s create WIKI page with all details and solution comparison to help us decide what to choose.*
