‘Privilege Apps and Services Usecases Requirements Sequence Diagram’
====================================================================

Conf Call (18/4/11):
--------------------

### Action Points:

1.) Result from "Privileged Apps and Services" was that we will be merging Privileged Apps and Services with Policy Management.
2.) It will be a Sub Task now in the Policy Management.
3.) Considering Policy management from the perspective of an User, Operator or Device manufacturer. We need to consider how authorities and certificate hierarchies will work.
4.) Bring in some data from Content Adaption and Content Awareness, Extension Handling, Cross Domain Platforms with Privileged Apps and Services.

### Some Issues to look into:

â€¢ Where do webinos installers, policy managers and device settings apps sit in the webinos architecture? Do they need special consideration?
â€¢ How do proprietary applications (E.g. those installed by the device manufacturer) get installed and how do users know their provenance (e.g. why they were installed, who trusts them)
â€¢ How are application certificates, developer certificates, and general root certificates handled?

Conf Call Details (5/4/2011):

Intial Background work done on Java Script, Android, BONDI, W3C.

### Action Points:

**TUM, BMW**: Describe and Create Use cases, Requirements for engine diagnose API.
**Polito** with **Oxford**: To follow up and produce sequence diagrams in connection to Policy Management Data.

### Issues Addressed:

-   Privilege apps and services to Look into issues like Trust boundary, Identity and Integrity checks, Engine and HW management and some critical info of the Engine
-   Access sensitive API’s of vehicle, mobile, setup box
-   How to protect Runtime Enviroment from Hacks?
-   The Applications to be signed and confirmed by the Device Manufacturer when using Sensitive API’s and Critical data
-   To Monitor Engine data, mobile and setup box
-   To use Cryptographic methods, Encryption code for Security purposes

TUM, BMW: Describe Use case for engine diagnose API and
Polito: To follow up and work on how to bring it on with Policy management this and will provide a sequense diagram.

**New Use Case and Requirements: from (5/4/2011 - Conf call)**

### General Idea behind this:

**Trip logger**: We have an application which logs vehicle data for the trip. The User chooses which kind of vehicle properties he is willing to record. In General the vehicle API will provide access to wide range vehicle data (speed, fuel consumption, odometer, Geolocation).

**Note**:

-   The geolocation could possibly be also provided by the vehicle API, but we have already the Geolocation API.
-   Applications using the vehicle API have to be approved by the manufacturer of the vehicle/Device. If the application is not approved, then the application cannot access the vehicle API.
