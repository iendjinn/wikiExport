Automated weakness analysis using CAIRIS
========================================

Installing CAIRIS
-----------------

CAIRIS can be downloaded from the github at http://github.com/failys/CAIRIS. Before running CAIRIS, you need to install a few dependent open-source libraries. Assuming that you are running apt-get to download and install packages, the dependencies you need to install are:

-   mysql-server
-   python-mysqldb
-   graphviz
-   python-pyparsing
-   python-pydot
-   python-numpy
-   python-scipy
-   python-wxgtk2.8
-   python-wxtools
-   wx2.8-i18n
-   python-gtk2
-   python-glade2
-   docbook
-   dblatex
-   python-argparse

You also need to create a MySQL database to hold the CAIRIS runtime data. Things like the database name, user, password, and host need to be known to CAIRIS when it starts up, so you can either (a) base these on the contents of cairis.cnf in CAIRIS/cairis/cairis/config, or (b) create your own database configuration file (using the same format as cairis.cnf), putting this in the location of your choice, and setting the CAIRIS_CFG environment variable to point to this file.

Because the install scripts are still work-in-progress, the easiest way to get CAIRIS up-and-running is to download and unpack the latest sources and run the various scripts (i.e. cairis.py and cimport.py directory from CAIRIS/cairis/cairis directory).

Finally, if you plan to create goal and obstacle trees, you’ll need to set the database servers global max_sp_recursion_depth variable to allow recursive stored procedure. You can do this by running the below script (or a permutation of it based on what you’ve set your mysql root password as):

mysql -h localhost -u root <<!
set global max_sp_recursion_depth = 255;
flush tables;
flush privileges;
!

Step 1: Import the Requirements model
-------------------------------------

This entails running the regenerate.sh script in the scripts directory within the WP 2 git repository. This script imports the various bits and pieces from WP 2.4 and 2.5 into CAIRIS. Although the main purpose of the script is to generate redmine pages for D2.4 and D2.5, this is made possible by the import of several environments into CAIRIS including one global environment called _Complete_ . Because the script creates entries in /tmp/deliverable , you need to make sure this directory exists before running the script.

Step 2: Import directories
--------------------------

CAIRIS comes with a pre-defined directory of OWASP threat and vulnerability types, and "template" threats and vulnerabilities. These can be imported using the CAIRIS import tool by running:

cimport.py —import tvtypes CAIRIS/cairis/cairis/sql/owasp_tv_types.xml
cimport.py —import directory CAIRIS/cairis/cairis/sql/owasp_directory.xml

Step 3: Import component & connector view/s
-------------------------------------------

The next step involves creating and importing component & connector views you have created for the different parts of the webinos architecture. In addition to components and connectors, these files also contain a number of template access rights, protocol, privilege, surface type, asset, and requirements values that are referenced by the view. CAIRIS contains a demo component & connector view corresponding with the policy architecture. To import this into CAIRIS, just run:

cimport.py —import component CAIRIS/cairis/example/PolicyArchitecture.xml

When the component view has been imported, a visual representation of this view can be seen by clicking on the "View Component Model" toolbar button. In addition, component views and be examined and edited by clicking on the "Component" toolbar button. The main Component Views window also contains the attack surface metric values for the component view, in addition to its names.

Before going any further, it’s useful to do a weakness analysis of the component view, to check the usability impact of this view. To do this then open the Component Views dialog, right click on the view of interest, and select "Situate View". After selecting the Complete environment, a weakness analysis dialog box should open up. The threat and vulnerability pages should be empty because no threats or vulnerabilities have been introduced yet, but there may an impact to one or more of the personas. If there isn’t then you might want to check the component names used in the use case maps to make sure they are consistent with the component names used in the view. If there are values then, if you double click the persona name, you should see the tasks impacted by this view, the use cases associated with it, and the components associated with these use cases.

At this stage, you should click on Cancel from the weakness analysis dialog, as we won’t be situating this component view just yet.

Step 4: Import attack pattern/s
-------------------------------

To evaluate the component & connector views, we need to consider how it stands up to possible attack. Such attacks are encapsulated in _attack patterns_, an example of which can be found in CAIRIS/cairis/example/XACMLAttackPattern.xml. If you look at this file, you’ll see the contents are broadly aligned with the pattern template used for GoF patterns however, when imported into CAIRIS, these generate assets, attackers, vulnerabilities, threats, risks, and misuse cases. The assets are based on template assets, and — once imported — the values should be manually set based on what these are agreed to be. The vulnerabilities and threats are based on templates within the directory imported in step 1, so although these can be defined from the CAIRIS GUI, it’s a good idea to add anything that the pattern relies on within the directory file. The attack is based on an appropriate persona, which is defined in the WP 2 repository. An attack pattern file contains a single attack pattern, and can be imported by running:

cimport.py —import component CAIRIS/cairis/example/XACMLAttackPattern.xml

The resulting risk analysis model is visualised by clicking on the "View Risk Analysis Model" toolbar button.

At this point, it’s worth running a Weakness Analysis again. This time a number of threats and vulnerabilities will have been flagged. If these are addressed by the architecture then you should double click on the respective threats or vulnerabilities, select the requirement and asset that deals with the threat or vulnerability along with its effectiveness, and click on update. The component view can be situated by clicking on the apply button. When viewing the risk analysis model, mitigating threats or vulnerabilities should be displayed in a lighter colour.

Step 5: Revise the architecture
-------------------------------

If there are residual risk remaining, it’s a good idea to either update the existing component & connector view to address these, or import additional views where necessary. Bear in mind, however, that changes may themselves introduce additional problems. In either case, these changes can either be edited directly within CAIRIS, or the import scripts can be re-run. Incidentally, models can be imported/exported from within CAIRIS itself, as well as from the shell.
