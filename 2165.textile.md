Web Intents Security Points
===========================

The existing webinos security model
-----------------------------------

Access control is relevant for webinos primarily when web applications invoke webinos-provided APIs. We’ll ignore everything else for now.

Access control is implemented in webinos through two mechanisms: the personal zone overlay network for authentication and the policy system for authorisation.

### Access control in the personal zone

webinos APIs can be implemented by a number of devices or services. The complete set of these services is known to the personal zone, and consists of all the devices and services registered and enrolled with the personal zone hub and proxies. The zone **could**, therefore, be considered a big intent registry.

Registering devices in the personal zone involves interacting with the underlying public key infrastructure. Each device has a private key, and a device belonging to the zone’s owner will obtain a certificate by enrolling with the personal zone hub. Other user’s devices are added through certificate exchange in a process we have documented (poorly) on the WP3 wiki. These actions all involve user interaction and authorisation.

We have no documentation on how a remote _service_ (e.g. a remote API provided by a ‘virtual PZP’) might be added to a personal zone, but it is likely to be a simplification of the certificate exchange model for remote _devices_. In essence, Alice can access service X by instructing her personal zone to download its certificate.

### Access control through policies

Whether an application (or webpage) is able to call a certain API depends on access control policies based on the application’s identity or webpage’s origin. E.g., an application may be granted access to Geolocation, or not, at install time (widget) or first use (webpage).

Whether an application will receive a **response** after invoking an API depends on access control policies governing the whole system - e.g., a policy might allow an application access to the Geolocation API, but another policy might state that a specific API implementation on a particular device is **not** allowed. Furthermore, a policy may require user interaction: e.g., the policy may demand that users approve every request for an API through a dialogue box.

In general, we are very short of examples (certainly implemented ones) which show all the different patterns and interactions with the policy framework, and what is possible/impossible. In particular, some of our cross-platform use cases are a little vague.

In web intents, access control is provided through the ability to register an intent provider with user agent, the user’s decision to select a certain intent provider at runtime, and then any additional access control at the intent provider. More specifically, when Alice invokes the ’save’ intent, she is limited by:

** The list of ’save’ intent providers that are registered with her browser
* The ’save’ intent provider she actually chooses to use (this may not be the case if an intent is _explicit_)
* Access control at the provider- e.g., if she chooses Amazon S3, does Amazon S3 implement any access control for this action?

### Registering intents

The spec seems vague. It will probably be possible for the user agent to register intent providers through (1) visiting a page with registration markup and asking the user to approve registration (or just notifying them); (2) an external application or widget; (3) redirection to a page at some kind of app store listing available apps which can satisfy that intent; (4) explicit intent providers specified by the client application. (3) and (4) are not registration mechanisms but intent provider discovery mechanisms, strictly speaking.

The model is that the page advises of the ability to handle intents, and the User Agent may remember that.

The level of authenticity required for an intent provider is unspecified, as are the user flows. This is going to be important to get right if click-through style problems are to be avoided. The same issues affecting app stores will also matter - e.g., is the intent provider at https://www.facebook.com/save or http://www.faceb00k.net/save ?

While an install process would help, it would be tempting to conflate installation of an intent provider with installation of an application. Do you want to install an entire application in order to satisfy an intent? Because users are quite likely to do that if it’s made easy for them. This might result in the installation of a malicious app (with wide-reaching capabilities) in order to satisfy one less-security-sensitive intent. We should investigate how this is avoided in Android.
>>[Claes]: I understand the Android intents model so that the permissions for an Android application to send or receive intents is related to this applicationâ€™s API access permissions. This means that the Android intent handler authentication is based on user permissions given at application installation time. I assume that we need something better.

### Selecting the right intent provider

When non-explicit intents are invoked, the provider is selected by the end user. The spec states that:

> For intents invoked by client web applications, the User Agent must require that such invocations be in the context of a user gesture. User Agents may also dispatch intents invoked through other mechanisms. For example, hardware events (i.e. plugging in a USB storage device) or software events (i.e. downloading a file).

This is itself an important authorisation step, as the user is making an in-context decisions about which provider they trust in this particular instance. However, if queried too often, expect users to always click on the same box or always choose the same option. This problem has to be studied in context with particular use-cases.

For this reason, the spec states:

> In general, though, the User Agent must provide a way for the user to configure which intents are delivered to which services. This process should be configurable on a per-invocation basis for most intents, although defaulting rules, as long as they are configurable by the user, are expected to mean that the User Agent need not present specific UI controls on every invocation.

Defaulting rules therefore are equivalent to webinos having a "one-shot" policy for a particular application and API. The user is queried once, and then permission is always granted or denied based on the first decision.

Explicit intents do not _necessarily_ need user selection at runtime, although the user agent may do so:

> When handling an Intent marked as explicit (that is, constructed with the object literal constructor with a non-empty service field), the expected User Agent behavior is that if this "service" attribute is present, it should not display a service selection mechanism to the user. Instead, the service url should be loaded directly to handle the intent. (This is not a hard restriction. The User Agent may provide a way for the user to intercept even an explicit invocation.)

> The User Agent may ask the user if they wish to install this service, just like for any other visit of the page.

Intent selection is the main place where users make access control decisions in web intents. It’s not a bad place to do so, so long as the choice of intent provider is directly linked to the user’s current activity. If so, this is a contextual choice and demands little more effort or confusion. However, if intents are invoked that have little to do with the task at hand, then it is likely that users will be confused and make bad choices. They may either click "OK" at every moment, or cancel everything. These things only work well if they match the user’s train of thought and current activity.

Therefore, whether this model for access control is sensible depends on the context in which it is used. I suggest that it is only sensible when the user will definitely care about the selection of an intent provider.

### Access control at the intent provider

Having chosen the provider, there may be additional access control. E.g., the ‘save’ intent might be invoked and it might be provided by a local file store requiring additional user authentication and authorisation. Of course, there also may not be. Indeed, the intent provider may do anything with data and might provide insufficient access control. This leads nicely on to…

### Trusting an intent provider

As mentioned in the conference call, once we’ve handed over to a specific intent provider we lose control over how they will handle our data. This is actually very similar to handing data to a hosted webinos application - we have little control over what it will do, except when it accessed webinos APIs. For example, a hosted webinos app could store data on its host and pass it on to third parties. Indeed, an API _provided_ by a webinos application has exactly the same constraints as a web app implementing a webintent.

We are left in a situation where we have little _security_ and instead must employ _trust_. Establishing that a web intent provider is suitably trustworthy requires:

1.  Limiting the data given to an intent provider. This is reasonable, as the specifications should govern exactly what data can be transferred.
2.  Make sure that the intent provider is properly authenticated and installed by the user. They must know who the provider is, and that it isn’t being spoofed by someone else.
3.  Making clear what information is flowing to whom. For instance - making it clear that an intent provider will be given a particular piece of data, rather than data in general.

Ideally, an intent provider would be an application which itself uses webinos APIs. That would mean that the intent provider’s use of those APIs is within the policy system.

Privacy comparison (superficial)
--------------------------------

### WebIntents

WebIntents explicitly don’t allow the enumeration of potential intent providers. This is probably a good thing, as it prevents a webpage from working out which other web apps you have. This might be used to attempt password-reuse attacks, for example.

I am not sure how WebIntents communication happens and what the privacy implications are. It may be that messaging presents privacy issues. However, this seems relatively unlikely.

### Webinos

webinos relies entirely on access control and filters in the findService call. This might allow a rogue webinos app to profile the end user. I’m not sure whether we have a good answer to this problem at the moment - does our spec define how users select services?

Combining the models
--------------------

Todo: add more detail and thought

How do these different models - webinos and webintents - work if combined together?

Suggestions:

# the webinos personal zone can provide (to an extent) intent registration and storage of user preferences. Because we’ve got a reasonably well-defined model for adding devices and users to personal zones, webinos can add authenticity to this process.
**** The ability to synchronize intent registrations and user preferences across all devices in the zone can be compared to browser sync across all the devices a user owns, see "Firefox Sync":https://services.mozilla.com/. Mozilla suggest that this can be extended to shared devices such as a rented computer in an Internet cafe, where you can log into your personal session to gain temporary access to your personal data.
**** Intent registration may be the result of _Intent based search_ where the web run-time invites the user to search for intent providers. This is likely to evolve from a very limited start to a much richer model of intents, and provides a clear opportunity for Internet search engines to control the relationships between users, application developers and service providers.
# the webinos policy model would need to be altered to support intent selection.
* Potentially, a modified webinos policy system would need to refer to intent invocation as well as APIs. E.g., can application X invoke the ‘share’ intent? In this case, the possible policy settings might be:
**** "yes, show intent selection prompt each time",
**** "yes, show intent selection prompt the first time",
**** "yes, always use intent provider Y"
**** "no"
* One alternative would be for webinos apps in the browser to support intents, whereas apps in the widget runtime could support APIs
* The webinos policy options current refer to widget installation/first use, and runtime invocation events. These don’t quite fit the webintent model of registration and invocation, but aren’t far off. Registration seems a bit lighter-weight than Installation. Mixing them up might also be dangerous. It seems analogous to operating systems choosing the file types that they are associated with. In that vein, expect malicious apps to offer intents for _everything_.

Combining the models would require reworking quite a lot of the usecases and scenarios developed for policy enforcement. It would also require us to have a better spec for adding services to personal zones.

It is basically impossible to estimate the usability and security impact without more context and examples.
