h2. Scope and Objectives of the Area

The Context Awareness - Adaptations area addresses all issues relating to management of contextual information (detection, acquisition, representation, distribution,etc) as well as all the consequent activities (such as content Adaptations) that could enabled by being aware and process this information withing webinos.

In terms of its scope the present area comprises two disciplines, each one with its specific objectives.

h3. I. Management of Contextual Information

The scope of this area encompasses all the necessary activities that pertain to gathering, storing and making available context within webinos, particularly the following objectives are to be addressed:
** Identification of Context data relevant for the webinos operation.
* Detection of Context Data within webinos (through the webinos entities) and related Context Sources _identification of existing APIs to be used_
* Acquisition of Context Data for webinos system _identification of existing APIs to be used_
* Representation of Context Data within webinos _definition of the necessary context structures in specific data format_
* Storage of Context Data within webinos _definition of suitable data storage facility
* Distribution of Context Data among webinos entities _specification of the necessary APIs to be created_

### II. Context Awareness Driven Functionality

The scope of this area encompasses all the necessary functionality that can be enabled by accessing, processing and/or reasoning on the available Context Data. It can be considered on three levels of work effort necessary:

1. Adapting media content
* Minimal solution: provide functions for discovering if device is capable for handling the media type.
* Standard solution: provide functions that would simplify the process of converting media files using some external converter.
* Maximum solution: provide a build-in media converter (part of WRE?) capable of transcoding the media to the required format.

2. Adapting application UI
* Minimal solution: do nothing, rely on the browser/renderer capabilities to adapt the UI to different devices.
* Standard solution: provide functions/stylesheets for creating and rendering UI elements on different device types (part of WRE?).
* Maximum solution: provide UI layouts, which would behave and render differently on different devices.

3. Adapting graphics (canvas drawing)
* Minimal solution: do nothing, make sure that existing functions can return reliable information regarding screen/viewport sizes.
* Standard solution: provide functions for converting the canvas position to the position relative to the current device screen.
* Maximum solution: provide a canvas implementation capable of scaling the graphics to specific sizes.

4. Special adaptations, triggered by changing context
* Minimal solution: do nothing, rely on the fact that the application functionality can be changed at any point by retrieving device-specific information.
* Standard solution: provide a set of callbacks that would be automatically executed when context changes (e.g. a user’s friend is in range)
* Maximum solution: provide a mechanism for automatic adaptations and executing a set of actions in response to changing context (WRE with built-in Android Tasker functionality?)

#### The following objectives are to be addressed within each functionality area:

*1. Context Driven Content Adaptations*
* Adapting media content, **standard or maximum** solution Webinos allow for using an external converter for adapting media streams.
* Adapting application UI, **minimal or standard** solution through styling individual elements to have optimal behaviour and look on different types of devices.
* Adapting graphics, **minimal** solution AFAIK (providing functions which return screen/viewport size), mostly about HTML5 canvas operations, but it could include SVG as well.
* Special adaptations, **standard** solution, using old, plain Bondi API. The standard solution would mean extending the existing API by abstracting some of the concepts (e.g.check if application runs in a moving car by calling a single function, instead of reading a GPS position and checking how fast it changes).

*2. Social Proximity in Webinos*
* Definition of Social Proximity Concept within the webinos system (i.e. in relation to the way of operation, webinos entities, etc)
* Discovery of webinos Users in Social Proximity _specification of the necessary APIs to be created_
* Discovery of webinos Devices in Social Proximity _specification of the necessary APIs to be created_

_*note1:* this area constitutes the merging of the previous Context Management and Context-Driven Adaptation areas_

_*note2:* In terms of items to be delivered, this area follows the framework set by N. Allot in his mail on March 9th, specifically:_

> 
> * Research â€“ wiki, research notes, position papers
> * Data formats/schema â€“ syntaxes, formal wiki
> * Algorithms â€“ description of processes, wiki
> * Protocols â€“ over the air message flows (syntax and semantics), PlantUML, formal Wiki
> * Architecture â€“ wiki + PlantUML
> * APIs â€“ predominately on device, in process functions, and data formats (syntax and semantics) - WebIDL
> * Example code SVN

Area Sub-Projects
-----------------

In this area the broad scope of Context Awareness and Adaptations within webinos is divided into specific tasks whose purpose is to identify and model the necessary architectural components and their APIs that will enable the area’s objectives.

Given this objective, AutoI will design and develop, based on well-defined methodologies, an open software infrastructure and tools that enables the composition of better (fast and guaranteed) services in an efficient manner and the execution of these services in an adaptive (Autonomic form) way. |http://ist-autoi.eu/autoi/ |A big challenge has been the development of a context aware infrastructure for aggregation, refinement and dissemination in support of network bootstrapping, self-management, service overlay, and the use of network context information for self-adaptation in the provision of context-aware services. These capabilities will be extended to consider interaction with the service layer and to integrate convergence of network infrastructures as a research task into the AutoI project.|
|06|TANGO|Many everyday actions take place in a social context and affective information forms an important channel of social communication. The goal of the TANGO project is to take these two familiar ideas one radical step further by focussing on the essential interactive nature of social communication, in the domain of non verbal communication based entirely on facial and bodily expression.|http://spitswww.uvt.nl/tango/index.html | Development of an exact mathematical theory of emotional communicative behaviour. Based on such a theory combined with advanced methods from computer vision and computer graphics emotional interactions can be studied quantitatively in detail and can be transferred in technical systems that simulate believable emotional interactive behaviour. Based on the obtained experimental results and mathematical new generation of technical devices establishing emotional communication between humans and machines will be developed. |
|07|SIEMPRE|The goal of the SIEMPRE project is to develop novel research theoretical and methodological frameworks, computational models, and algorithms for the analysis of creative communication within groups of people.

|11|PERSIST|The vision of PERSIST is of a Personal Smart Space, which is associated with the portable devices carried by the user and which moves around with him/her, providing context-aware pervasiveness to the user at all times and places. The Personal Smart Space will cater for the needs of users, adapting to their preferences and learning new ones as these arise.|http://www.ict-persist.eu/|This project will develop Personal Smart Spaces that provide a minimum set of functionalities which can be extended and enhanced as users encounter other smart spaces during their everyday activities. They will be capable of learning and reasoning about users, their intentions, preferences and context. They will be endowed with pro-active behaviours, which enable them to share context information with neighbouring Personal Smart Spaces, resolve conflicts between the preferences of multiple users, make recommendations and act upon them, prioritise, share and balance limited resources between users, services and devices, reason about trustworthiness to protect privacy and be sufficiently fault-tolerant to guarantee their own robustness and dependability.|
|12|EBBITS|The ebbits project (Enabling business-based Internet of Things and Services) does research in architecture, technologies and processes, which allow businesses to semantically integrate the Internet of Things into mainstream enterprise systems and support interoperable real-world, on-line end-to-end business applications. |http://www.ebbits-project.eu|The ebbits platform will support interoperable business applications with context-aware processing of data separated in time and space, information and real-world events (addressing tags, sensor and actuators as services), people and workflows (operator and maintenance crews), optimisation using high level business rules (energy and cost performance criteria), end-to-end business processes (traceability, life-cycle management), or comprehensive consumer demands (product authentication, trustworthy information, and knowledge sharing). |
|13|SERENOA| Serenoa is aimed at developing a novel, open platform for enabling the creation of context-sensitive service front-ends (SFEs).

### IV. Academic research & Literature

#### Capability-driven Progressive Enhancement

Web systems are traditionally engineered along three orthogonal dimensions: the development phases, the system’s views, and its aspects (Schauerhuber. A. et al. 2002). The phase dimension sets out the different stages of web development, ranging from analysis to implementation. Each of these phases requires a number of specific views addressing the systemâ€™s content, its navigation structure, and the presentation. Finally, the aspects dimension defines the structural and behavioral aspects of each of the views.

![](http://www.wafl.ugent.be/webinos/dimensions.png)

The increasing importance of ubiquitous application development emphasizes the need for fragmentation management. This concern has to be handled throughout every stage of the applicationâ€™s development life cycle. As proposed by Kappel et al. 2002, adaptability can be considered as an additional web engineering dimension, crosscutting all other web modeling dimensions (cf. Figure 1). A straightforward incorporation of adaptability remains an important challenge (Koch. N. et al. 2008). The remainder of this section will describe how adaptability can be integrated in the development process of ubiquitous web applications by use of fine-grained progressive enhancement.

Since the early days of web engineering, developers have been trying to cope with the differences between browsers due to bugs and quirks. Graceful degradation is a widespread design strategy that focuses on providing optimal support for the most advanced browsers. Less capable browsers are only considered during the last development phase. This often results in a poor stripped-down version. The graceful degradation approach expects users to just upgrade their browser when the degraded version does not fit their needs. However, for most devices upgrading the default browser is not an option.

![](http://www.wafl.ugent.be/webinos/PE.png)

Progressive enhancement reverses the graceful degradation approach and aims at maximizing accessibility over browsers with different capabilities (Wells. J. et al. 2007). Progressive enhancement tries to achieve this goal by forcing developers to take the less capable devices into account from the very start of the development process. First, a basic markup document is created, providing an optimal experience for devices with the lowest common denominator (LCD) of available capabilities. Incrementally and unobtrusively, one or more layers of structural, presentational, and behavioral enhancements are added in function of the browser’s particular capabilities (cf. Figure 2).

The progressive enhancement philosophy can be used in a ubiquitous context to tackle fragmentation related issues. However, when turning the theoretical approach into actual practice, a number of important limitations come into play. Today, the use of externally linked resources (e.g. CSS, or JavaScript files) is the most common approach for the selection of enhancement layers. This limits the number of detectable variability points, because browsers will only check for coarse-grained styling and client-side scripting support. Compared to desktop browsers, the mobile ecosystem contains far more combinations of browsers with graded CSS and JavaScript support. To provide optimized usability, progressive enhancement should also reckon with the different interaction methods and hardware characteristics offered by devices. For example, a touch-based device will often require presentational enhancement layers, providing interfaces with more space to accurately click buttons, etc.

In order to create a viable ubiquitous progressive enhancement solution, it has thus become increasingly important to support the use of fine-grained enhancement layers. As shown in Figure 3, an intelligent mechanism is needed, supporting the automated creation of progressive enhancement stacks based on the specific capabilities of a device.

#### A Flexible Content Adaptation System Using a Rule-Based Approach [5]

In this paper the author proposes a rule-based content adaptation system. The rule-based approach should provide extensibility and adaptivity for the content adaptation. The rules are selected based on the content type being transformed and the client requesting the transformation. This paper mainly focuses on transforming the table structure object and uses fuzzy logic to model the adaptation quality and guide the adaptation decision.

#### A context-aware mobile mashup platform for ubiquitous web [6]

The authors propose that applying Web 2.0 and Ubiquitous Web concepts as guiding principles to design middleware infrastructure may ease the development and deployment of context-aware systems.

#### Architecture for Multimodal Mobile Applications [7]

The authors propose an architecture to enable multimodal mobile applications.
Accessibility!

#### Graceful Degradation of User Interfaces as a Design Method for Multiplatform Systems [8]

This paper takes the approach opposite capability-driven progressive enhancement and proposes, when starting with full-fledged applications, how to make them degrade gracefully so they remain useful on low-end devices.

#### Community-Driven Adaptation: Automatic Content Adaptation in Pervasive Environments [9]

The authors propose a content adaptation scheme where the adaptation is based on feedback from users. CDA groups users in communities based on common characteristics and assumes that users of the same community have similar adaptation requirements.

### V. Existing Technologies

#### MUSIC Middleware

This context middleware resulted from the MUSIC project (FP6, http://www.ist-music.eu). The middleware is responsible for collecting, aggregating, managing and sharing contextual information. Its purpose is to make this data available to context clients. The context information can be retrieved using hardware or software sensors on a wide range of devices. MUSIC contains reasonsers which process rough context data acquired by sensors in order to derive higher-level context information. The middleware uses a plug-in driven architecture to optimally support extensibility/modifiability requirements.

#### W3C example on context driven adaptation

The figure below (from http://www.w3.org/2001/di/IntroToDI.html) shows a client accessing a web application. The client and application server can interact directly, or through one or more proxies. A context-driven adaptation process can be introduced anywhere in this path:

-   Server: e.g. device independent authoring, semantic enhancement
-   Intermediary: e.g. content transcoding services (Opera Mini, Navorra, etc.)
-   Client: e.g. progressive enhancement, javascript feature/preference detection

#### Android fragments API

The fragments library introduces a mechanism that makes it easier for applications to scale across a variety of screen sizes. It allows developers to break up their applications into subcomponents called "fragments". Fragments allow developers to write modular applications with an adaptable layout the can run properly on both larger screen as well as smaller screen devices.
(cf. Figure below from http://developer.android.com/guide/topics/fundamentals/fragments.html).

#### Volantis Mobile Content Framework

The framework consists of several components:

-   Multi-Channel Server (MCS). The main component responsible for adapting the page to different devices.
-   Media Access Proxy (MAP). The component responsible for converting the media files (images, audio, video).
-   Device Repository Web Service (DRWS). The device database which holds information about devices and their attributes (+8000 devices and +850 attributes).

MCS receives the page description, retrieves the device capabilities using DRWS, and produces the page version optimized for the current device. Media files can be converted using the MAP service.

The page description consists of the following parts:

-   Page definition. The page definition is created using the XDIME 2 (xHTML Device Independent Markup Extension), a format which is similar to XHTML 2.
-   Page styles. The page styles are defined in the format similar to CSS 2, which is extended in order to allow support for custom layouts and images.
-   Page layouts. The page layouts are defined in the XML file. They can be defined either for all the page, or only for specific elements of the page.
-   Image definitions. As alternative to converting the images using MAP, it’s possible to provide several image variants and to define rules for selecting the optimal image variant.

Page styles, page layouts and image definitions contain sections which may be defined to be applied only to specific types of devices. The rules for applying the specific sections are defined using device attributes. Therefore it is possible to define, for example, that a 3 column layout is to be applied to all the devices which have the screen width bigger than 600 pixels, while all other devices should use single column layout. Or that a specific style should be applied to handheld devices running Symbian S60. Or that gray-scale, low-resolution logo should be selected when displaying the page on WAP devices.
