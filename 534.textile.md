Analytics
=========

Introducation to web and app analytics
--------------------------------------

Web analytics is about understanding what users do when they are accessing web services. The Official WAA Definition of Web Analytics is: "Web Analytics is the measurement, collection, analysis and reporting of Internet data for the purposes of understanding and optimizing Web usage". . http://www.webanalyticsassociation.org/resource/resmgr/PDF_standards/WebAnalyticsDefinitions.pdf). It is about capturing and analysing data derived web requests from indivudlal users, and so on.

Another definition is: "Web analytics is the process of analyzing the behavior of visitors to a Web site. The use of Web analytics is said to enable a business to attract more visitors, retain or attract new customers for goods or services, or to increase the dollar volume each customer spends" (http://searchcrm.techtarget.com/definition/Web-analytics).

Mobile application analytics is a related cousin of web analytics. In this case, the analytics occur inside the application instead of online on the web service as with web analytics. Applications currently offer the possibility to analyse not just web page access but also context information related to the device, the user, and so in. The storage of the data can be located either on the mobile handset, tablet, or in an online database. In principle, one could store information about the interests, time, location, file access, camera use, bar-code, devices, users nearby and so on locally on the device - and also even synch and store this on a remote server. App analytics one can achieve analytics both in even without internet connection, and synchronise at a later stage.

In this case, privacy and security architecture is even more pertinent, and analytics anchored in the webinos platform and applications will need special considerations, so that users can trust webinos at the same time as the information experiences and other offerings can be enhanced for them. Thus, the opportunity for webinos is to marry the best of both web and app analytics.

Objectives for analytics in webinos
-----------------------------------

The analytics in webinos is to be able provide end-users with enhanced information experiences and offerings. This will be achieved by an analytics package that can be used by each application. The analytics will be based on capturing and analysing web and application logs, and be able to provide information about the activities of the users of the application.

Problem statement "Understanding a day in the life of a user"
---------------------------------------------------------------

Being able to understand what the user is doing, or would like to do, is the underlying basis for work in the analytics field. The user interaction with the system is the main source of all analytics approaches. Traces, clues, and evidences can be found within each user session. This information is then sought used to enhance some service offerings to the users.

### What is within the session - activities and interests

Understanding what is going on within a session is a challenge. The first challenge is understanding what interaction is about one activity or interest. The interests and activities suddenly can change and it is important to be able to identify when this change in interest/ activity is happening. The second challenge is about being able to relate the user session to a specific individual. There can be several people using the same application and device over time, and this adds a lot of noise to each session seen from an individual user point of view.

### A session can continue on multiple devices

Never mind these two problems about understanding the activities and interests, and relating them to a person. The third challenge is is about the use of multiple devices. It is becoming very common for people to access information in a ubiquitous way through a perhaps a personal laptop, a desktop, a mobile phone, a TV, and a car infotainment system. They may as well frequently be sharing some of these devices with friends and peers too.

### A session can continue across applications

But, the problem statement for webinos analytics also has a fourth challenge. This is about multiple applications running on each device. In the part there was for instance one web browser on one device. Now it can be several web browsers on the same device. The last three years there has been an high growth in mobile applications that have the capability deliver and present multi-media content of various formats. Some of these can be seen as reduced web browsers, and the consumers are increasingly buying into these.

### Multiple information within the same application at the same time

The challenge of understanding whether an interest or activity occurred because of an advertisement, the current context, or the standard web site content seems to appear like a detail in this picture of trying to capture the session of a user as means to help.

With an ever growing availability of web content, analytics is here to be able to improve and enhance the information experiences and offerings to end users.
