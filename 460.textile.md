Overlay networking
------------------

-   [[Overlay networking]]

The overlay networking model shields users and web developers from lower level details for each interconnect technology. Lower level APIs are exposed by browser extensions and made use of by 3rd party libraries written in JavaScript. These libraries in turn expose higher level APIs for discovery, browsing the context and sending messages between devices. We need to prototype the overlay network model, but the emphasis will be on the usability of the high level APIs. The low level APIs will need to be standardized, but that can be done in a later phase.

Access to APIs on remote devices
--------------------------------

This wiki page documents brainstorming proposals: "Access to APIs on remote devices":http://dev.webinos.org/redmine/projects/t3-2/wiki/Access_to_APIs_on_remote_devices

Overview of Discovery Technologies
----------------------------------

Each interconnect technology can have its own discovery mechanisms, and some have several, each with their own terminology. Webinos will need to provide an overlay that abstracts away from the variations and which offers simple naming for end users and web developers. The overlay will need to store the mapping from user friendly names to the underlying data registered for the device and needed to communicate with it.

Interconnect technologies include:

-   3G, WiFi, WiMAX, Bluetooth, ZigBee, NFC, RJ45, USB, IEEE 1394, …

Only some of these support IP directly. Webinos should provide a means for an IP accessible device to proxy for devices that are not IP addressable.

### IP based networks

For IP based networks, three such mechanisms are:

#### Multicast DNS

Invented by Apple for simplifying the connection of devices in home networks. The Apple implementation is called "Bonjour". An open source equivalent is "Avahi". Devices start by randomly picking a link local IP address in the range (169.254.**.**) and making an ARP request to see if this address is already in use.

Devices assign themselves name in the ".local" domain, and will adjust this if they detect other devices with the same name. Users can assign human meaningful names with spaces in them. User agents query for devices with multicast UDP requests. The devices check for a match and respond with a multicast UDP packet with the IP address and port number, the device’s domain name, and a list of protocol and/or service names. The device domain names use human meaningful conventions e.g. "Dave’s laptop._workstation.local". A nice feature is the ability for a device to report on other devices including external services such as the BBC news on the Web, or a hotel’s local Web server giving details of the hotel’s services. Multicast DNS isn’t designed to support tens of thousands of devices, but this can be worked around with discovery hubs.

On Linux, try

mdns-scan

or

avahi-browse -a -v

This only found my Linux workstation on my WiFi network and not the ADSL Modem, nor the Samsung laser printer.


h4. Simple Service Discovery Protocol (SSDP)

Invented by Microsoft and considerably more complicated than Multicast DNS. SSDP is a UPnP-based protocol and it uses HTTP for notification announcements that give a service type URI and a unique service name.

On linux try

 gssdp-device-sniffer

On my WiFi network this found the ADSL Modem and the Laser printer, but not the Linux workstations.

h4. Service Location Protocol (SLP)

Defined in RFC 2608 and supported by Hewlett-Packard’s network printers, Novell, and Sun Microsystems, but ignored by some other large vendors. SLP works over UDP or TCP. On UDP, devices listen on port 427 for multicast requests. Devices advertise themselves with a URI like

 service:printer:lpr://myprinter/myqueue

This may be supplemented by a list of attributes, e.g.

<pre>
 (printer-name=Hugo),
 (printer-natural-language-configured=en-us),
 (printer-location=In my home office),
 (printer-document-format-supported=application/postscript),
 (printer-color-supported=false),
 (printer-compression-supported=deflate, gzip)
</pre>

If the data doesn’t fit in a single packet, a flag is given that the user agent can act on to request the SLP info via TCP. SLP also supports discovery agents and presumably this helps with scaling up to larger networks with bridged local networks.

h4. UPnP and DLNA

On linux try

 upnp-inspector

On my network this found the ADSL Modem but not my Laser printer.

h3. Other interconnect technologies

h4. WiFi

For WiFi it is possible to detect access points and what kind of encryption they are using, if any, as well as devices operating in ad-hoc mode. It should be possible to detect device MAC addresses.

h4. USB

For USB see the source code for the Linux lsusb command. This lists the bus and device number, the device ID and a human readable description e.g. Logic3 / SpectraVideo plc A4Tech SWOP-3 Mouse, and Microdia Sonix Integrated Webcam.

h4. Bluetooth

For Bluetooth, a scan shows the device ID and type, e.g. phone. This id can be used as a proxy identifier for people, i.e. who is present in the room or nearby. There is a small set of known device types, e.g. phone, input device, headset, modem, computer, network, camera, printer or video device. Users can provide a meaningful name for their device e.g. "Me" as seen for a phone in a car that drove past my window!

**Phase:** Webinos phase 1

|"Avahi Register Services API":http://avahi.org/download/doxygen/index.html based on "DNS-SD ":http://www.zeroconf.org/ |It uses DNS service locator (SRV), Text Record(TXT), and Pointer recorder (PTR) records to advertise Service Instance Names. The hosts offering services publish details of available services: instance, service type, domain name and optional configuration parameters. In case of mDNS, each computer on the LAN stores its own list of DNS resource records (e.g., A, MX, SRV) and joins the mDNS multicast group. If a unicast DNS is available, two ways to advertise services: via dynamic DNS server or manually add DNS records to describing the services to add. |Avahi had already become the de-facto standard implementation of mDNS/DNS-SD on free operating systems such as Linux.|Native Codes.

### High level Discovery API

**Description**

Currently there exist several methods to do service discovery. This has been explored in the state of the art investigation for service discovery. Some of these methods are fairly well deployed and used such as Bluetooth service discovery, Universal Plug & Play, mDNS or DNS Service Discovery. However, neither of these discovery methods has been exposed to web application developers. In addition methods like Universal Plug & Play, mDNS and DNS SD do not have any robust security model.

The goal with the webinos high level service discovery API is to be able to provide a simple API for application developers. The API shall provide the means to discovery services within personal zones and from low level service discovery methods supported by the device. The fact webinos uses a overlaying network, service discovery will not be limited to local services but will also enable to discover remote services. The API hides the complexity for communicating with services residing in a different peer in a trusted manner.
