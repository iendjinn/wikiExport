Authentication
==============

This section describes how authentication works in webinos. There are three types of authentication available in webinos, device authentication, user authentication and authentication with third party services (e.g. oAuth for Twitter). Support for the first two are specified in this section. Third part authentication in the case of OAuth 1.0 is described in the informative section of this specification.

User authentication
-------------------

### OpenID user credentials

**Users** are primarily authenticated through their OpenID credentials. This involves them connecting to their PZH web interface and logging in with whatever account they used to register the PZH in the first place. This process is described in more details in the "PZH":http://dev.webinos.org/redmine/projects/wp3-3/wiki/PZH section.

Authenticating with OpenID is a pre-requisite for many sensitive operations, but is not sufficient in its own right for accessing webinos APIs or other device features. It only allows a user to connect through the PZH web interface. Applications do not have access to any enhanced privileges through this.

Alternatively, on some devices users may log into the PZH web interface using just client-side X509 certificates. This is possible only when that device has been configured within the personal zone (based on a configuration file at the personal zone hub) to support this.

OpenID login MUST be requested using the PAPE extension and set max_auth_age=0 in order to prevent authentication caching.

Device authentication
---------------------

Devices are authenticated through the possession and use of an RSA private key. Having this key is a pre-requisite for a PZP connecting to a personal zone and sharing data with other devices, since it can be used to sign and to prove device identity. More details as to the keys and certificate present on webinos devices can be found in the [[Personal Zone Key Infrastructure]] section

#### Sequence diagram - device held private key authentication

![](device-held_private_key_seq.png)

This credential can be used peer-to-peer as well as when connected to the personal zone hub. When used peer-to-peer, there is a risk of the key having been revoked but the other device not being aware of this because it has not been connected online and synchronised. When used via the personal zone hub, this is not an issue, as the PZH will know if the credential has been revoked. More details on the use, management and distribution of keys and certificates within a personal zone can be found in "Personal Zone Key infrastructure section":http://dev.webinos.org/redmine/projects/wp3-3/wiki/Personal_Zone_Key_Infrastructure

The device-held private key is not strictly a user authenticator, but a device authenticator. However, for many situations it can be considered another factor. E.g., for a device with generally a single owner (a mobile phone) then it is a reasonable authenticator for many things. The key can also be considered a useful authenticator when the device is not being currently operated by the end user. E.g. a home PC being accessed remotely.

In order to make sure that a private key is used appropriately — e.g. it cannot be used by a frequently shared device as user identity — it must be integrated with the policy system and with the local device’s authentication. For instance, the private key will be held in a key storage ("key storage interface":http://dev.webinos.org/redmine/projects/wp3-3/wiki/Personal_Zone_Key_Infrastructure#Key-Storage-Interface , "key storage implementation":http://dev.webinos.org/redmine/projects/wp3-3/wiki/PZP_Deployment ), which requires the user to prove their presence by unlocking it. Furthermore, it can interact with the authentication API, such that an application can work out whether the user is still present or not.

### Presence - authenticating to the local device

![](presence_seq.png)

Devices have different modes of interaction with users. Sometimes presence is assumed (smartphones) and sometimes it is not (shared TVs, home servers).

-   Devices with assumed presence are defined as ‘private’ devices. Their keys are marked as such. Use of these device keys implies that the user is present.
    -   If a policy refers to just the end user, and not a specific device, then these devices will automatically match this policy. E.g. "Justin can access file X" would allow Justin to access file X from his ‘private’ device.
-   Devices without assumed presence (and this is the default) are defined as ‘shared’ devices. Use of a shared device does not imply that the user is necessarily present.
    -   If a policy refers to just the end user, and is about access to a local device API, then the user must re-authenticate using the Authentication API OR OpenID.
    -   If a policy refers to just the end user, and is about access to a remote API, the the user must re-authenticate using OpenID.

Authentication state machine
----------------------------

The following state diagram shows the permitted states a user (or rather, their user agent) can be in. This does not include ‘presence’ via local authentication.

![]({width:800px}user-authentication.png)

The PZP will not be aware of which state they are necessarily in. For example, the PZP will know whether it is in "DeviceKey" or "Unauthenticated" state, but will not know whether the user has logged in with OpenID to the hub.

Actions requiring authentication
--------------------------------

The following actions must require user authorisation, which will require authentication of the current user.

Local authentication refers to an invocation of the authentication API. Remote authentication refers either to OpenID login to the PZH or use of a PZP private key in situations where that is sufficient to

This table considers the potential threat of an unknown user performing this action on a shared device (e.g., a "friend" on a shared TV).

Initiating OpenID authentication from the PZP
---------------------------------------------

Because the PZP does not know whether the user is logged into the PZH with OpenID or not, the PZH will provide an interface for authorising requests initiated by the PZP. The following sequence diagram describes the process:

![](pzp-openid.png)

Note that the PZH is used as a web server in this diagram. This sequence diagram can be described in text in the following way:

1.  The user attempts to perform the privileged action on the PZP
2.  The PZP forwards this request to the PZH
3.  The PZH replies: "authentication required" + URL
4.  The PZP opens a web browser and directs the user to the provided URL
5.  The user must log in to this URL
6.  The page presents an authorisation prompt explaining the action requested and the impact of the action on the personal zone
7.  The user approves or rejects the prompt
8.  The action is carried out or not, depending on the decision made.

An example for authorising a zone-wide policy change is given below:

1.  The user changes XACML policies, this updates the local copy of policy.xml
2.  The PZP attempts to synchronise the new policy by pushing changes to the PZH
3.  The PZH sends a message to the PZP requiring authentication at pzh.example.com/alice%40foo.com/authorise/[session id]
4.  webinos opens a new browser window pointed at this page
5.  The user must log in to access this page using their openid credentials
6.  The page then presents a prompt showing the user what their policies changes mean
7.  The user approves or rejects the changes
    1.  On success, the new policy is synchronized and updated on the hub.
    2.  On failure, the new policy is overwritten.

The following messages are exchanged between PZP and PZH. We do not show the messages relating to the initial action request as this is activity-specific.

  _. Entity               _. Authenticates a personal zone proxy by
