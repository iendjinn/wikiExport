Webinos invitations
===================

What is certificate exchange, and why does it matter?
-----------------------------------------------------

Certificate exchange (not quite analogous to "friending" on a social network, but not totally different) is an important part of the webinos security framework, because it is what authenticates every transaction. If Ethan can pretend to be Alice, he can probably persuade Bob, Clara and Justin to connect to him and give him access to their personal data and devices. It enables enormous amounts of social engineering as well as outright personal data theft.

With that in mind, we have to be careful to implement certificate exchange in a secure manner.

There have been a couple of approaches, the one I have just implemented is sending an "invitation" to other users to connect.

What are invitations?
---------------------

The current "invitation" approach goes something like this, assuming Alice wants to invite Bob to connect:

1.  Alice’s PZH creates a unique URI, on her PZH’s domain (say pzh.example.com/alice/xyz123…) which an external user can click on to connect to Alice. This link is effectively a bearer token which authenticates the person who receives it, based on the assumption that this URI is sent to the right person.
2.  Alice sends it out through a different, authenticated channel - Facebook message, SMS, Twitter DM, email - to her invitee, Bob.
3.  Bob clicks on the link. This takes him to Alice’s PZH web server, which checks that the unique URI is valid, meaning that it must be Bob.
4.  Alice’s PZH redirects to Bob’s PZH, passing Bob’s PZH all of Alice’s PZH’s connection details.
5.  Bob’s PZH asks Bob if he wants to add Alice’s PZH to his list of known people. We assume Bob says yes.
6.  Bob’s PZH makes a GET request to Alice’s PZH stating that the connection was approved, and giving Alice’s PZH all of Bob’s certificates. This again uses the unique URI to authenticate Bob.
7.  Alice’s PZH, on receiving the request, collects all of Bob’s PZH’s details and adds to her list of trusted identity certificates, and returns a response message.
8.  Bob’s PZH adds Alice’s certificates to his list of trusted identity certificates.
9.  Certificate exchange complete: the two PZHs now establish a connection.

Issues
------

Here are the bits that I have some problems with -

### Issue A: the other channel

In step (2), Alice sends a link through a separate channel. Unfortunately, this makes the whole process reliant on Alice, not Alice’s PZH. Alice may make mistakes, and might send it to the wrong person. We can mitigate this by making sure Alice only sends links through social network channels (never via email / other less reliable means) but this still is prone to error. Also, if someone has access to this channel, they can forward that link to anyone. Ultimately we’re relying on a second channel which almost certainly has unreliable security properties.

### Issue B: encouraging spam and phishing

In step (3) we are training users to click on dodgy links from unknown URLs! This is bad news. Again, we can improve this by only using authenticated channels (such as Twitter direct messages, Facebook messages) but these are also subject to abuse - lots of people have their online identities stolen. We’re essentially increasing the incentive for someone to do so, without increasing the strength of the authentication mechanism.

### Issue C: lack of identity information

In step (5) we would like to tell Bob who Alice is, before he adds her to his personal zone. However, we don’t actually have any information about who Alice is, only information about who Alice **claims** to be.

For instance, if Ethan sent Bob and email with an invitation to Ethan’s personal zone, Ethan could impersonate Alice by having a PZH set up to look like Alice’s PZH, and Bob’s PZH would have no way of distinguishing between them. This means that we can’t actually present Bob with any verifiable information, we can only ask him to approve the process.

Another part of this problem is the fact that we’re relying on social network identity. This is pretty good, but there’s nothing stopping Ethan from setting up a new Facebook profile that looks like Alice’s profile, and then creating a PZH Account based on this identity.

Mitigations
-----------

There are a few mitigations I can think of that might help the situation.

### Rely on social media.

Invitations over email are a big, obvious threat. Instead, we should only allow links to be sent over social media, not via email / other channels.

### Use information from other sources.

The hubs that Bob is already connected to could tell Bob’s Hub whether they are connected to Alice. This is much like a "mutual friends" system. This would require an additional API.

### Introduce a second proof system.

When creating a PZH, it could post to your social network’s wall / feed stating your PZH’s address.

When you then invite other people to your personal zone, you could include a link to that posting (such as facebook.com/john.p.lyle/posts/37945729 ) which could be used to demonstrate that you are who you say you are. This can work on Facebook, Twitter, Google+. It’s very much like WebID.

Admittedly, this doesn’t work if someone has compromised your social network identity and added a new post. But a time-lag could help there (e.g., the post must have been a day or so ago). It also relies on everyone’s PZH being able to interpret those posts correctly (e.g., it’s a post, not a comment on a post by someone else).

### Require Alice to authenticate to Bob.

Using the previous system, if Alice wants to connect to Bob, she visits his PZH and logs in using her social network account. This gives Bob accurate information about who Alice is, assuming nobody has stolen her credentials. Bob is then in a stronger position to make a decision about whether to approve Alice as a connection.

This is the way the old system works. It improves on invitations, because you don’t need to worry about a third channel. The hard part is Alice finding Bob’s PZH address. This could be solved through the "second proof system" approach, potentially. Or it can be done by Alice issuing Bob with an invitation with a webinos:// URI rather than a web URI. This invitation link would be handled by Bob’s WRT, which knows his PZH.

### Simpler but less-automated invitations

Rather than invitations which are also implict authenticators, an invitation could just be a way of starting the old certificate exchange process. E.g., the following steps:

-   Alice uses her PZH to send messages to all her contacts, telling them about her PZH web address. This would send a URI such as "webinos://dashboard/adduser?user=alice@pzh.example.com"
-   Bob receives this message and his dashboard loads the URI. He is then taken to Alice’s PZH page and authenticates himself to it, by logging on with his OpenId/Facebook/Twitter
-   Alice is then notified that Bob would like to connect. She approves the connection.

Again, this would be strengthened by using better secure channels, and if there was any second proof system. Ultimately, this suggestion is a combination of all the other three.

### Introducing "authentication confidence"

Inspired by PGP, we could introduce a confidence factor in each person who performs certificate exchange. This would indicate how much we believed their identity was accurate. This could then be used in the policy framework to limit the privileges that person could request. E.g., file system access would require a high authentication confidence. This same system could be used for local authentication, too.

### Trusting the PZH Provider

If everyone was based at the same PZH provider, this problem would be easier. We could all trust the PZH provider to authenticate all invitations and responses, and to present accurate information about the end user. Unfortunately this makes webinos a massively centralised system.

If everyone has their own provider, the problem is much harder, as we can’t trust any provider or hub to present reliable information.

There is an in-between option: we could assume that each provider trusts a set of other providers. They could share sufficient information to make it more like everyone was at the _same_ provider. Admittedly, this kind of ecosystem has significant downsides, and relies on cooperation between businesses.

### Face-to-face authentication only

We could abandon purely online certificate exchange, and require all exchange to include a face-to-face authentication check.

Why is this problem so hard?
----------------------------

Note that this problem is made harder because we have multiple, independent PZHs. We’re effectively trying to implement friend-requests without a central authority, and without being identity providers ourselves.

Because there isn’t a single authority, they can’t manage identities or communication in a trustworthy way. Which is why Facebook and LinkedIN don’t have this problem. In webinos, each hub could be malicious, and we have no strong binding between user ID and personal zone hub.

I’m pretty sure this is a problem that could generate many academic papers.

Implementation issues
---------------------

As a technical aside, there are some other (solvable) problems.

1.  Alice needs to obtain Bob’s PZH details at some stage. We’re currently doing that using a variable held in webinos.session. This isn’t protected, meaning that any website can identify your PZH Address. An API needs to be written to protect this.
2.  We’re having to use GET requests to modify state when doing certificate exchange. This is bad practice, but it’s not obvious how to avoid it without disabling our CSRF support.
3.  Guessing of invitation URIs is possible, even if they are long. It wouldn’t be too hard to constantly search for valid invitation URIs, and I haven’t worked out how plausible this would be.
