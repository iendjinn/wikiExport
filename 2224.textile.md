The W3C calendar module
-----------------------

### Overview of API

http://www.w3.org/TR/2011/WD-calendar-api-20110419/

The Calendar API defines a high-level interface to access Calendar information such as events, reminders, alarms and other calendar information. The API itself is designed to be agnostic of any underlying calendaring service sources.

Security and Privacy considerations are already described in "this part of the specification":http://www.w3.org/TR/2011/WD-calendar-api-20110419/#security-and-privacy-considerations .

### Threats

#### API-Specific threats and misuse cases

1.  Distribution of user calendar details - privacy issues abound. Sharing with unauthorised parties may result in embarrassment, loss of income (meeting information may be valuable to businesses) or impact on the safety of the end user.
2.  Targeted advertising based on calendar event information
3.  Stalking possible if the wrong person is given access to calendar entries
4.  "Misuse case":http://dev.webinos.org/redmine/projects/wp2-8/wiki/Risks_misusecases#Navigation-Misuse-Case - Calendar details shared over unprotected communication medium and accessed by unauthorised parties, allowing them to rob the victim when they know he will be at an appointment.
5.  Not all calendars are created equally - some will be used for business, others personal, others are common events. Granting access to one should not automatically grant access to them all.
6.  The details of contacts who have been added to meetings or appointments might be revealed through use of the calendar API in an unexpected way.

#### Extended threats based on editing calendars

1.  Spam through an unauthorised application adding calendar entries
2.  Missing appointments or loss of information due to an application deleting entries or adding too many unwanted entries

#### Threats based on remote invocation of this API from another device

1.  Peter might allow his application access to the Calendar on his PC, knowing that there is nothing important in it. However, it then has access to his mobile phone calendar, which is much more personal and sensitive.
2.  There could be an unexpected ripple-effect when deleting a calendar entry - deleting it on one calendar could impact all calendars on all devices unexpectedly.

#### Implementation threats and possible attacks

#### Threats to apps and developers using this API (E.g. Jimmy and Jessica)

-   The Calendar API might return enormous amounts of data, causing any Web Application to crash or fail.
-   Calendar data from public calendars might be used to perform XSS or XSRF attacks.

#### Threats to device manufacturers, operators, other stakeholders

### Mitigations

These apply: http://www.w3.org/TR/2011/WD-calendar-api-20110419/#security-and-privacy-considerations

1.  User consent required for accessing each calendar
2.  Separation of calendars is important - access to one calendar should not imply access to others
3.  Could the API support "busy/free" invocation methods rather than precise information about each event? (this would involve a modification to the API)
4.  Granularity is important
    1.  Applications should state how much calendar information they will request and why.
    2.  permission might be granted just for an application to see whether a particular time is free or busy, but not any details
    3.  permission might be granted to view calendar items but not edit (editing is not technically in the specification)

5.  Revocation of consent is necessary.
6.  Suggest a three-phase policy per calendar: "allow all", "allow view busy/free", "deny"

### Recommended default policy rules for applications

  ------------- ------------------------------------------------------
  _.Code   _.Type
  B-A           Browser-based, authenticated via TLS certificates
  W-R           Widget, authenticated using a recognised certificate

Applications will be granted access to this API without user consent being required. This can only be modified using a policy editor.
                                         Default allow (install time)        Widgets will need user consent at install time, but users will expect to allow it (the tick-box will automatically be filled in).                        Web pages will prompt for consent (Yes / No / Always) at runtime, this preference will be saved.
  X            X                         Default ask at runtime (one-shot)   Widgets will require one-off user consent at runtime. This fact will be visible & modifiable at install time.                                            Web pages will prompt for consent (Yes / No / Always) at runtime, this preference will be saved.                                       Default ask at runtime (every time)   Widgets will require user consent at runtime, every time. This fact will be visible & modifiable at install time.
                            X            Default deny (install time)         Widgets will require user consent at install time, but users will expect NOT to allow it (the tick-box will automatically be empty).                     Web pages will display a short notification at first-use saying that access was denied, with a button to change settings
                                         Silently deny                       2. Applications will not be granted access to this API, and users will not be asked at install time. This can only be modified using a policy editor.

Rationale: accessing a calendar ought to require explicit consent, and most pages ought to deny it by default. For those pages and widgets which are from known sources, it is reasonable to expect that consent is likely to be granted after one question.
