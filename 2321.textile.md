Task 3.3 Workshop meeting
=========================

The meeting will be held in Berlin @ Fraunhofer FOKUS from August 20th to August 22nd.

The goal of the Task 3.3 workshop meeting will be to have a final push on completing the remaining system specification activity.

At the end of the meeting we wish also to allocate any uncompleted or remaining tasks (with definitive deadlines) to partners to complete the system specifications before delivery at the end of August. This would give people around 1 week - 10 days to complete these actions.

It is hoped that by the end of the meeting that the system specifications will be pretty near to completion - better yet if some of the specs are completely ready.

Availability
------------

Remember the meetings will be held in Berlin - we are likely to use most of all three days - maybe with a 10am start first day & 4pm finish last day. We will try and publish a suggested agenda soon.

There are two date ranges available on consecutive weeks for the Task 3.3 specification meeting. The meeting will be scheduled to be 3 days long, and we will try and cover all specifications and sub-sections in detail at some point during the three days.

Please can you indicate your estimated availability for each individual day in the tables below - Its is unlikely we can accommodate everyone’s individual schedule preference, but we will try and choose a date based on the best attendance, and key persons attendance/availability.

**Please Mark the table as follows:**
A = Available
X = Not available
? = Possibly available

Mon 20th - Wed 22nd August*

Venue
-----

The meeting will be held at Fraunhofer FOKUS in Berlin, Germany http://www.fokus.fraunhofer.de/en/fokus/index.html.

**Our main room is Room 1008. Just use the elevators and go to the first floor (during daytimes you don’t need an access token for the first floor). Then use the right floor and there the first room on the right side (1008).**

We will probably have two smaller rooms available for work in smaller groups, most likely 1001b and 1019, but let’s meet first at 1008.

We’ll provide coffee, WLAN and some sort of lunch (not sure yet whether this will be cooked lunch or sandwiches, but you’re not going to go hungry). We won’t have a (paid for) social event, but we’ll try to do this like in Delft and
make restaurant reservations, so if people want to eat as a group, they know where to go.

The usual rules and conditions apply - if you really care, you will find them attached at the bottom of this page.

### Food

We’ll have coffee and lunch available for the meeting days.

#### Monday evening

While we won’t have a free social event as such (no budget for these things in WP-specific meetings) we got a reservation for Monday evening at 18:30 at ‘zeitlos’ in Franklinstr.10, which is a sort of inner city ‘beach bar’ not too far from FOKUS (according to Google Maps it’s 1.7 km or 20 minutes walk). Good destination in case of sunny weather and they got indoor space in case it rains.

#### Tuesday evening

Given that we seem to have a clear split between cocktail drinkers and beer drinkers, we reserved a table at a ‘beer garden’ for Tuesday. The reservation is for 18:30 at the Schleusenkrug ( http://www.schleusenkrug.de/ ).

There’s a light drizzle predicted for this evening, but the table should have some sort of rain protection, so we’re going to be fine.

The easiest way to get there (for those at the Econtel) is probably taking the X9 bus to the Zoo Station and walk North from there (parallel to the Zoo fence).

Alternatively, if you like to walk, you can just follow path along the south bank of the river/channel. It’s about three kilometers, but it’s basically all a pedestrian path by the water.

Getting to Fraunhofer FOKUS
---------------------------

Fraunhofer Institute FOKUS
Kaiserin-Augusta-Allee 31
10589 Berlin

### By car

Take the Autobahn 115 (Avus) from Hanover, Leipzig, Nuremberg or the A 100 and at the junction follow the signs to Charlottenburg, then take the exit at Spandauer Damm , turn right, go straight ahead. After passing the Schloss Charlottenburg turn left over Luisenplatz and MierendorffstraÃŸe (right) to Mierendorffplatz (right) into the Kaiserin-Augusta-Allee till you get to Goslarer Platz. Or take the A 115 or A 111 till you reach the motorway interchange Autobahndreieck Charlottenburg, take the exit for Jakob-Kaiser-Platz onto the Tegeler Weg, turn left into the OsnabrÃ¼cker StraÃŸe and follow it to its end, then cross over Mierendorffplatz into the Kaiserin-Augusta-Allee and follow it till you reach Goslarer Platz.

### By train

At Berlin Hauptbahnhof (main station) take the Expressbus TXL (direction: Airport Berlin Tegel) to the stop at TurmstraÃŸe/BeusselstraÃŸe. Change to bus M27 (direction: S+U Bahnhof Jungfernheide) and get out at Goslarer Platz. The Institute is directly in front of the bus stop.

### From the airport to the Fraunhofer Institute FOKUS

The airport Flughafen-Tegel is located approx. 5 km from FOKUS. Take the express bus (line X9) to bus stop S+U-Bhf Jungfernheide. There you change to bus line M27 (direction S-Bhf Pankow). Leave the bus at bus stop Goslarer Platz. You can also take a taxi, it costs about 10 EUR (one way).

The airport Flughafen-SchÃ¶nefeld is located approx. 30 km southeast from the center of the city. There is the S-Bahn service S9 and the Airportexpress (Regionalbahn) that will bring you in approx. 40 min to the station Berlin Hauptbahnhof. At Hauptbahnhof please follow the description given above.
In fact, it is possible to take a taxi, but we do not know the price you will have to pay. It might come close to 45,00 EUR.
