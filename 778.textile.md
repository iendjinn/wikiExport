Methodology
===========

The methodology used in WP 3.2 were according to the following steps:

1. Identify needed APIs based on requirements:

-   Use cases and requirements defined in WP 2 were analyzed in order to identify needed APIs.

2.Identify needed APIs based on Webinos architecture:

-   In parallel with the ongoing specification of the Webinos architectural platform elements in WP 3.1 needed APIs were identified.

3. API investigations:

Based on step 1 and 2 existing APIs from W3C, WAC and elsewhere were investigated. The result of these investigations were:

-   Description of referred APIs from W3C, WAC or elsewhere that can be used by Webinos without modification.
-   Description of referred APIs from W3C, WAC or elsewhere that can be used by Webinos with modifications.
-   Description of new APIs that need to be specified within the Webinos project.

4. API specifications:

-   Creation of new Webinos API specifications.
-   Creation of specifications of Webinos modifications/extensions to existing APIs where needed.
-   Creation of Webinos "wrapper" specifications for referred API specifications.

5. Prototyping and demos

-   Creation of API stubs and small demo applications to test API applicability for developers.

Further work will be performed within WP 8.1 to propose new Webinos specifications and modified standard specifications to relevant standardization organizations.
