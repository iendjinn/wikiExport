1 Introduction
--------------

This chapter describes the webinos architecture, which is centered around the concept of a Personal Zone as a means to organise personal devices and services. Each device, whether it be a mobile, tablet, desktop, smart TV or in-car unit device, is extended to enable the device to be a part of the Personal Zone. Services are the webinos way of exposing APIs. The webinos architecture seeks to make it easier for web application developers to create applications that span devices of different hardware platform and operating systems. This is achieved through:
* Logical communication paths based on mutual authentication, and decoupled from underlying interconnect technologies
* Simple discovery of devices/services
* Simple access to local and remote services
* Adaptation based on the context of user, device and environment, e.g. day/night, quiet/noisy and locations

Practically, webinos provides web application developers with a collection of APIs. The APIs are specified in the webinos project deliverable D03.4. Not only exposed with a set of webinos services implemented by webinos itself, these APIs also can be realised through 3rd party components. We believe this will lead to a market for such components as the demand is stimulated by the continuing evolution of devices and interconnected technologies. This will, in turn, feed the market for services provided by web developers.

webinos builds upon the state of the art for web applications. Taking HTML5 and W3C Device APIs Working Group (DAP) technologies as a foundation, it extends these concepts to allow for the following:
* applications which make effective use of the resources on the devices of TV, automotive, tablet, PC and mobile;
* applications which interoperate over diverse device types;
* applications which can make use of services on other devices owned by the same person and other people;
* discovery of services, devices and people, on multiple interconnect technologies - even when they are not connected to the Internet;
* efficient communication that can pass messages over different physical bearers and can make sensible use of scarce network resources;
* ensured security with mutual authentication and privacy protection - webinos features strong authentication of all devices within a Personal Zone and between Personal Zones - tackling the spoofing and phishing weaknesses of the Web head on;
* and finally, distributed user preferences and user centric policies in XACML (eXtensible Access Control Markup Language):
**** allowing the user to define what applications work on which devices,
**** defining privacy preserving policies, defining what information is exposed to other services, and
**** ensuring these capabilities are interoperable and transferable - ensuring a user stays in control of his or her devices and applications.

2 webinos Personal Zones
------------------------

webinos introduces the concept of Personal Zone as an overlay network. It provides a basis for managing the user’s devices, together with the services running on them. This also includes personal services the user uses in the Cloud. The Personal Zone supports:
* Single sign-on, where the user is authenticated to a device and applications, and the device is authenticated to the Personal Zone. This avoids the need for establishing direct peering relationships between each pair of devices. It also allows for stronger authentication with the services the user uses. The architecture also allows for situations where the user is offline, e.g. when the user is away from home and currently unable to access the Internet.
* Shared model of the context. This covers users, device capabilities and properties, and the environment. It enables applications to dynamically adapt to changes, and to increase usability by exploiting the context.
* Synchronisation across the devices in the zone. This includes support for distributed authentication, as well as personal preferences, and replication of service-specific data, e.g. social contacts, and appointments. Synchronisation is essential for supporting offline usage.
* Discovery and access to services. This includes local discovery, e.g. of services exposed by the user’s devices, whether connected through Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, or USB, as well as remote discovery for services exposed in the Cloud. The high level discovery API allows Web developers to search for all local services, or to filter by service type and context, or even to locate a named service instance. Remote discovery is based upon existing user names and Email addresses, resolving to a URI for a Personal Zone.

The Personal Zone is implemented on a distributed basis, consisting of a single Personal Zone Hub (PZH) and multiple Personal Zone Proxies (PZPs). Figure 1, as a specification level deployment diagram, depicts the concept of Personal Zone. Inside the Personal Zone each device installed with a PZP is connected to the PZH. The PZH is identified by a URL, supporting RESTful APIs through JSON-RPC [JRPC]. The basic webinos functionalities, service discovery, authentication, and synchronisation, can be carried out on a intra and inter Personal Zone base. Session-wise communication between devices may take place directly independent of bearer technologies. PZH and PZP are described in following sub-sections 2.1 and 2.2 respectively.

The webinos overlay network is shown in Figure 2. The webinos network including its entities is overlaid upon current Web. Normally the PZH is hosted by a PZH provider, which provides Cloud services. PZP resides with a user’s device. A TLS session is set up between PZH and PZP, controlled by security policies.

### 2.1 Personal Zone Hubs (PZHs)

To enable external access to a Personal Zone, webinos defines a Personal Zone Hub (PZH) as a service that is accessible via the Internet, which is available 24x7, unlike personal devices that may be powered down or out of communications range. There is a one-to-one correspondence between Personal Zones and PZHs. Each PZH belongs to only one user. This could for instance, be provided as a value-added service to users by ISPs (Internet Service Providers) or it could be integrated in the DSL router at home. The PZH is identified by a URL. It is part of the Personal Zone and supports access by the Personal Zone owner from other devices. E.g., when the owner is using a public computer in a Internet Cafe, the PZH enables him or her to access his or her Personal Zone’s devices and services for the duration of a browsing session. It also enables access by others, subject to the policies that the owner has defined.

The PZH further provides support for discovering other PZHs based upon someone’s full name, pseudonym, or Email address. Note that users may choose to limit discovery, e.g. to people within a given group, or to prevent discovery altogether, in which case it is up to the user to communicate the URL for their PZH to others as needed.

Followings are the critical functions that a PZH provides:
* A fixed entity to which all messages can be sent to and routed on - a personal postbox as it were
* An authoritative master copy of a number or critical data elements that are to be synchronised between PZPs and the PZH, specifically
**** certificates to authenticate PZPs/PZHs of _trusted people_ against each other
**** application identifiers (and/or certificates) of applications granted access into the Zone
**** service identifiers (and/or certificates) for trusted services to which the Personal Zone may attach
**** device identifiers, to assist with platform integrity tests
**** credentials for "non webinos" services to give a pseudo single sign-on experience
**** all policy rules, for distributed policy enforcement
**** all relevant context data
* and the security functions of
**** user authentication
**** PZP secure session creation for transport of messages and synchronisation
**** service session creation for secure transport of messages between applications and services
**** secure social networking: using the exchanged certificates between _trusted people_
**** potentially, single sign-on service to other web services, using the PZH as a secure proxy
* Context synchronisation: the PZH should act as the master repository for all context data

### 2.2 Personal Zone Proxies (PZPs)

The webinos Personal Zone Proxy runs locally on a personal device. As a satellite proxy it acts like both a server (when talking to the end user on behalf the PZH) and a client (when talking to the PZH on behalf of the user and local services and applications). PZP hosts webinos services, which makes it a server. The PZP acts in place of the PZH, when there is no Internet access to the central PZH server. In order to act in its place, information, as already listed above, needs to be synchronised between the PZPs and the PZH. The PZP fulfills most, if not all of the functions of a PZH, when there is not PZH access. It sits between the webinos runtime environment and the PZH and receives user requests and gives responses locally to the user, if it can. In addition to the PZH proxy function, the PZP is responsible for all discovery using local hardware based bearers like Bluetooth, ZigBee, NFC (Near Field Communication), etc.. Unlike the PZH, the PZP does not issue certificates and identities. For optimisation reasons PZPs are capable of talking directly to each other, without routing messages through the PZH. While a PZH can reside in the Cloud or physically the user’s home network, each webinos enabled device has a PZP running on it. A PZP can be in the Cloud as well when there is a special case of "virtual PZP" providing cloud services such as an online contact list, calendar and so forth.

Figure 3 depicts the architectures for PZH and PZP. PZH and PZP talk with each other with JSON-RPC, which is set up over TLS sessions. As the PZH, the PZP stores authentication certificates, maintains context data, manages policies, and keeps a known user list. Both PZH and PZP have functions of messaging and routing, service discovery and synchronisation. PZP also has the function of peer PZP discovery.

### 2.3 Local connections

One of the features webinos provides is a unified local connection service based on physical proximity, by making the different interconnect technologies transparent. A webinos enabled device is able to find any supported interconnected other devices around it. The overlay network allows different applications and services to talk to each other over these different interconnect technologies, insulating appplication code from the underlying details. The webinos PZP enables applications to access services on other local webinos devices in the same Personal Zone, and also for services on non-webinos devices.

![]({width:500px}LocalConnection.png)
Figure 4: Local devices connected to a webinos enabled device

Figure 4 depicts the local connections around a webinos enabled device. Devices in an NFC area, a personal area network (PAN) or a local area network (LAN) are regarded local, no matter what kind of bearers they are using. Usually LAN devices have a full IP protocol stack and are running PZPs, thus are webinos enabled devices. Examples are PCs, Wi-Fi laptops, smart TVs and in-car units. NFC and PAN devices usually are not equipped with a full IP protocol stack and thus have no direct Internet access. There is no PZP running on those devices and they are regarded as non-webinos devices. More often, they are deemed as peripherals or peer devices providing some sort of point-to-point single hop networked services. Examples are USB keyboards, RFID tags, and smart phones connected via Bluetooth. They expose their services to the Personal Zone which can be used by the connected webinos enabled device.

The devices physically in the same local area may belong to different users and therefore logically be in different Personal Zones. That means the connection may be established across different Personal Zones and users can share services with each other.

### 2.4 Synchronisation

webinos provides synchronisation function based on rsync [RSNC]. It involves detecting and merging differences, and asking the user to resolve conflicts, taking into account periods of offline usage. The process involves a comparison of clocks as a basis for correcting for skews prior to comparing the time of each change. The approach is inspired by work on distributed revision control and 3 way merge algorithms for tree structured data. Synchronisation takes place when a device is enrolled into the Personal Zone or when changes occur. This is also coupled with local discovery, to enable a shared model of the context. For IP based networks, multicast announcements and query responses can be observed to update a local cache. Synchronisation and secure access to the context form a crucial part of the webinos platform. Browsers already support mechanisms for recording preferences and application specific local storage. Webinos can build upon this with additional database files held as part of the browser profile, and accessible from trusted code in browser extensions. Webinos may use JSON files to exchange synchronisation messages.

Synchronisation needs to function even when the device is operating with a subset of a Personal Zone, in absence of access to the Internet. This relies on being able to synchronise the devices in a peer to peer model. Synchronisation depends on being able to merge changes and to detect and resolve conflicting changes. If the context data model is independent, then one approach is to simply take the latest change to a particular part of the context. If the context data model has inter-dependencies, the updated model needs to satisfy the integrity constraints.

### 2.5 Policies

In webinos policies are written in an XML file. In this file it’s possible to specify multiple sets of policies: every set has a "combine" rule that is used to determine which policy shall be applied, e.g. with the "first-matching-target" combine rule, every request shall be matched against the first policy which matches the request’s target. The target of a policy could be users, applications, devices or combinations of them. Policies are expressed in the simplified XACML format defined in [BDAS] following the grammar provided by WAC. This format has been used as a basis in different specifications as from W3C DAP and WAC [WCDS].

Policy management is a service implemented within the PZP. The policy management service enforces privacy and access control requests and to manage the disclosure of user’s personal data and to control the access to the local device capabilities and features. This is done by matching the requests against written policies in order to determine to allow or deny the access to the requested resources.

3 Webinos on the device
-----------------------

A webinos enabled device, or webinos device in short, is a device with a PZP running on it, and usually a webinos Widget Runtime (WRT) environment for running webinos applications. The functional architecture of a webinos device is shown in Figure 5. In this figure, the webinos entities are installed as middleware on the device. Webinos applications run in the web browser or as a widget rendered on the native device OS.

![](WebinosEnabledDevice20120821.png)
Figure 5: webinos device

A webinos WRT is a special type of browser. It should be capable of rendering the latest JavaScript, HTML and CSS specifications. It is responsible for rendering the UI elements of the webinos application. As part of the WRT, a webinos root object is exposed as part of the global namespace for web page scripts, and provides the core set of webinos APIs as methods and properties to make use of the specific device capabilities, thus making the webinos application run across different device platforms. Via this root object, third party developers will be able to access the webinos functionality. A webinos WRT differs from a normal browser or web runtime in that all extended JavaScript functions, as well as some normal browser behaviour (such as XHR) must be mediated by the webinos policy enforcement layer. A webinos WRT will present environmental properties and critical events to the PZP so that it may process the security policy and contextual events correctly.

4 Webinos services and applications
-----------------------------------

### 4.1 Webinos services

For applications using it, a webinos service is a special webinos API. It provides a collection of functions and events that are accessible by a webinos application. These functions and events are always presented to the application developer as a set of JavaScript functions, no matter where the implementation resides. There exist the following types of webinos services:
* PZP hosted webinos APIs: APIs that can be accessed remotely by using JSON-RPC. The webinos API is hosted by a PZP and again access is mediated by a policy manager on the PZPs of both the caller and the provider.
* webinos applications providing APIs: an application is a webinos service if it presents external services as JavaScript APIs. The application service is made available through the PZP.

### 4.2 Binding, privacy and security

The webinos platform provides each device with a set of APIs for accessing services exposed directly by the Personal Zone. An example is the method used to discover services matching the given service type and context constraints. The method is asynchronous, and results in callbacks as service instances are discovered. Application developers can then provide a user interface (UI) for selecting between alternatives, where the list is dynamically updated as services become available or cease to be available. The approach allows application developers to offer users the means to obtain further information about each of the choices, as well as to record preferences for use in future situations.

The process of binding to a service (having first discovered it) involves:
* mutual authentication, where the zone authenticates the service, and the service authenticates the zone;
* secure communication through the use of cryptographic protocols, protecting against eavesdropping and man-in-the-middle attacks, spoofed IP addresses and spoofed DNS records;
* reviewing and granting the request by the service for elevated privileges.

Applications (or embedded services) can request elevated privileges. This is typically handled when the application first runs, and the user’s decision recorded for subsequent uses. Thus the applications are deemed as services and policies apply. The underlying model is that of notice and consent. The associated UI is provided by the webinos platform, and not by the applications. A further UI is provided to enable users to review and revoke decisions. The device itself may impose security policies, e.g. white listing which services may have particular privileges.

### 4.3 Extensibility

The webinos APIs are designed for extensibility. It is common to pass an object as an argument to a method where the object supports one or more interfaces. These interfaces are interpreted by third party components, and such third parties are also responsible for documenting the extensions. Web developers can call a standard QueryInterface method to cast an object to a named interface, when necessary to avoid name clashes.

Having been discovered and bound, a service is exposed as an object in the web page’s script execution environment. This object acts as local proxy for the service, which may be provided by a remote device. Webinos allows application developers to register a simple callback function, or to pass an object supporting a given interface, i.e. with a named method that is used as a callback.

### 4.4 Webinos applications

A webinos application runs "on device", where that device could also be Internet addressable, i.e. a server. A webinos application is packaged, as per packaging specifications, and executed within the WRT. A webinos application has access to security sensitive capabilities, mediated by the XACML file specific to the device’s policy manager component. A webinos application can expose some or all of its capability as a webinos service. An application developer is granted access to webinos capabilities via the webinos root JavaScript object.

Webinos applications may be downloaded and installed on devices, or they may be hosted by servers, with components that are dynamically downloaded when needed. Applications can make use of services, and in turn can provide services. Services may include a UI exposed as part of an application, e.g. within an HTML iframe element. The ability to combine and tailor services is used to support "mashups". Applications are essentially services that can be installed or bookmarked.

Webinos enables the local, client-side adaptation of the UI of an application based on the device characteristics. The adaptation process takes several of these characteristics into consideration, the most notable being screen size and resolution, device type and input modalities. To make this possible, applications will be created with a declarative UI description that is device-independent. This description will stay as close to the basic web technologies as possible. At runtime, this description is transformed into a HTML/CSS/JS layout suited for a web runtime.
