Git Installation
----------------

We use Git as version control system (instead of SVN). If you use Mac OS or Linux see "Using Git":http://dev.webinos.org/redmine/projects/wp-0/wiki/Using_Git.

### On Windows

1. Download and install "msysgit":http://code.google.com/p/msysgit/ - "link to installer":http://code.google.com/p/msysgit/downloads/list?q=full+installer+official+git
2. And download and install "TortoiseGit":http://code.google.com/p/tortoisegit/ which is a nice GUI for Git - "link to installer":http://code.google.com/p/tortoisegit/wiki/Download

Git usage
---------

This section explains very briefly the most basics things about Git. You are advised to read up on Git usage elsewhere there is lots of documentation around. Again, see "Using Git":http://dev.webinos.org/redmine/projects/wp-0/wiki/Using_Git as a starting point.

### Basic Usage (with TortoiseGit)

1.  **Clone** the remote master repository. The repository URL is `http://dev.webinos.org/git/t3-2.git`.
    Right-click in Windows Explorer to bring up the context menu in the directory where you want to clone the repository to. Select "Git Clone…" and fill in the remote repository URL and go. Use your Redmine login for authentication.

2.  Edit your user info. Right-click in Windows Explorer for the context menu in the directory of your local cloned repo and select "TortoiseGit" -> "Settings" and there "Git" -> "Config" and edit your name and email.

3.  Work on the Web IDL files. See the section on how to use widlproc further down on this page. Always remember to **pull** changes from the remote repository before making changes so that you always have the latest version of the files you are editing. It is **important** that everybody who commits makes absolutely sure that their edits leave **valid** widl files behind as otherwise the HTML generation wonâ€™t be successful. So make sure to run the webinos.sh script locally to test the HTML generation, see below.
4.  **Commit** your changes to your local repo. From the right-click context menu select "Git Commit -> master …". Add a message to describe your changes and click "OK".

5.  **Push** your changes from your local repo to the remote master. From the right-click menu select "TortoiseGit" -> "Push…" and in the following dialog hit "OK".

6.  **Pull** changes from the remote repository that others have made so your local repo is always in sync. From the right-click menu select "TortoiseGit" -> "Pull…" and in the following dialog hit "OK".

Repository contents
-------------------

The repository contains the whole tool chain used to generate HTML documentation from Web IDL (widl) files. WebIDL is a specification language to describe the the API interfaces, also used by the W3C.

All the sources for the generation are available in a directory in which three sub-directories are available:

-   sources:
    -   static: Where the static html, js or css files that compose the spec are stored.
    -   widl: Where the annotated WebIDLs are stored.
    -   resources: That contains the following files:
        -   win32: Directory for the widlproc executable that translates widls into xmls.
        -   macos: Directory for the widlproc executable that translates widls into xmls.
        -   linux: Directory for the widlproc executable that translates widls into xmls.
        -   widlprocxml.dtd: The DTD with the definition of the widl to xml translation.
        -   widlprocxmltohtml.xsl: An XSL to convert the XML generated from the widl to html.
-   webinos.sh: The shell script which generates the HTML documentation from the widl files.

Using widlproc
--------------

The tool is executed through the webinos.sh script that converts all the widls in the widl folder to htmls and copies them to a folder in which all the static resources (static folder) are also copied to. Right now the webinos.sh is a bash shell script so it needs the bash shell. Git for Windows (msysgit) includes bash, look for "Git Bash" in the start menu. Or you can install "Cygwin":http://www.cygwin.com/ which provides bash as well.

In order to execute it the following steps must be followed:

1.  Execute the script webinos.sh with two input arguments:
    1.  The folder in which all the sources are included (according to the structure defined in the previous section)
    2.  An existing folder in which a folder called apis will be generated in order to include all the specification there.

For instance, if the content of the zip file has been extracted in the /tmp folder, the command webinos.sh /tmp/sources /tmp/spec should generate the spec at /tmp/spec/apis.

Example:
<pre>
$ ./webinos.sh sources/ spec/
</pre>

If you get messages stating "xsltproc: command not found" on your local machine then simply install the missing package xsltproc (ubuntu: sudo apt-get install xsltproc).

WebIDL format
-------------

The tool is based on the "widlproc tool":https://github.com/dontcallmedom/widlproc which has extensive documentation about how should it be used and what is the format of the widl files to be processed.

If you use the "Vim":http://www.vim.org editor you can download a "syntax highlighting file for widl":http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=3634, which eases editing.
