20110330 conf call on User Identity Management
==============================================

Date: 30 Mar 2011
Time: 17:00 - 18:00 CEDT
Bridge: PowWowNow, _Enhanced Access_, PIN: 312806, "Dial-in numbers":http://pdf.powwownow.com/pdf/GBR_en_pwn-dial-in-numbers.pdf

Agenda:
* Architecture discussion
* Applying architecture on Nick’s use cases

Action Items:
* Sven: add use case on Facebook scenario
* DCM: use cases for the case that Facebook auth is already in place
* Polito: use case â€“ arch mapping: activity diagram with all the possibilities

Attendees:
* Andrea Atzeni (Polito)
* Steffen KrÃ¼ssel (DTAG)
* Sven Lachmund (DOCOMO)
* Christian Schaefer (DOCOMO)

Discussion:
* SAML should be default protocol but there is no need to limit to SAML only
**** If we find a more suitable protocol we can use it instead/in addition
* Facebook can be used for auth; this is why UR exists in the auth arch
* The user shall always have free choice to not use webinos auth for a given service if he likes
* User experience of choosing IDP during authentication
**** Automatic choice of provider? Policy controlled or by explicit selection by the user
* User could just authenticate with Facebook (FB) and FB provides token to webinos without that webinos knows the userâ€™s FB ID
**** User could also be found in webinos if they only have FB ID and mapping for pseudonyms would still be possible
**** Common webinos ID helps us making things easier this is why we will go for it in the design
**** Is it sufficient to have the webinos ID as optional ID (for the case user does not have a FB ID); revisit this question later when we know more details about the architecture and the other subtopics
* OpenID is contrary to the current webinos AA ideas
**** OpenID may be no longer maintained as it is not very successful currently; we tend to not using it

Next meeting: conf call on Mon 4 Apr 2011, 10:00 - 11:00 CEDT
