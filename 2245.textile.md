The W3C File API
----------------

### Overview of API

http://www.w3.org/TR/2011/WD-FileAPI-20111020/
http://www.w3.org/TR/FileAPI/

Provides read-only file objects representation.

### Threats

#### API-Specific threats and misuse cases

1.  This API could be used to access local files (read only) containing sensitive data.

This could be exploited, for example, by Harold, who develops a free and funny application which can provide the user a nice quote (from an external DB of quotes) chosen on the information present on the file system (e.g., retrieve the user name from the file system, and then look for quotes which contains the same name). To do so, the application access read the file system with the file API, whose behavior if not restricted allow access even to sensitive system sections (e.g. .webinos, where the private key is stored). Those private date can be sent outside during the exchange with the external quote database.

#### Threats based on remote invocation of this API from another device

1.  This API could be used to access remote files (read only) containing sensitive data.
2.  It may induce a false feeling in the user, which may assume that installing the application on one device limits what it can access to just that device, enabling access of sensitive information on other devices of the zone.
3.  It is also a case of minimising the surprise to the end user - they may assume that installing the application on one device limits what it can access to just that device.

#### Implementation threats and possible attacks

1.  Arguments are not validated, the Jimmy and Jessica have to provide by itself the proper validation.

#### Threats to apps and developers using this API (E.g. Jimmy and Jessica)

1.  Certain UAs, i.e., Browsers. In order to manage origin-private filesystems within webinos, additional information is required
2.  Encoding Subtleties: The W3C File API specification(http://www.w3.org/TR/FileAPI/) requires the IANA: Character Sets to be supported (http://www.iana.org/assignments/character-sets). Internally, JavaScript uses UTF-16; the implementation uses UTF-8 and currently ignores any given encoding. This direct manipulation have to pay attention to not introduce encoding mismatch.
3.  unproper data read by applications could contain malicious code, exploit bugs and enable bad application behaviour

#### Threats to device manufacturers, operators, other stakeholders

1.  it could be a first step (information leakage, device fingerprinting) for another threat which influence device reputation
2.  reading malicious code that enable bugs could provide root access or system crash

### Mitigations

1.  For developers threats, provide examples which clarify how the API works for each ambiguous case
2.  Each application could have a filesystem section devoted to its own files. File access outside this area should be denied. (This can be done via File API - Directories and System)
3.  Files (or application’s file system area) should be encrypted to avoid data disclosure to unauthorized readers.
4.  Files’ content should be parsed to avoid malicious code execution.

### Recommended default policy rules for applications

  ------------- ------------------------------------------------------
  _.Code   _.Type
  B-A           Browser-based, authenticated via TLS certificates
  W-R           Widget, authenticated using a recognised certificate
  W-U           Widget, unrecognised
