RPC and Messaging
=================

RPC
---

The functionality implemented for RPC is build on the top of the services discovered. So once services are discovered, they can use JSONRPC to invoke service. Services invoked could any other user device or other user device for which we have connected before.

RPC implemented is based on following specification: http://www.jsonrpc.org/specification.

Nothing specific to Webinos platform is done. All changes are specific to aid Webinos Service Discovery

Messaging
---------

RPC to communicate to PZH or PZP or browser uses messaging. The messaging functionality is to look for routing. It involves looking for registered PZH or PZP. Based on the session information it tries to find about connected PZH and PZPâ€™s. Various different addressing combination are used to find different paths for connected device. By default messages are forwarded to PZH if no route to PZP are found.

The other functionality of messaging preparing message that will be addressable. The message identifier, from, to, resp_to are added on top of the message. This allows message to be routed on different system.

Implementation specific: PZP or PZH or browser side gets registered with messaging. They register the sessionId, which is then used by messaging to find route. Once message appears in PZP or PZH and is not specific to PZH or PZP, it forwards it to messaging. Once messaging receives the message and it has added all fields it forwards message to PZP/PZH which holds socket information and routes the message.

Another messaging used in Webinos is PROP, these messages are used internally for communication between PZP and PZP.
