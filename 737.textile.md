-   HW Resource APIs: Device Interaction API missing. Stefano/TIM editor

IDL toolchain and Git
---------------------

Dominique Hazael-Massieux/W3C has updated widlproc to better match the current version of the Web IDL spec,including support for arrays. He has updated the binary in sources/resources/linux. However, the binaries for macOS or windows has not been updated. So, currently the HTML generation fails for people using windows or mac. As Nick provided the initial version of widlproc is was suggested that Nick should update the binaries for windows and mac. "Task 263":http://dev.webinos.org/redmine/issues/263

Claes suggested that the pages "Getting started with the source and tools from the Git repository":http://dev.webinos.org/redmine/projects/t3-2/wiki/Getting_started_with_the_source_and_tools_from_the_Git_repository
and "DL ToolChain instructions":http://dev.webinos.org/redmine/projects/t3-2/wiki/IDL_Tool_Chain_instructions are merged and that the contents is corrected and clarified where needed. For example, it is stated that Cygwin is needed to run the webinos.sh script frm windows. This is not needed as this script can be run from Git bash. "Task 264":http://dev.webinos.org/redmine/issues/264 on Alexander.

Specific issues:
----------------

### "Discovery and access to remote services":http://dev.webinos.org/redmine/projects/t3-2/wiki/Service_Discovery_API

No progress since Berlin. Franhofer, Samsung and SEMC (Anders) are willing to contribute but we have a lack of resources for the tangible widl API specification work. Claes to discuss with Anders and propose a way forward on this subject.

### "Application Execution APIs":http://dev.webinos.org/redmine/projects/t3-2/wiki/Application_execution_APIs

A set of APIs required are listed but what is most important and should tangible be provided for phase1? Resource situation?
Claes to discuss with Mikael and propose a way forward on this subject.

### APIs related to context awareness and adaption. Referring to discussion at WP3-call 11/5 (George Gionis)

Claes to contact George Gionis and propose a way forward on this subject.
