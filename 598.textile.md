Async API design — Introduction
===============================

This paper attempts to capture some of the motivations for asyncronous API design, some of the implications, and the interaction with policy files.

Background
==========

It was made a design goal within DAP and latterly WAC that any access to an API that was "security significant" should be made asynchronous.

The intent of this design decision, was to allow the UserAgent to present a option for the end user to give **informed consent** to this request, without blocking the execution of code.

State of the art
================

Current browsers already intercept security significant APIs and present these as asynchronous decision to the user through synchronous apis and event.

-   window.open() is, depending on the current browser policy, and how it is triggered, is blocked. An asynchronous indication is given to the user that a block has taken place. If the user **allows** the permission, the whole page refreshes
-   download of sensitive mimetypes. If the user encounters an unusual mimetype the browser usually offers to download the file. This option is typically presented asynchronously to the user for them to accept later.

Informed consent
================

The current design decision has at it heart an implicit assumption:

> Users **want to** and are **capable of** giving informed consent to application permission requests at run time

It is worth examining Google Chrome’s attitude to this problem

> On the other hand, if a web app repeatedly asks for permission, that’s a terrible user experience.

It is worth comparing googles example of **undesirable** bebaviour

With the W3C DAP example of behaviour.

Code readability
================

This subject takes into some fairly subjective areas, and touches on some fundamental philosophy or programming issues - so inevitably we will have some difference of opinions!

A good programming idiom should preserve **cognitive locality of reference**

In other words, on code inspection, frequency of code flow and intent of code flow should correlate with physical locality of code

Or in the words of http://www.infoq.com/articles/surviving-asynchronous-programming-in-javascript

> Programmers take certain features for granted - sequential programming for instance, writing down an algorithm that does one thing after the other.

However as they go onto say in their article

> However, if you’re writing code in Javascript that uses blocking I/O or other long running operations, sequential coding is out of the question because blocking the only thread in the system is a very bad idea. The solution is to implement algorithms using asynchronous callbacks, ie. spread out sequential code over multiple callbacks.
> That solves the problem but means we lose the ability to write down a sequential algorithm; instead for non-trivial sequential code, we end up with a graph of callbacks.
> This becomes even more critical for large scale applications that make heavy use of asynchronicity. Using callback-passing for asynchronous actions does not compose very well and might create complex flows of passing callbacks around to handle return values.
> The Javascript community is aware of this; particularly the Node.js community because Node.js puts an emphasis on asynchronous code.

In an ideal world

1.  Error handling should be dealt with non-locally, ie you follow the "intended" flow on inspection, and the "exceptional" is dealt with on an "exceptional" inspection of code
2.  Pending async should be dealt with non-locally, ie you see the algorithm as intended - even though there are pauses in execution

This issues is easily demonstrable looking at real code that uses the WAC BONDI file APIs

function downloadTrackResult(result, status, track) {
 showProgress("saving download");
 // Encoded file is in ‘result’ -> write it to file
 deviceapis.filesystem.resolve(
 function(dir) {
 dir.deleteFile(
 function() { createTrack(dir, track, result); },
 function() { createTrack(dir, track, result); },
 track + ".mp3");
 },
 function(e) { alert("error downloading: " + e.message); },
 "documents/metric/tracks",
 "rw");
 }

TBD : needs some better examples …..

To solve this tricky issue, we have one of two (non-mutually exclusive) options avialable to us

1.  keep the use of asynchronous APIs to the minimum
2.  make use of new idioms that allow for a better sequential presentation of asynchronous method calls

Performance
===========

There are two elements to the performance issue

1.  APIs that take a long time to return should be implemented as an asynchronous APIs
2.  Implementing APIs as asynchronous allows the script engine to better optimise and give better performance.

Point (1) is broadly true. It is further complicated by the webinos goal of highly distributed APIs and applications, the consequence of which many functions, could be implemented remotely and therefore subject to long, unanticipated delays. Also releven to this discussion is the concept of web-workers, or background scripts.

See
http://code.google.com/chrome/extensions/background_pages.html
http://dev.w3.org/html5/workers/

These are two subtly different techniques, but when used give a **get out** the assumption that all long lasting functions should be asynchronous.

Instead, we can use the working practice that ALL functions are implemented as synchronous , then based upon empirical deployment experience we move long lasting functions that interfere with UI to background processes.

Point (2) needs more investigation.

http://innoq.com/files/mic2010060080-novdec10.pdf

The basic theory is that a typical servers are implemented through multi-threading which impinges performance by requiring context switches. Whether this holds as true for client side script as server technology needs some more work based on empirical examples.

Alternative implementations/approaches
======================================

1.  Minimise async apis by making greater user of web-workers and background pages
2.  Minimise async APIs by stating that all apis that may fail due to **user permission** fail on first run through, but then if permission changes (ie if a user clicks ok on dialog) the whole page either receives
    1.  a policy change event notification
    2.  a complete page refresh

3.  do more investigation into different idioms for stacking up sequential (asycn) methods so that they preserve locality of presentation
