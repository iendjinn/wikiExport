API Analysis Methodology
------------------------

The API Security and Privacy analysis was carried out using the following methodology and process.

Several partners were invited to review APIs, either due to their security expertise or their involvement with the development of the API and therefore insights into potential threats. These partners included Telecom Italia, Polito, BMW F&T, Sony, and The University of Oxford. Most analysis data was reviewed by another partner before it was considered finished. Participants were invited to fill in the template given below while studying the API specification carefully. The template provided suggestions as to the personas, data sources and attack vectors to consider. Creativity was encouraged as part of this exercise.

The following two data sources were recommended:

-   The Mozilla WebAPI security analysis ([[D036_References#MozillaWebApi|MozillaWebApi]])
-   The related W3C / WAC / Other "security and privacy" sections of specifications

Once the process had concluded, the findings were conveyed as a series of recommendations and reported to the API developers and rest of the specification and implementation teams. At the time of writing, several recommendations are still under consideration.

Brief description of the API

#### Threats

##### API-Specific threats and misuse cases

1.  These are the obvious threats that misuse of this API could cause for users.
2.  I have elicited these by considering the assets that the API gives access to, as well as what happens if the API is excessively used.
3.  I have taken into consideration several personas.
4.  I have looked at the Mozilla approach for this/a similar API - ([[D036_References#MozillaWebApi|MozillaWebApi]]).
5.  I have taken into consideration any "security and privacy considerations" section of related specifications.

##### Threats based on remote invocation of this API from another device

1.  When this API is called from another device, what are the additional security concerns?
2.  When this API is called from another user on another device, what are the additional security concerns?

##### Implementation threats and possible attacks

1.  Based on my experience in implementation in phase 1, the following attacks might be possible…

##### Threats to apps and developers using this API (E.g. Jimmy and Jessica)

1.  How might a developer be caused harm by relying on this API?
2.  How might an app be damaged or attacked through this API?

##### Threats to device manufacturers, operators, other stakeholders

1.  How might other stakeholders be affected - for example, could it cause excessive traffic?

#### Mitigations

1.  How should the API be designed, implemented or constrained such that the threats are mitigated?
2.  Should the API be turned off by default?
3.  Should the API require authorisation always?
4.  Should the API result in some kind of notification or logging event?

#### Recommended default policy rules for applications

The following ‘types’ of application are supported in webinos:

  ------------- ------------------------------------------------------
  _.Code   _.Type
  B-A           Browser-based, authenticated via TLS certificates
  W-R           Widget, authenticated using a recognised certificate
  W-U           Widget, unrecognised
  ------------- ------------------------------------------------------

For each application type, one of the below API default policies is recommended. This applies to an application which explicitly requests access to this API.

  ------------ ------------ ------------ ----------------------------------- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- -- -- -- -- ------------------------------------- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ------------------------------------------------------------------
  _.B-A   _.W-R   _.W-U   _.Policy                       _.Explanation (Widgets)                                                                                                                             _.Explanation (Browser Apps)                                                                                                      Silently allow                        2. Applications will be granted access to this API without user consent being required. This can only be modified using a policy editor.
                                         Default allow (install time)        Widgets will need user consent at install time, but users will expect to allow it (the tick-box will automatically be filled in).                        Web pages will prompt for consent (Yes / No / Always) at runtime, this preference will be saved.
                                         Default ask at runtime (one-shot)   Widgets will require one-off user consent at runtime. This fact will be visible & modifiable at install time.                                            Web pages will prompt for consent (Yes / No / Always) at runtime, this preference will be saved.                                       Default ask at runtime (every time)   Widgets will require user consent at runtime, every time. This fact will be visible & modifiable at install time.
                                         Default deny (install time)         Widgets will require user consent at install time, but users will expect NOT to allow it (the tick-box will automatically be empty).                     Web pages will display a short notification at first-use saying that access was denied, with a button to change settings
                                         Silently deny                       2. Applications will not be granted access to this API, and users will not be asked at install time. This can only be modified using a policy editor.
  ------------ ------------ ------------ ----------------------------------- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- -- -- -- -- ------------------------------------- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ------------------------------------------------------------------

Several iterations of this table may exist if the API provides distinctly different methods or permissions.
