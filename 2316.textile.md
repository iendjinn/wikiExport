Content Adaptation - XUL (in progress)
======================================

What is XUL
-----------

XUL is a user interface markup language developed by Mozilla. Being a dialect of XML it is of course cross-platform.

Pros
----

-   allows separation of data from the presentation layer via RDF files
-   mature (over 10 years)
-   the XUL itself is easy to learn
-   ability to test the app without installing any additional software except for firefox (at least in theory - I had some issues with that and xulrunner alone)

Cons
----

-   the need to learn not only XUL but possibly also RDF, and maybe XPCOM (not counting XHTML and JS)
-   on top of that - serious lack of tutorials (or outdated ones)
-   XULrunner (from Mozilla) required to interpret the language is a 16M package

Frameworks using XUL:
---------------------

-   "AmpleSDK":www.amplesdk.com - JS-based framework giving various extensions and polyfills BUT concentrating on desktop, and not mobile development

Why it could be actually counterproductive to use XUL (or previously suggested XDIME)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

While those languages in itself are solid, ripping them apart from the proprietary interpreters (XULrunner and MCS respectively, the first being desktop apps oriented, and the second one being a server-side technology) enforces us to write our own solutions, while not giving us any substantial advantage over HTML 5 - which is already widely supported and possibly optimized as it can be on a given device.
