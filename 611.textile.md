User ID and Data Management Discussion
======================================

This page is the right place for discussing and technical details, questions, issues, hurdles and more which are related to user identity and user data management.

Instructions
------------

Please use a second level headline (h2) for each new item you wish to discuss.

Please explain under this headline the item and put the questions there.

If you want to comment on an item of another person, just go to the end of the item (right before the next headline starts), put your first name, followed by a colon and add your comment.

Over time we’ll have a chronologically sorted discussion ordered by the titles of the items which are the headings.

If you prefer placing your comment into the forum, please link the forum entry here on this page in order to be complete here. We should avoid spreading items through different sites.

Let’s have an active discussion!

Worth a read: "A Microsoft Perspective on Anonymous Credentials":http://www.trust2010.org/slides/Bjones.pdf - covers problems with centralised IdP.

A possible reusable component: "Identity Mixer (idemix) is an anonymous credential system developed at IBM Research that enables strong authentication and privacy at the same time.":http://idemix.wordpress.com/ . It might be useful for using credentials issued by the IdP in a privacy-preserving way. Failing that, it might be useful for logging into the IdP in the first place. See "scenarios":http://idemix.wordpress.com/scenarios/ .

Open Issues (as of 14 April 2011)
---------------------------------

Compiled from our conf calls and Polito’s architecture document. We should come up with decisions on these issues ASAP.

1.  How to register users?
2.  Registering devices of a user mutually (i.e. how are new devices of a user introduced to the other devices and the other way round)
3.  Distribution of group keys
4.  User authentication with external IDP (e.g. Facebook)
    -   How does webinos know that the user authenticated towards Facebook in the browser? â€“ There is a JavaScript API which tells this

5.  How to identify users and devices (pub-key, URI, â€¦)?
6.  Do we prefer a temporary local IDP in offline case or a local data cache (no service)?
    -   If we have a local IDP it should be a Web server in order to reuse the same technologies and protocols

7.  One central IDP or local IDPs per user on one of their devices?
8.  Do we need a registrar? See also [[User_ID_and_Data_Management_Discussion#Issues|Issues]] below.
9.  How do applications specify their requirements for authentication and identity? E.g. how do they state that they need the user to be "logged in"? We need to walk-through some examples and work out what happens when users have multiple identities or want to remain mostly anonymous.
10. Should the app request and get credentials or is it webinos which does all the identification and authentication under the hood?
11. How to authenticate users on devices with limited UI or on devices which are used by multiple people (e.g. TV)?
    -   Mobile phone could be the primary device. User has to confirm activities which require user authentication on his mobile phone
    -   Limited device (e.g. TV) can have an easy-to-use authentication facility (e.g. a finger print reader)

Identity Providers, Offline functionality and Synchronisation
-------------------------------------------------------------

This area is for summarising the recent discussion on how devices identify each other offline, the role of an external Identity Provider (IDP) in managing your "local cloud" and how these things are synchronised. Interaction with the [[Policy_Cross_Device|Policy Management Synchronisation area]].

Current proposal is to have policy fragments and trust relationships stored locally on each device. These are stored in a version-controlled distributed repository (such as git - "example":http://blog.bomgardner.org/37089258) where changes can be made and propagated to other devices. In an online mode, an IdP might keep a subset of this information (perhaps just a list of discoverable devices, for example).

Modifications required: updates to a version-controlled object would need to be issued in an authenticated manner. E.g. Signed SAML assertions? How to coordinate updates would also be an issue, as well as resolving conflicts.

[[User_ID_Synchronisation_Thoughts]]

Combination of User ID Management, User Data Management and Discovery — the Big Picture
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Proposals of how the entire work flow of discovering devices, managing identities and accessing services can look like. This is to be agreed by the other subtopic working groups, of course.

-   [[User ID and Data Management Discussion proposal 1|proposal 1]]: Personal Zone Proxy on the local network and central webinos WebFinger server on the Internet
-   [[User ID and Data Management Discussion proposal 2|proposal 2]]: **_discouraged and discontinued!_** involvement of central Identity Provider (IDP) on the network without registrar
-   [[User ID and Data Management Discussion proposal 3|proposal 3]]: Webinos Authentication Provider (WAP) for single sign-on (SSO) with publicly accessible services on the Internet

Usability is very important. Thus devices should always discover all the others belonging to the same user and establish a secure connection. Services of the devices are then just available to the user at any time if the devices are accessible (due to existence of network connectivity). This is why the list of devices per user is required. We believe the if this list is centrally maintained by the IDP or the Registrar, synchronisation is easier than in the case where each device just has its own copy.

### Features of the Components

Identity Provider (IDP)
* authenticates the user before providing any identification and SSO services to the user
* Performs single sign-on (SSO) among webinos-enabled devices and between a webinos-enabled device and third party service
* performs attestation of the user in cases where authenticity of the user and/or of messages of the user need to be proven
* manages group keys
* Issues pseudonyms
* Provides partial identities for users (e.g. "over 18 years old", "currently located in Germany")
* issues any new identifier for users, devices, services, apps which are unique in the namespace of the IDP
**** There can be any number of IDPs; combination of ID and domain name of the IDP turn all IDs into globally unique IDs
* manages mapping of user identities and identities of all devices/services/apps of that user (if there is no registrar)
* synchronises user data with the devices of this user for the purpose of offline usage
**** data about a user which is to be accessible by the user all the time is synchronised with and cached on all webinos devices belonging to this user

-   Properties
    -   there is an arbitrary number of IDPs
    -   each user is registered with exactly one webinos IDP (but in addition, users can be registered with any number of IDPs of other providers (e.g. Facebook))

-   Note on terminology: the IDP in the discussion here may comprise the functionality of the WAP of the authentication Architecutre.

Registrar
* User registers those of their own devices which are currently online
* maps user identifiers to device identifiers
* some or all the functionality of the registrar could be performed by the IDP in order to only have one entity

Local Data Cache (LDC)
* stores identifiers of the user
* stores a list of all the devices owned by the user
* synchronised with online user data store when connected to the Internet
* also part of the policy management architecture - synchronises cross-device policies.

### Questions for Discovery Sub-Topic Group

  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  {background:#ffdfdf}. Please discuss these questions **only** in the "Forum":http://dev.webinos.org/redmine/boards/7/topics/20. There you can reply to each question individually! That helps us structuring the discussion.
  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1.  We intend to introduce the Identity Provider (IDP) in webinos. Among others (see [[User_ID_and_Data_Management_Discussion#Features-of-the-Components|Features of the Components]] above), it will provide a mapping of user identity to device identity by maintaining a list of all the devices which belong to the user. This can be used by the discovery subgroup for identity resolving from user to device. Is this beneficial for discovery?
2.  What are the favoured ways of device discovery?
    1.  Do clients broadcast their existence? Do they reveal their identity thereby?
    2.  Do services/applications broadcast their existence?
    3.  Is the user asked for permission on response to a discovery request (for preserving privacy)?
    4.  How can devices be visible during discovery for a certain set of other devices only (e.g. only for a user’s own devices)?
    5.  Is there encrypted message exchange during discovery for privacy reasons (prevent disclosure of identities)?
    6.  Can the discovery process distinguish own devices from all other devices?

3.  Does each discovery attempt always reveal the identity of a device?
4.  Can anyone conclude the identity of the user once the identity of one of the userâ€™s devices is known?
5.  Do we have/need a registrar where the user registers the devices which are currently online and where the user can be currently reached?
    1.  Note for clarification: see the two proposed activity diagrams at the beginning of [[User_ID_and_Data_Management_Discussion#Combination-of-User-ID-Management-User-Data-Management-and-Discovery-the-Big-Pcture|this section]]
    2.  Without registrar we just try to reach all the devices mapped to the user and see which one responds.

6.  Is it irrelevant which device is to be accessed to access a certain service since we just discover the service and this discovery tells us which device to contact? Or do we query devices for their capabilities?
    1.  Note for clarification: with _service_ I refer to functionality which is offered by a device. This can for instance be the media gallery which a device of a user exposes to the outside. The same user with another device or another user with their own device can than access this gallery. The gallery is actually a Web server which provides the functionality.

7.  Do we distinguish the 4 cases as described in my "initial presentation on IDM at the Torino meeting":http://dev.webinos.org/redmine/attachments/491/110221_WP3.1_IDM_initial_Turin.pptx on slides 4 and 5?
8.  We should ensure that identifiers of users, devices, services and apps are as similar as possible
    1.  candidates are: URI, public keys, …
    2.  Is it beneficial to address users/devices by cryptographic identifiers (e.g. public keys)?

9.  Discovery can be costly in terms of power consumption, computation and time. What about limited devices?

### Issues

-   Do we need a registrar? There is no need for registering devices, but it may allow for more efficient communication.
    -   If devices are registered, devices would directly access those devices of another user which are online, see [[User ID and Data Management Discussion sequence diagram A|sequence diagram A]]
    -   If devices are not registered, devices would try all the devices on the list of a user in order to find one which is online and which provides the desired service, see [[User ID and Data Management Discussion sequence diagram B|sequence diagram B]]
    -   Is it irrelevant which device is to be accessed to access a certain service since we just discover the service and this discovery tells us which device to contact? Or do we query devices for their capabilities?
    -   Registrar might become a very trusted party, and therefore a target for attack. How do we trust it?
    -   The [[Device_Discovery_High_Level_Architecture#Terminology-and-Scope|Device Discovery High Level Architecture]] suggests that there is a registrar.

-   The IdP may become too trusted an entity. How do we avoid making it a target for attack? What can we do to limit its value as a target?

Interfacing of IDP in webinos with external authentication services (e.g. Facebook)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

How does webinos know that the user authenticated towards Facebook in the browser? â€“ There is a JavaScript API which tells this when being called. If there is a session in the browser with Facebook, other applications can access Facebook functionality via this session. Details:
* "Facebook JavaScript API Reference":http://developers.facebook.com/docs/reference/javascript/
* "Facebook REST API for Authentication":http://developers.facebook.com/docs/authentication/

Interfaces to Policy Management
-------------------------------

The main caveat for Identity Management and Discovery is to preserve unlinkability between certain identifiers and the corresponding users.
Apart from that, we came across some issues during our discussions which we would like to share with the Policy Management sub-topic group.

### Information and Questions for Policy Management Sub-Topic Group

1.  Discovery call should be intercepted by policy mechanism as this is security/privacy critical (Nick)
2.  Local Data Cache (LDC) on the devices is synchronised with online user data store (provided by the IDP) when connected to the Internet. Policy management can use this to distribute and synchronise cross-device policies

Questions for Overlay Network Sub-Topic Group
---------------------------------------------

In order to adjust the authentication architecture design properly, we have the following questions:

1.  How does addressing work on the webinos overlay network?
2.  Which features/guarantees does the overlay network provide (e.g. establishing a secure communication channel)?
