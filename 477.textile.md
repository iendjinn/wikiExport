Policy Architecture
===================

Where do all components fit together?

Back-link to the [[Policy_Management|Policy Management main page]].

Requirements referring to the architecture of Policy Management
===============================================================

-   [[Selection of architectural requirements from D2.2]]
-   [[Components with architectural requirements and notes]]

Notes
-----

-   It would be nice to integrate Obligation policies from PRIME - http://spdp.dti.unimi.it/papers/wisg09-ADPPS.pdf
-   Where does context fit in? What about the Policy Information Point?
-   Access Negotiation within XACML Architecture - http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.118.7718&rep=rep1&type=pdf

Single Device Structure
=======================

-   Simple XACML-like architecture

<div class="uml">

WebinosRuntime o— DeviceAPIs
WebinosRuntime o— PEP
WebinosRuntime o— LocalData
WebinosRuntime o— Comms
WebinosRuntime o— Apps

Apps --> PEP

PEP--> LocalData
PEP --> Comms
PEP--> DeviceAPIs

PEP "1" - "1" PDP
PDP "1" - PAP
PAP "1" — "*" XACMLPolicy

</div>
Multi-Device Distributed Structure
==================================

-   Added PDPC, PIP and PAP communication with webinos network (Problem: synchronization)

A rough sketch:

Distributed Architecture Based on PrimeLife (XACML+PRIME extensions)
====================================================================

-   Similar to the distribuited XACML-like version proposed above, but integrated in a PrimeLife architecture
-   Introduction of DHDF for data-handling policies
-   Introduction of some abstraction components (Decision Wrapper, Data Reader)
-   Intrduction of Credential System

Motivations behind this choice:
-------------------------------

-   Negotiation (PIP indentifying missing attributes needed, incremental evalutation of access control policies, minimal disclosure)
-   Credential-based restrictions (digital credential and certified attributes)
-   Data-handling policies (in addition to the traditional XACML access control policies), e.g. privacy policies defined user-side, privacy level handling
-   Legislation support (EU privacy directives)
-   Open-source European Project

Flow description and assumptions
--------------------------------

Access requestor: the entity requesting access to a resource

Personal Zone Proxy (PZP): in this context the PZP acts in four ways
- enforces authorization decisions at device level
- synchronizes request context data with other devices
- synchronizes PDP policies with other devices
- verifies credentials towards the request context

Decision wrapper: responsible for driving the access control policy evaluation and enforcement

Access manager: the entity in charge of taking the final decision by combining the XACML access
control and the DHDF data.

PEP: the entity that performs access control, by making decision requests and enforcing
authorization decisions

Obligations: operations specified in a policy that should be performed by the PEP in conjunction
with the enforcement of an authorization decision

Context handler: the system entity that converts decision requests in the native request format
to the XACML canonical form and converts authorization decisions in the XACML canonical form
to the native response format

PDP: the entity that evaluates applicable policy and renders an authorization decision

PIP: the entity that acts as a source of attribute values

Data reader: responsible for abstracting the communication with the Request Context

Request context: responsible for managing all contextual information; it stores all the data and
credentials released by a user in a given session

DHDF engine: Data Handling Decision Function engine provides privacy and data handling functionalities.
It does not implement a complete privacy-aware access control system, but rather it is responsible for
the management and evaluation of data handling policies only

Personal Zone Hub (PZH): in this context the PZH acts in three ways:
- as a data synchronizer towards the request context (via PZP)
- as a policy synchronizer towards the PDP (via PZP)
- as a credential system (responsible for credential verification) towards the request context (via PZP)

0. PZP update policies and make them available to the PDP
1. The access requestor sends an access request to the PZP
2. The PZP sends the request for access to the decision wrapper
3. The decision wrapper forwards the request towards the access manager, together with the possible relevant
data handling policies attached to the requested resources

XACML engine branch
{
 4. The access manager forwards the request to the PEP
 5. The PEP forwards the request to the context handler
 6. The context handler constructs an XACML request and sends it to the PDP
 7. The PDP requests any additional attributes from the context handler.
 8. The context handler requests the attributes from a PIP
 9. The PIP asks the data reader for requested attributes
 10. The PIP obtains the requested attributes
 11. The PIP returns the requested attributes to the context handler
 12. The context handler sends the requested attributes to the PDP which evaluates the policy
 13. The PDP returns the authorization decision to the context handler
 14. The context handler translates the response to the native response format of the PEP and returns
 the response to the PEP
 15. The PEP fulfills the obligations
 16. The PEP returns the access decision to the access manager
}

Privacy enhanced branch
{
 a. The access manager forwards the request and the Data Handling Policies to the DHDF engine
 b. The DHDF engine asks the data reader for evaluation information
 c. The DHDF engine obtains information needed for evaluation
 d. The DFDH engine evaluated DH policies and returns the decision to the access manager
}

17. The access manager combines the XACML access control decision and the DHDF data handling decision,
 then it sends the result to the decision wrapper.
18. The decision wrapper forwards the result to the PZP which enforces it.

Open issues
===========

Where and how are policies stored on each device (BONDI)
--------------------------------------------------------

[From section 6.2.2 of BONDI Architecture and Security v1.1]:
â€œThe requirements here are based on the assumption that a device has a locally stored Security Policy, which is made up of one or more separately configurable fragments, each in BONDI XML security policy format. No structure is imposed by BONDI at this release on the partitioning of complete Security Policies into fragments.â€
