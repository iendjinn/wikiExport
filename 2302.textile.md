Personal Zone API and Use Cases
===============================

Author: Habib Virji

Changes: During development of webinos, the set of standardized API’s were identified to find about current device where application is running and other personal zone devices. These API’s aim to provide the information about device identity, remote identity finding and primary identity selection.

Overview
--------

Jessica is a developer of webinos application and wants to access different identities provided by webinos platform. The details shared should take care of being agnostic about the platform physical storage location and physical identifier. They return static identifier which cannot be used for connecting device. These are logic identifiers which user interacts with. These API’s are to facilitate programmer and are accessible only on the same device. These API’s cannot be called by application running on another device. This API is intended to provide programmer device information and device type on which it is running to adapt the application logic. It also facilitates logging support and application storage support.

Description
-----------

Jessica is developing a webinos application that runs on different platforms. She needs a API functionality to find device on which application is running. She intends to use the services on same device or use devices from the same personal zone. Jessica since she is trying to develop an application and does not know what each user policies are, he needs application to adapt behavior as per device and adapt logic accordingly. For example, when she is using Messaging API he would like to check whether it is Mobile Phone. In case she is using geo-location, she can try to check if it is PC, Mobile or Vehicle and write code and logic where to use service accordingly.

As webinos is a cross-platform she needs identifier to distinguish between devices and application, as it was noticed during developing of WP5 applications. FindService returns set of location where service are hosted but it is not possible to know which is its own device, which is other device and what is current application identity. The application identity is needed for example to subscribe for event. All these information will facilitate application developer of webinos to develop cross platform application.

### Proposed API functionality

1.  Get Session Identifier: This includes application id, device(PZP) id, own PZH id.
2.  Get Device Status: Online and offline status of personal zone devices.
3.  Get Device Type: Classifying device type as either Mobile, PC, TV, Vehicle or M2M.
4.  Store application data: Application data needs to typically store data about application data. This API will provide a way to store but not provide information where information is stored. This should also allow user to choose his own storage location.
5.  Retrieve application data: Retrieve in where application data stored.
6.  Logging Mechanism: While developing, developer could subscribe for logging to get details about platform working and whether application is getting response back.

Issues
------

-   Exposing API information, could be passed by developer in his implementation to other devices. For example, Jimmy could pass PZP’s information in his implementation to other PZH’s, which is not the intention of this API.
-   Privacy issue as we give away information and this could leave fingerprinting

Benefits
--------

Major benefit is programmer developing an application on small device can adjust application accordingly. This information will allow them to differentiate logic for different devices and find device to which they communicate.
