Authentication proposal
=======================

Background
----------

How do we manage shared devices? This question was raised by John in a recent email:

<pre>
Something that keeps bothering me is how users are authenticated before
a policy is known to apply to them.

Often, users will only be authenticated through possession of the device
and its corresponding private key. However, on shared devices this will
probably **not** be sufficient to identify them fully. Helen could be
using Justin’s TV, for example.

A higher level of authentication can be captured through login to the
PZH with an OpenID. But we don’t want to make this compulsory.

The problem is that a policy saying "Justin can access the Camera API on
Peter’s car" doesn’t make any distinction between the levels of
authentication. Do we require Justin to have authenticated with the PZH?
Or do we just require the request to have come from Justin’s personal
zone? Or should Justin then authenticate with **Peter’s** PZH, again?

Can we express this kind of thing in policies - going back to an
intra-zone example - can we say "Justin can access the File API from all
of his devices" or are we always going to need to say "Justin can access
the File API from device A, B and C" (e.g. his trusted single-user
devices) AND "Justin can access the File API from device D, E and F, but
only is he re-authenticates"? Do we need to have two users - "Justin’s
devices" and "Justin", with "Justin" being only for when he has been
authenticated with his PZH?

This seems to be a gap in our specification.

Threats and Risks.
------------------

What could go wrong? What are the likely scenarios?

### Misuse cases

-   Alice’s TV could be used by one of her guests to access private photos held on her mobile phone.
-   Peter and Georg might be friends, and Georg has a policy saying that Peter can use the File API. However, Gary, Peter’s disgruntled colleague, has borrowed Peter’s tablet PC and begins searching through Georg’s files.
-   Georg’s children are automatically given access to Georg’s mobile phone contacts through his TV, and start making prank phone calls to his business colleagues.
-   Clara’s friend Justin is able to access Clara’s personal zone. However, Justin doesn’t use webinos for anything particularly important, and Clara does. As a result, Justin is careless with his webinos policies, and allows his friends to use his webinos-enabled TV whenever they are in his house, and browse what he has available. They are able to access Clara’s camera, location and media files.
-   Alice has an affair with Georg, and they spend several evenings sharing media and watching TV shows from both of their personal zones. Alice sets a policy allowing Georg to access all of her media files from any of his devices. Unbeknownst to Alice, Georg is married, and his wife (with whom he shares a TV and laptop) is suddenly able to access all of Alice’s devices.
-   Clara shares a TV with her parents. The TV is in her mother’s personal zone. She’s having some friends over, and they all use the TV to connect to their parent’s personal zone devices too…

### Notes

-   It is not unreasonable for people to grant quite broad, permissive policies when communicating between devices. For instance, Clara and her friends might be very trusting and use sharing of personal zones as a form of social currency.
-   In many of these scenarios, users would like to grant broad access to a person to access their personal zone. However, the notion of "person" is too vague - any shared devices breaks the model.
-   Different people may have different privacy or access control values for their personal zones. When these collide, there is a problem, as allowing your friend access to your personal zone effectively allows all of his/her acquaintances (with access to his/her devices) to access the personal zone.

-   We’re worried about implicit authentication resulting in unauthorised access.
-   This is mostly a problem when access is from a remote location, when a device is used out of context. E.g., Bob’s TV is authorised to access Alice’s mobile device, and Alice can’t see Bob’s TV to manage it.

-   We need a better definition of ‘self’. When Alice says that ‘Justin’ can access certain APIs, she doesn’t mean "Justin and all of Justin’s friends nearby", she really means "Justin".

Ideas
-----

-   Offload as much as possible to the OS - rely on it to distinguish users. Make use of the authentication API where possible.
-   Mandatory re-authentication. Introduce a new, local-level password.
-   Identify the "user" and the "user’s devices" as different concepts in the policy. Make this distinction clear to users?
-   If Alice and Bob are communicating, Alice has the choice to require Bob to authenticate to HER PZH.
-   Have an enrolment process when installing a PZP, which asks the user whether or not to ‘bless’ a key with further status…

Potential hierarchy of authentication, with (1) being most trustworthy:

1.  Alice (authenticated via OpenID to Bob’s PZH)
2.  Alice (authenticated via OpenID to Alice’s PZH, hosted by a known provider)
3.  Alice’s personal device (e.g. never multi-user) + use of the Authentication API to indicate local authentication
4.  Alice’s personal device (e.g. never multi-user)
5.  Alice’s device (may have multiple users) + user of Authentication API to indicate local authentication
6.  Alice’s device (may have multiple users)
7.  Unknown

Do some of the less-trustworthy levels put a greater requirement on live revocation checks? E.g. if it’s just Alice’s device, should we check revocation status before trusting it?

There seem to be a significant number of variables:

-   Local device key
-   Local device authentication status
-   Local device type
-   OpenID authentication status
-   Device revocation status

Proposed solutions
------------------

### Two device contexts

-   Have two types of device context - "private" and "shared". "Private" devices have their private key strongly associated with the person, whereas "Public" devices only use the key to identify the device.
-   When setting policies, a policy that speaks about the user only refers to private devices automatically.
-   When the end user tries to access something from a shared device, it require re-authentication.
    -   Considering that most misuse cases appear to involve remote access, rely on re-authentication through openid to the PZH.
    -   An alternative would be to use local device authentication. However, I’m concerned that in many cases this either doesn’t exist, or might be unexpected.
-   This default policy can be overridden - you can define that one device always has access to something without re-authentication.

TODO: We need to spend more time trialling the OpenID login. There may be unexpected effects, particularly if we over-use it. Logging in to authenticate for something minor should not persist as authentication of the user for other actions. This might result in misuse. Ideally, we need to associate the OpenID login with the device in use - that means installing keys into the browser.

The problem this **doesn’t** solve is Justin knowing the level of authentication Peter has. I suggest:

-   When Justin sets a policy about Peter (with no device specified) it means that Peter must, by default, always re-authenticate online to Justin’s personal zone.
-   However, Justin can also make the policy wider (user interface needed) to specify that some of Peter’s devices are trusted to not have to authenticate. But by default, none are.
-   Peer-to-peer interactions seem a little different. With these, there’s much less chance of misuse, as it will usually be the case that Peter and Justin are in proximity. The connection should, by default, require Justin to approve a peer-to-peer connection made by Peter. Again, it ought to be possible to specify that this isn’t necessary in some cases… the peer-to-peer scenario needs more work.
