Service Discovery and Service Binding
-------------------------------------

### Anders introduction

-   First draft API reflecting the "Access to remote API session" in Berlin. "Service Discovery API ":http://dev.webinos.org/specifications/draft/servicediscovery.html
-   Dom has provided a "code example/prototype of this API":https://listen.fokus.fraunhofer.de/sympa/arc/webinos-wp3-ml/2011-05/msg00076.html.

### Zone id /user id as input or selected by user and Success Callback.

Refer to e-mail discussion between Anders and Dom: https://listen.fokus.fraunhofer.de/sympa/arc/webinos-wp3-ml/2011-05/msg00103.html and https://listen.fokus.fraunhofer.de/sympa/arc/webinos-wp3-ml/2011-05/msg00105.html

No yet a conclusion on way to define user id etc but Anders will adjust API based on comments from Dom and Victor.

Should we have a Success callback for each service discovered? Or should we have one callback that returns when the user has selected the service to use meaning that the API implementation builds the selection list. The latter is simpler for the delevloper but not as flexible. discovery and bind in one call? There were no objections to have just one callback. We can also have support both ways by having the success callback for each service discovered and additionally create a synchronous method through a JS lib.

### Filter Interface

Currently empty. Which vocabulary should we used? Vicor suggests LDAP filters (RFC 4515: Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP): String Representation of Search Filters (see http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4515). There are implementations in open source supporting both LDAP formats and data base. But we don’t need to use the LDAP data base.

**Conclusion:** Use the LDAP approach as a starting point.

### Victors input

See "Service discovery API wiki page (updated by Victor Klos)": http://dev.webinos.org/redmine/projects/t3-2/wiki/Service_Discovery_API

Vicor suggests that the components in the class diagram at "Class diagram ":http://79.125.104.127/redmine/projects/t3-2/wiki/Service_Discovery_API#Class-diagram should be reflected in the API. Please also review "Some more cool constructs". Good ideas but Anders thinks this might go out of service discovery and is not sure we will have time to support this before deadline end of June. We can continue to evolve this in phase 2 of APIs (WP 3.2). However, Victor stressed the importance to provide intersting functionality to developers.

**Conclusion:** Anders to continue to evolve the API based on comments from Dom and Victor.

### Event handling - Stefano

"Event handling wiki": http://79.125.104.127/redmine/projects/t3-2/wiki/Informal_low_level_event_handling_API_attempt

Introduction by Stefano.

- Low level API, not sure if application developers should use it but for those implementing services, i.e. "Webinos internal" and building block for higher level stuff.
- Maybe for phase 2
- The high level is the Service Discovery/Bind API
- Anders: Forward event? Stefano: Inspired by XMPP publication system.
- Victor: Looks XMPP like, use instead of XMPP or on top of XMPP? Stefano: Don’t know.
- Anders: We should be agnostic to underlying protocol for event exchange. Suggest a small and simple API as starting point.
- Victor: We should limit the scope to IP.
- Anders: This needs to be discussed within Webinos.

Two alternatives:

1.  Tangible Event handlng Widl API specification for WP 3.2 delivery.
2.  Stefano’s wiki only as informative statement on a general structure of a low level event handling API for WP 3.2 delivery.

However, after the meeting Anders and Claes discussed a third alternative that is a simplified event API that only supports addEventListener, removeEventListener, dispatchEvent as a tangible Event handlng Widl API specification for WP 3.2 delivery. This has earlier been proposed by Andre according to http://79.125.104.127/redmine/issues/259.
**So, could Stefano and Andre coordinate on this and also coordinate with Anders on relation with Service discovery.**
