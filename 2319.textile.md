Content Adaptation: joshfire framework (in progress)
====================================================

to be found at http://framework.joshfire.com

What does it have to offer
--------------------------

-   JavaScript framework
-   clear separation of data from UI (Data Tree, which is also sort of a router from what i reckon; and UI Tree, where you declare components and bind them to data sources)
-   underscore.js templates
-   event driven; callbacks
-   native [not 100% sure on that] or at least aimed-at-a-specific-device components (for example iScroll) via adapters: "For instance playing a video can be made with the HTML5 <video> element in some browsers, with Flash in older browsers, with Java on Android and with vendor-specific APIs on connected TVs."
-   "Write once, run everywhere" philosophy with more adapters planned

Adapters
--------

-   Currently supported adapters:
    -   Web Browsers
        -   Internet Explorer 6+
        -   Firefox 3.5+
        -   Chrome latest public version
        -   Safari 5+
        -   Any other standards-compliant browser
    -   Mobiles and tablets
        -   iOS 3.0+
        -   Android 2.2+
    -   TVs
        -   Samsung TVs and blu-ray players, SDK 2.3+
        -   Google TV
    -   Headless environments
        -   Node.js: Share code between the server and the client.
        -   Arduino: Control apps from hardware through Arduinos and websockets.

-   Experimental adapters
    -   Kinect: Provides either fake mouse pointer bound to nearest finger or generic gestures. Prototype based on DepthJS, must port to newer SDKs.
    -   Sencha: More complete but slower than our iOS/Android adapters. May be useful for some advanced UI elements, but beware of performance and licensing terms.

Possible shortcomings
---------------------

-   **"The Joshfire framework uses PhoneGap to compile your JavaScript app into a native iOS app." - not sure if this can be avoided, or is this a standard thing when using adapters**
-   use of iScroll - Android 4 and forms issues, also: "One-finger scrolling on smartphones is currently done with JavaScript. Even if in a few years most smartphones will support it natively via CSS, it is still one of the biggest potential pitfalls for a HTML5 application on smartphones. To improve performance in these lists, you should try to keep their DOM as simple as possible"
-   "Currently the framework has very good support for "content-based" applications, including text, audio and video browsing. Depending on user need, future releases may focus on form input and other areas."
-   still quite young and the development seems to have stalled (as of July 19th 2012 - version 0.9.2 is downloadable, with 0.9 being the first public version out in June 29th 2011),
