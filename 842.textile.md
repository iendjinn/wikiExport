Personal Zone Security
----------------------

### Introduction

The Personal Zone is a grouping of devices for the purposes of managing the devices and associated services belonging to a given person. The zone appears to each device as a set of local APIs. There is also a zone hub that is accessible on the public Internet and which serves as an access point to the zone from the Internet.

This section will cover the security aspects of the mechanisms needed for:

* authenticating the user to the zone
 * authenticating a device to the zone
 * authenticating the zone to an application
 * synchronizing context across the zone
 * shared devices, e.g. the family TV
 * cross-zone messaging and authentication
 * discovery and service adapters
 * setting up a personal zone
 * leaving a personal zone
 * joining a personal zone (new device)
 * lost/stolen device interaction (potentially the loss of only device)
 * revocation of device from a personal zone

### Personal Zone Security Processes

#### Authenticating the user to the zone

The exact mechanisms will depend on the device. For a notebook computer this will involve typing a user name and password. For a mobile device it might involve typing a personal identification number. For some situations, the zone may be asked for a stronger authentication of the user. This could involve the presentation of an additional device, e.g. a smart card, or the use of biometric data such as swiping a finger print, or speaking a digit sequence into a microphone. Strong authentication is needed when the user or application is seeking access to critical data or services, e.g. when making a bank transfer. This will take place when needed, and not when the user first authenticates to the zone.

If you are away from home and aren’t carrying any of your normal devices, it should be possible to access your personal zone from a Web browser. Ideally, you would have some kind of dumb device such as a smart card or USB stick to act as a second factor in the login process. Failing that you will have to fall back to entering a strong user id and password issued to you by the zone’s hosting service.

#### Authenticating a device to the zone

Each device will need a means to authenticate itself to the zone. This could be accomplished through a shared secret, or more robustly through public key cryptography. Each device needs to have been registered with the zone before it can be authenticated. The registration process involves the user in order to establish the trust model.

#### Authenticating the zone to an application

Webinos avoids the need for users to enter an id and password into web page forms. Instead the zone is able to authenticate the user on his or her behalf. This relies on machine interpretable information provided by the application (whether hosted or locally installed). The user may be asked to select between alternative persona that he or she has previously set up. This takes place via a UI that is provided by the browser and clearly distinguishable from the web page.

Authentication can use conventional user ID and passwords, but these will be created by webinos and never typed by the user. This avoids the user in having to remember the credentials, and enables the use of strong passwords that are resistant to dictionary attacks. Better yet is to use stronger credentials and mutual authentication. This involves a preliminary exchange of secrets, but avoids the need to send credentials over the wire. Webinos further provides for the use of anonymous credentials based upon zero knowledge proofs. This combines strong identity (e.g. government issued identity cards) with a means to prove to an application certain properties over that identity, but without disclosing further information.

#### Synchronizing context across the zone

The context covers:

* which devices are online as part of the zone
 * personal data that needs to accessible across the zone
 * security information needed for the zone to function

This presumes a means to support secure storage on each device together with information on how to communicate with each device. The synchronization mechanism is based upon 3 way merge algorithms ([[Deliverable_References#Lindholm2001|Lindholm2001]], [[Deliverable_References#GuiffySureMerge|GuiffySureMerge]]) for synchronizing updates to tree structured data. This involves a means to communicate mutations to such data, along with the time the changes took place. Further mechanisms are used to synchronize device clocks, and to ask the user for help when an unresolvable clash is detected. Devices may not be able to communicate directly with each other, in which case other devices can act as relays that bridge differences in interconnect technologies. Synchronization takes place when a device authenticates with the zone, and when there are changes to the context.

#### Sharing devices, e.g. the family TV

Some devices are shared by several people. Such devices can take part in a personal zone, but are marked as being shared. When running an application that involves access to private information, the user may be asked to authenticate himself or herself, e.g. by typing a personal identification number into the remote control for a networked TV.

#### Cross-zone messaging and authentication

Personal Zones form part of a federated social Web. You can determine what devices or services are visible (i.e. discoverable) by others, and what access control rules apply. This can be done on an individual basis, or in terms of the "face" you present to a group of contacts, e.g. your immediate friends, your work colleagues, and the general public. Cross zone messaging can be relayed through the zone hubs, or through peer to peer connections set up with the help of the zone hubs. This architecture permits the optimal use of network resources (e.g. by tunneling events through a single connection to avoid the costs of establishing multiple connections) and maximizing battery life (e.g. through the use of wakeup messages to emulate long lasting connections).

#### Discovery and Service Adapters

Local discovery protocols provide open access to information about supported services, but typically there is a means to inhibit discovery, e.g. via a web page form provided by the device. In many cases, the basic discovery report provides a pointer to further information that can be retrieved via HTTP. This can require authentication, and in principle could involve the use of transpost layer security via HTTPS. Authentication will be involved when it comes to browsing the context in more detail, especially for remote discovery when browsing someone else’s zone.

Having selected a service, it may be necessary to load a service adapter, e.g. for a device connected via USB, it is typically necessary to find a driver based on the product and vendor IDs. The adapter may involve a binary shared object library and a matching JavaScript library. This introduces security concerns, and webinos may need to validate the digital signature for the adapter to verify that it comes from a trusted source, before asking the user to authorize the installation of the adapter.

#### Setting up a personal zone

There are several ways in which a personal zone may be instantiated for the first time. A personal zone begins with a personal zone hub. This might commonly be administered and hosted by a trusted party, such as an internet service provider or network operator. We anticipate that they will offer a cloud-based personal zone hub which is created for you when you register with them. The personal zone hub will offer a small web-based user interface for administration, analogous to those provided by home routers.

#### Security relevant data on the personal zone hub

The personal zone hub contains the following security-relevant data:

-   user profile information for discovery (e.g. public email address, telephone number);
-   hub private key & certificate;
-   list of registered devices, complete with details on:
    -   when they last connected;
    -   how they can be contacted;
    -   what their public keys are & copies of they key certificates;
-   synchronised data, including:
    -   list of recognised external devices and keys;
    -   policies;
    -   preferences;
    -   A list of applications installed on zone devices.

This data has security and privacy concerns, and as a result the personal zone hub must protect its storage and authenticate users attempting to view or edit any of this data. To mitigate the situation where an attacker has gained access to the file store used by a web server hosting the personal zone hub, there needs to be a mechanism whereby the server verifies the integrity of the Hub’s software and data, and securely passes the Hub’s master keys to it. If an attacker is able to install software on the server or to modify existing software, the software will be unable to gain access to the master keys needed to access the zone’s data.

#### Registering a new device with your personal zone

When a new device is first configured, or webinos is installed on it for the first time, it needs to be registered with your personal zone. If you have a device that is already registered, it may be possible to peer that device with the new one, e.g. using some form of local device to device communication such as near field communication (NFC), Bluetooth, or WiFi, or even with a USB stick. The peering process involves a human level protocol step, such as entering a one time PIN, or verifying that such a PIN has been passed between the two devices. If this is the first device you are adding to your Personal Zone, or if the two devices have no means to communicate locally, then a fall back is to register the device directly with the Personal Zone Hub via a web browser using the credentials issued to you by the Zone’s hosting service.

Finally, the most user-friendly way of creating a paired device and personal zone hub is to ship the device to the user pre-registered with the Personal Zone Hub. This can be done in a number of ways. If the user has no Personal Zone Hub originally, the device retailer might create a new one and pair the devices before the user purchases them. Alternatively, they might pre-enter the user’s existing personal zone hub address into the device to allow users to only perform one initial authentication.

#### Authenticating a user to the personal zone hub

Webinos aims to avoid complex authentication overheads and reliance on passwords. As a result, user authentication happens using device capabilities where possible (see the [[Deliverable_Specifications_Authentication_Identity|user authentication section]] for more details). However, when the first device is joined to the personal zone, there are no device capabilities to take advantage of.

For the initial authentication, therefore, a user name and password will be necessary. We do not prescribe a particular technique, but suggest that this capability should be used extremely rarely. Mitigations to consider include:

-   Not supporting much functionality via the web interface unless logged-in using a registered device
-   Not allowing enrolment (except of the initial device) except through a registered device and on-device authentication
-   Notification to all devices whenever security-sensitive decisions are taken via the web interface (this could be through an out-of-bound channel such as a text messages)

The providers of the personal zone hub may also require further authentication when enrolling devices on making changes.

#### Recovering from loss of credentials

The user is expected to remember the credentials used to authenticate himself/herself with the Personal Zone. This may vary from device to device. It should be possible for the user to update these credentials in the situation where the user has forgotten them. If the user is able to authenticate to the Zone with another device, a trusted application can be used to update the user credentials for the device in question. If no device is able through which the user can authenticate with the Zone, then a fall back mechanism should be provided with the Personal Zone Hub, for example, falling back to a strong user id and password provided by the Zone’s hosting service, e.g. as provided when setting up a Personal Zone.

The Personal Zone is responsible for keeping the credentials for access to applications. The user only risks loosing these credentials if all of her devices are lost or destroyed. If any of the user’s devices fall into the wrong hands, the user’s personal data is protected and the device won’t be able to access her Personal Zone without that user’s credentials. In principle, a mechanism could be used to delete personal data after a specified number of failed attempts to authenticate a user with the device. Bona fide users would be protected from data loss through previous synchronization with the Zone Hub. Users can revoke the ability of the device to access the Zone via the Personal Zone Hub. The revocation is spread across all of the devices in the Zone via the normal synchronization mechanisms.

#### Unregistering a device from a personal zone

This is analogous to revoking the device’s rights to access the Zone with the difference that if a device to be unregistered is already authenticated to the Zone, it can be instructed to delete all personal data as part of the revocation process. The process would include:

* The device is contacted by the hub which sends a "delete" event (these events can only be sent by the personal zone hub) to it
 * The device responds by deleting all data stored by webinos, including the device keys, certificates, user credentials, application data and settings. This may be implemented by deleting a cryptographic key if secure storage is in use.
 * The device replies with a "complete" event to the personal zone proxy
 * If the device cannot be contacted, it will synchronise with the personal zone hub and receive the instruction at a later date.
 * The personal zone hub invalidates any certificates referring to the device and adds them to its revocation list
 * All other devices in the personal zone will be synchronised with the revocation list and list of user devices when they next communicate with the personal zone hub.

#### Securely deleting or clearing a personal zone

It should be possible to delete all the data held by the personal zone hub. The following options should be made available:

1.  Delete all the data held on the personal zone hub, except personal zone device identities, certificates and keys
2.  Delete all data stored by all devices within the personal zone, except personal zone device identities, certificates and keys
3.  Delete all personal zone-stored data on all devices including device identities, certificates and keys
4.  Delete all data held by all applications on all devices including device identities, certificates and keys

These options should refer to _secure deletion_ which includes removing any back-ups and overwriting the data storage medium if necessary.

#### Migrating a personal zone hub

This would occur when changing the hosting service for the Hub. A mechanism is needed to copy the Hub’s data to the new location, and to update all of the devices with the new location, and finally to delete all personal data at the old location. This process is likely to involve changing the master keys (see loss of credentials).

The personal zone hub must be able to archive itself into a compressed single file (or virtual machine) with optional password protection so that it can be downloaded and re-instantiated elsewhere.

### Future directions

Phase 2 of the project will further investigate the user interfaces, process and mechanisms used to manage personal zone devices. Mechanisms for in-zone security will also be considered, as discussed in the [[Deliverable_Specifications_Platform_Integrity|platform integrity]] section.
