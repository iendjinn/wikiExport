MINUTES

Hans: notification by email that he is ok with merging the two areas

Karl: he is willing to go with the majority decision, decide on the extent of volantis contribution as soon as some internal issues about webinos project handover are resolved

Heiko: we need to break down the area into specific sub-tasks to have a concrete view on what we work on and what we deliver

Action Point: NTUA (george) and IBBT (Heiko) will start on that immediately and circulate and update so tha all partner can refine the tasks (add more tasks, refine stipulations, reduce descirptions etc) and volunteer to contribute

Action Point: All partners finalize state of the art analysis (EU projects, standards, technologies) this week collectivelly for the entire area in the relevant section already in the wiki

Karl: we need to set up a time-plan (probably a new section on the wiki page) on what we are wokring on/delivering the next week(s)

Dave: W3C will act a liaison between the overlay network area and the work done in context/content adaptation within other projects (SERENOA and PrimeLife)

Dave: we need to come up with a crisp view on our context awareness contribution/architecture in webinos encompassing ideas from the work done in federated social web (maybe a white paper from this area can find his way to the W3C workshop of federated social web in Berlin in june)

Dave: we also need to plan our work having in mind to produce early demos of what we deliver. Context management scope too broad, need to define subtopics to focus on.

Action Point: Create new section â€œarea breakdownâ€ where we define specific areas on which to work.
