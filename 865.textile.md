20110605-10 webinos meeting in Sophia Antipolis
===============================================

Authentication (WP3 (3.1, 3.2, 3.5))
------------------------------------

Authentication within webinos has been further discussed in a WP3 session. The results are directly added to the [[Spec_-_Authentication|deliverable]] and they are summarised in the minutes below.

Whiteboard contents from the discussion on 8 June: "photograph":http://dev.webinos.org/redmine/attachments/639/Authentication_API_Brainstorming_Sophia-Antipolis.jpg

The "presentation":/redmine/attachments/634/32-Sophia-Security-APIs.pptx John compiled after the discussion.

Minutes:

-   Authentication
    -   First user to device
    -   Then device to zone/other zone
-   User auth
    -   Method chosen by device
    -   Needs to fulfil minimum requirement defined by webinos
    -   Reveals access to protected storage which contains priv key of the device
-   Dev auth
    -   Dev sets up TLS channel to PZH, including mutual auth
    -   Dev sets up TLS channel to other device from which a service is to be accessed
    -   On connection to PZH, at very first, the data cache is synchronised
-   Apps use the established channels for any further auth
-   certificates
    -   PZH acts as a CA and can issue certificates for new devices
    -   All devices which have a certificate from this particular PZH are considered to belong to the zone; what they can do in the zone is defined by the AC policy
-   P2P communication is set-up by the use of the PZH (s) in the beginning but it is continued on a separate direct connection after auth
-   Making two PZH known to another: Exchange the zoneâ€™s certificate between the PZHs
    -   Local proximity: a separate channel (e.g. PIN exchange on BT pairing) makes sure that the right devices are communicating and then the certificates are exchanged and stored in the PZHs
    -   In the online case: a separate channel (e.g. phone, social proximity, â€¦) is used to confirm binding of user to the zoneâ€™s certificate
-   Comments/issues to be kept in mind for later
    -   Authentication level depends on request: if an app first sends its request and auth is performed thereafter, level of auth can be chosen according to the sensitivity of the access. In phase one, we authenticate first and always set-up the TLS channel
    -   The weakest user authentication among all the devices of the user define the strength of user authentication in the entire personal zone
    -   PZH is a sensitive component which is a valuable asset with a high confidentiality and integrity level
        -   If its user data is accessed in an unauthorised way, an attacker may be able to issue new certificates and by that add devices to the zone
    -   Phase 2: certificate revocation and expiry
    -   User and device registration still to be defined
    -   we currently have only one level of user authentication. If we wish to have different ones depending on the sensitivity of data/resources, we need to extend the architecture
    -   User authentication is currently only discussed for devices which the user actively uses (e.g. a mobile). However, there are others which permanently run services without users being authenticated/logged-in. In the latter case, the PZP needs access to the private key even without user authentication just from the point in time where the device was added to the zone.
