Implementation objectives from a technical perspective

â€¢ microPZP applies to a device with 2Mb memory, no display and where full PZP is not possible .
â€¢ microPZP always has a co-responding PZP which manages functions on itâ€™s behalf
â€¢ microPZP should have access to a network connection
â€¢ Enrolment microPZP should be via the co-responding PZP.
â€¢ Certificate management - microPZPs can handle certificates.
â€¢ MicroPZP APIs - it have to device specific and are restricted to no more than two APOs. The APOs should be specific purpose PZP and not general purpose PZP.
â€¢ microPZP administration â€“This should be same as standard PZP
â€¢ Connection manager functionality â€“microPZP should find other PZP and connect. So microPZP should have its private key prior to connect to peer PZP.
â€¢ Discoverability (must be discoverable) - It should be able to find other PZPs.
â€¢ Secure communication is managed by TLS

The following represent implementation guidelines and suggestions for microPZP.
Since microPZP allows native implementations, the technologies suggested here are indicative
* nodejs is good but is quite heavy weight. The v8 engine or TinyJS is recommended
* Connectivity could be Bluetooth/ZigBee/Serial.
* polarssl and matrixssl for secure connections via TLS.
* COAP and MQTT will be universal protocols for the internet of things, COAP might be more used for configuration or actuation control while MQTT is often used in sending real time events.
