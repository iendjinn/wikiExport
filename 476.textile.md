Context driven adaptation

### Requirements Addressed in this Work Area

|**Priority**|**Requirement&nbsp;ID**|**Description**|**Comment**|
|High|NC-DEV-IBBT-005|The Webinos platform SHOULD support device independent authoring of applications.|To make sure that I understand this correctly: does it mean that the application language format should be device-agnostic? (e.g. no iPhone hacks)|
|High|NC-DEV-IBBT-003|The Webinos platform SHOULD provide standard UI widgets.|
|High|NC-DWP-IBBT-004|The Webinos runtime SHOULD provide a service that composes an optimized interface layout based on the application’s UI widgets and definition.|Supplementary to NC-DEV-IBBT-003 (provide not only widgets, but also layouts).|
|High|CAP-DEV-ambiesense-053|An application SHALL be able to provide user interface components with the native look and feel standard for the device, and also with the W3C look and feel inherited from the HTML web standards.|Supplementary to NC-DEV-IBBT-003 (description of how the widgets should look like).|
|Mid|NC-DEV-IBBT-002|The Webinos platform MUST support the integration of external content adaptation services into the platform.||
|Mid|NC-DWP-IBBT-006|The Webinos platform SHOULD provide services that can transform file formats.|Supplementary to NC-DWP-IBBT-002. I understand that Webinos platform should provide content adaptation services by itself, but also allow for integrating external services (as an alternative).|
|N/A|DA-DEV-ambiesense-045|It MUST be possible for an application developer to use device and user context as means to adapt the delivery and presentation of content.|This requirement is really vague, I don’t know how to verify it. Does it simplay means that the developer should have access to specific data regarding device and user context?
On the other hand, it’s the only requirement which mentions something about adaptation according to the current context.|
|N/A|NC-DEV-IBBT-001|The Webinos platform MUST allow applications to access data describing the user, device and application.|I’m not sure if adressing this requirement should be part of this work area (probably should be addressed by the API team).|
|N/A|NC-DEV-IBBT-007|An application SHOULD be able to check device compatibility with certain file formats.|Comment similar to NC-DEV-IBBT-001. I’m not sure if this requirement should be addressed in this work area. Maybe an API should be created to allow the application to retrieve this information from the webinos runtime.|

### Introduction

The figure below (from http://www.w3.org/2001/di/IntroToDI.html) shows a client accessing a web application. The client and application server can interact directly, or through one or more proxies. A context-driven adaptation process can be introduced anywhere in this path:

-   Server: e.g. device independent authoring, semantic enhancement
-   Intermediary: e.g. content transcoding services (Opera Mini, Navorra, etc.)
-   Client: e.g. progressive enhancement, javascript feature/preference detection

**Serenoa**

http://serenoa.morfeo-project.org/

An FP7 EU project whose objective is to create a platform that would enable the creation of context-sensitive service front-ends.

Automatic adaptation will be done in two major ways:
* users can intervene in the adaptation (e.g. by controlling, suggesting, accepting/rejecting adaptations, requesting better adaptations)
* the system can learn from users (e.g., by observation, by sensing, by machine learning)

The project is still in the pre-requirements phase.

An FP7 EU project which aims to develop an environment, which provides people with the ability to continue to perform their tasks when they move about and change their interaction device.

This project focuses on the following aspects:
* device change
* state persistence
* content adaptation

**IDEAL2**

http://mymobileweb.morfeo-project.org/mymobileweb/mymw-tech/ideal2

A specification of a modular and extensible language for the description of device-independent user interfaces.

The IDEAL2 language is similar to XHTML, but claimed to be more powerful and higher level, allowing for describing user interfaces in an abstract manner, i.e. without commitment on how such a UI will be finally rendered.

### Standards

### Existing technologies

#### Android fragments API

The fragments library introduces a mechanism that makes it easier for applications to scale across a variety of screen sizes. It allows developers to break up their applications into subcomponents called "fragments". Fragments allow developers to write modular applications with an adaptable layout the can run properly on both larger screen as well as smaller screen devices.
(cf. Figure below from http://developer.android.com/guide/topics/fundamentals/fragments.html).

#### Volantis Mobile Content Framework

The framework consists of several components:

-   Multi-Channel Server (MCS). The main component responsible for adapting the page to different devices.
-   Media Access Proxy (MAP). The component responsible for converting the media files (images, audio, video).
-   Device Repository Web Service (DRWS). The device database which holds information about devices and their attributes (+8000 devices and +850 attributes).

MCS receives the page description, retrieves the device capabilities using DRWS, and produces the page version optimized for the current device. Media files can be converted using the MAP service.

The page description consists of the following parts:

-   Page definition. The page definition is created using the XDIME 2 (xHTML Device Independent Markup Extension), a format which is similar to XHTML 2.
-   Page styles. The page styles are defined in the format similar to CSS 2, which is extended in order to allow support for custom layouts and images.
-   Page layouts. The page layouts are defined in the XML file. They can be defined either for all the page, or only for specific elements of the page.
-   Image definitions. As alternative to converting the images using MAP, it’s possible to provide several image variants and to define rules for selecting the optimal image variant.

Page styles, page layouts and image definitions contain sections which may be defined to be applied only to specific types of devices. The rules for applying the specific sections are defined using device attributes. Therefore it is possible to define, for example, that a 3 column layout is to be applied to all the devices which have the screen width bigger than 600 pixels, while all other devices should use single column layout. Or that a specific style should be applied to handheld devices running Symbian S60. Or that gray-scale, low-resolution logo should be selected when displaying the page on WAP devices.
