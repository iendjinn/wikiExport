Device Credential Management in Personal Zones
==============================================

{{toc}}

This section describes how credentials on personal zones are used to identify devices. This also covers revocation, and details about credentials used in enrolment.

  PZH CA private key               private key   4096 bits+    PZH                   The personal zone hub CA key, used for issuing new certificates and revoking devices from the zone
  PZH CA public key certificate    X509 cert                   PZH, PZPs, External   Personal Zone CA root certificate, part of the chain of certificates identifying every personal zone device. An identity of sorts for the user.
  PZH TLS private key              private key   2048 bits+    PZH                   The PZH TLS server/client key, used for making connections to personal zone proxies and external hubs

  PZH web private key              private key   2048 bits+    PZH / Farm            The key used by the PZH to serve the web-based hub interface.
  PZP TLS private key              private key   2048 bits+    PZP                   The PZP’s trusted identity key, used for TLS sessions with the PZP, both peer-to-peer and between PZP and PZH.
  PZP TLS public key certificate   X509 cert                   PZPs, PZH             The PZP’s identity key certificate issued by the PZH CA.

Threats and attacks
-------------------

Todo: update misuse cases in this area.

Device credentials are used to mitigate a number of threats to the webinos architecture, as well as creating new potential attacks. The following attack trees define some of issues:

### Unauthorised access to APIs

This attack tree is rooted by the idea of an attacker somehow connecting an unauthorised device to the personal zone, and then using this connection to access

"Attack Tree":http://dev.webinos.org/redmine/attachments/download/2059

### Privacy concerns

The use of a single key hierarchy is a privacy concern, as it means that a user can be uniquely identified by different users at different times.

This phase of the webinos security and privacy framework does not tackle this concern.

However, there is a potential solution:

-   Each PZH can create multiple key hierarchies
-   Each key hierarchy can be associated with a different hub URL and OpenID

Then, any user can give a different hub URL or OpenID to a service provider to (potentially) avoid linkability issues. More work is needed here to check this solution.

Revocation
----------

Within a personal zone, revocation is implemented through a synchronised certificate revocation list (CRL) issued by the personal zone hub. This allows the user to selectively revoke a device by visiting the hub’s web interface and clicking a `revoke’ button next to the chosen device. The CRL is synchronised between devices whenever they connect to the hub. The choice of CRLs rather than the Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP) was motivated by a desire for simplicity, as well as the fact that hubs already implement synchronization for policy enforcement.

<div class="uml">
actor Alice
participant Browser
participant BadDevice
participant PZHWebServer
participant PZH
participant OtherPZPs
activate Browser
activate PZH

 Login process 

Alice -> Browser : Visit PZH Login URL
Alice -> Browser : "... OpenID process .."

 Revocation 
Alice -> Browser : Click "Revoke Certificate"
Browser -> PZHWebServer: Fetch list of devices
PZHWebServer -> PZH : Find PZP’s connected
PZH -> PZHWebServer: List of personal zone devices
PZHWebServer -> Browser : Display list of personal zone devices
Alice -> Browser : Click on the "BadDevice" entry and click "Revoke".
Browser -> PZHWebServer: Call revokeDevice( "BadDevice" )
PZHWebServer -> PZH : Device to revoke
PZH -> PZH : Policy check (NOT IMPLEMENTED)
PZH -> PZH : Find BadDevice’s certificate
PZH -> PZH : Update CRL to include BadDevice’s certificate serial number
PZH -> PZH : Save CRL to synchronised storage area
PZH -> PZH : Disconnect BadDevice if currently connected
PZH -> PZH : Restart TLS stack
PZH -> PZHWebServer: Status update
PZHWebServer -> Browser : Show "done"

deactivate Browser

 Synchronisation 

activate OtherPZPs
OtherPZPs -> PZH : Connect to PZH
OtherPZPs -> PZH : Synchronisation initiated
PZH -> OtherPZPs : Send Updated CRL
OtherPZPs -> OtherPZPs : Store CRL, restart any TLS connections
deactivate OtherPZPs

 BadDevice attempts to connect to PZH 

activate BadDevice
BadDevice -> PZH : TLS connection request
PZH -> BadDevice : Refused - certificate revoked

</div>
Devices which remain offline for significant periods run the risk of having an out-of-date CRL. A stolen device or compromised key could successfully connect in a peer-to-peer manner with this device. There are several ways to mitigate this threat although a perfect solution is impossible, as offline, peer-to-peer communication between devices is a requirement of webinos. However, a method analogous to OCSP stapling could be used. Each device could be required to present an up-to-date CRL for the zone with every new connection. These CRLs could be issued by the hub on a well-known schedule, such as daily or weekly. This would limit the window for a malicious device. An alternative would be to require any device which has not connected to the hub for a certain time period to reconnect briefly when a peer-to-peer connection is made. Neither of these solutions is likely to be user-friendly, and we therefore do not address this threat at present. For most people who do not face targetted attacks, and have devices stolen purely for monetary value rather than as part of a bigger attack, this seems a reasonable trade-off.

Finally, revocation of a personal zone hub must be possible in situations where the user wants to move their hub to another service provider, or delete it.

_Habib: We can use CRL in peer to peer connection. So if CRL is updated in one of the peers cannot be established_

Backup and recovery
-------------------

Fortunately, the webinos personal zone system (with a defined import/export proceedure for hubs and OpenID as user identity) does not require an explicit recovery system for credentials. The OpenID provider will manage loss of password or user credentials. For the PKI, in the instance that a key is compromised or lost, the device can be revoked and then re-added. This requires UI modification and no new underlying functionality. With this in mind, all access control policies and references to devices in webinos should be to a _friendly name_ rather than public key identity or certificate serial number. This means that any key can be mapped onto a particular device name, making the re-issue of keys for a device straightforward. An advantage of this approach is that keys do not need to be backed-up onto another device, reducing maintenance overhead.

Protection of credentials
-------------------------

All the device credentials discussed in this section may need a level of protection. The following table illustrates requirements, recommendations and implemented solutions.

_Habib: Might good idea to write about gnome-keying and foundations for mac. I can add some stuff for Android and get details for Windows stuff too_
