Adaptive Software Engineering
=============================

{{>toc}}

The development and deployment of ubiquitous applications introduces an important series of resource-consuming requirements [Banavar and Bernstein 2004]. The available combinations of hardware characteristics, operating systems, software frameworks, etc. are virtually endless. For software developers, this diversity has turned out to be a double-barreled asset. It provides consumers the freedom to operate applications at will across several devices. On the other hand, the device diversity asset heavily fragments the application’s delivery targets. By the absence of a general native development solution, developers often have no alternative than to create and maintain a set of device-dependent versions of their applications. Hence, ensuring a viable balance between development costs and an application’s market coverage will more than ever become a challenging issue.

Separation of Concerns
----------------------

To accommodate with the high-variability aspect, software systems are traditionally engineered along three orthogonal dimensions: the development phases, the system’s views, and its aspects [Schauerhuber et al. 2007]. This approach is characterized by the separation of concerns, as it embodies a well accepted technique to reduce the engineering complexity of a software system [Dijkstra 1976]. First of all, the phase dimension sets out the different stages of the Web development process, ranging from analysis, to design, and implementation. Each of these phases requires a number of specific views addressing the system’s content structures, the navigational structures between content nodes, and its presentation towards the user. Hence, the views dimension. Finally, the aspects dimension sets out the structural and behavioral aspects of each of the above-mentioned views.

The growing presence and importance of mobile and ubiquitous applications emphasizes the need for fragmentation management within the Web engineering methodology. As identified by [Koch et al. 2008], context-aware adaptability can be considered as an additional Web engineering dimension, crosscutting all existing Web modeling dimensions. [Schauerhuber et al. 2007] as well as [Linaje et al. 2010] investigated the support for adaptability requirements within various Web engineering methods. A number of approaches were identified to incorporate partial Model Driven Architecture (MDA) compliance (e.g., UWE, WSDM, HERA, WebML, etc.). Through an MDA-based approach, software development is started with an abstract platform-independent model (PIM) specification of the system [Miller and Mukerji 2003]. A transformation model is in turn applied to compile the PIM to a platform-specific model (PSM). The transformation process is at the heart of MDA’s adaptability approach. For this purpose, MDA proposes the Query-View-Transformation standard (QVT) as a language for specifying model-to-model transformation rules [OMG 2011].

Furthermore, recent research on model driven engineering has been particularly active in the domain of user interface engineering. The CAMELEON Reference Framework (CRF) defines an important foundation for this type of approaches [Calvary et al. 2003]. The framework specifies a context-sensitive user interface development process, driven by an intrinsic notion of the current user context, the environment context, as well as the platform context. According to the CRF approach, an application’s user interface development consists of multiple levels of abstraction. Starting from an abstract representation of the interface’s task and domain model, a PSM of the user interface is subsequently generated by means of a chained model transformations based on contextual knowledge. A number of languages have adopted CRF: UsiXML [Limbourg et al. 2004], useML [Meixner and Thiels 2008], and MARIA [Paterno et al. 2009]. Moreover, the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) charted the Model-Based UI Working Group (MBUI-WG) as part of its Ubiquitous Web Activity (UWA) to investigate the standardization of context-aware user interface authoring [Cantera 2010]. To do so, the working group aims to use HTML5 as the key delivery platform for generated user interfaces.

Nevertheless the potential flexibility of model driven approaches, the applicability of existing Web modeling methods for handling ubiquitous fragmentation remains rather limited. This observation can be explained through the complex composition of the design space. The aforementioned contextual aspects, both static and dynamic, influence a modeling method’s strength and expressiveness in terms of adaptability [Kappel et al. 2001]. In result, adaptability requirements ought to be handled throughout every stage of a system’s development life cycle. Especially from a ubiquitous software development perspective, the multi-dimensional impact of adaptability puts a heavy burden on the software engineering and development processes.

Modeling Ubiquitous Context-awareness
-------------------------------------

The availability of detailed and reliable metadata regarding a user’s contextual situation provides an important driver for enabling rich ubiquitous applications. The exact entities represented by this contextual information can be of a very dynamic nature, potentially affecting the consumer’s expectations towards the application’s user interface, behavior, content, etc. In initial context-aware research, context of use was considered a component containing only two parameters: the end-user’s location and the set of objects in the immediate vicinity [Schilit et al. 1994]. The subsequent introduction of extensible contextual categories has drastically increased the flexibility of this definition [Brown et al. 1997]. Chen and Kotz hereto identified five contextual base categories: the device context, the user context, the environment context, the time context, and the historical context [Chen and Kotz 2000].

The device context describes the characteristics of the target device that is being used to access the application. A ubiquitous ecosystem covers a diversity of screen sizes, interaction methods, software support, etc. In Web-based environments, the device capabilities are generally retrieved through Resource Description Framework (RDF) devices profiles, i.e., User Agent Profile (UAProf) [OMA 2001] and Composite Capability/Preference Profiles (CC/PP) [Kiss2010]. The necessary device identification step in this process is handled through HTTP header user agent matching. In order to facilitate the collection and aggregation of these device profiles, the W3C Mobile Web Initiative (MWI) standardized the Device Description Repository specification (DDR). The specification provides an API and its associated vocabulary for structured access to context providers services [Rabin et al. 2008]. In essence, a DDR thus provides a standardized means for retrieving contextual information about a-priori knowledge on the characteristics of a particular target device or Web runtime. Various open as well as proprietary DDR implementations are actively being maintained. Most notably OpenDDR, WURFL, and DeviceAtlas.

In a ubiquitous setting, the end-user’s profile description gains more and more importance. Besides exposing information on user preferences and specific experience, this model should also comprise knowledge regarding the user’s specific abilities and disabilities. E.g., enabling accessibility requirements for providing support to elderly people, and people with disabilities. From this perspective, Heckmann proposed the GUMO formalism as a general user model ontology for representing generic user descriptions using the Web Ontology Language semantics (OWL) [Heckmann 2005]. The current challenge in this domain is modeling the enormous amount of parameters and relationships that characterize the user context [Silva et al. 2011]. To overcome this issue, forces are being joined with other ontology-driven projects such as Linked Data [Heath and Bizer 2011], and UbisWorld [Heckmann et al. 2009].

The environment-, time-, and historical context aspects define where, how, and when the interaction between the user and an application is exactly taking place. The environment context is specified by observing the numerous sensors available on the user’s device (e.g., location, temperatures, network service discovery, the level of background noise, etc.). Furthermore, the notion of time and historical context is not to be neglected. As context is a dynamic concept, support for temporal patterns recognition and management is needed. The W3C Ubiquitous Web Domain is currently in the process of standardizing the Delivery Context Ontology specification (DCO) [Cantera and Rhys 2010}. The DCO provides a formal model of the characteristics of the environment in which devices, applications, and services are operating.
