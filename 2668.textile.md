Policy Structure
================

As decided in the "call on 3rd April 2013":https://docs.google.com/document/d/1b3V3QRsNfZDtceppFWpjZIb8yYixgwqgCjWNkyGfpho/edit?usp=sharing, webinos policies will have the following structure.

Root policy file
----------------

The root policy file will never be edited and is used just to pull in the other policies.

It uses two combining rules: the "Deny-unless-permit" rule requires the PDP to reply with a ‘deny’ result if there are any ‘not applicable’ results returned from the inner policy. The "Deny-overrides" combining rule means that any one policy saying "deny" will override the others. This means that manufacturer policies will override users, which is an important requirement.

Note that the "Deny-unless-permit" policy needs to be changed to accommodate Prompt effects as well as Allow, Deny and Not Applicable. Because no existing combining rule exists, we suggest defining our own, called "Deny-if-not-applicable" or "Deny-unless-permit-or-prompt".

policy.xml:
<pre><code class="xml">
<![](DOCTYPE doc [
    <)ENTITY manufacturer SYSTEM "manufacturer.xacml">
 <![](ENTITY user SYSTEM "user.xacml">
    <)ENTITY app SYSTEM "app.xacml">
]>
<policy-set combining-algorithm="Deny-unless-permit-or-prompt">
 <policy-set combining-algorithm="Deny-overrides">
 &manufacturer;
 &user;
 &app;
 </policy-set>
</policy-set>
</code></pre>

As discussed in Turin meeting (June 20th 2013) an alternative proposal for root policy is the following:

<pre><code class="xml">
<![](DOCTYPE doc [
    <)ENTITY manufacturer SYSTEM "manufacturer.xacml">
 <![](ENTITY user SYSTEM "user.xacml">
    <)ENTITY app SYSTEM "app.xacml">
]>
<policy-set combining-algorithm="Deny-unless-permit-or-prompt">
 &manufacturer;
 <policy-set combining-algorithm="First-maching-target">
 &app;
 &user;
 </policy-set>
</policy-set>
</code></pre>

This way the manufacturer will be combined (using deny-overrides) with application policy or with user policy (in case application policy does not exists or returns inapplicable or undetermined).

The "deny-unless-permit-or-prompt" combining algorithm should behave in a similar way to the "deny-overrides" combining algorithm defined in http://www.webinos.org/content/html/D033/Policy.htm. The exception being that the "deny-unless-permit-or-prompt" algorithm returns deny if the result is undetermined. This differers from the XACML 3.0 "deny-unless-permit" definition in that we weight towards _deny_ where as the "deny-unless-permit" is weighted towards _permit_.

If we adopt this approach, the definition of "deny-unless-permit-or-prompt" becomes:
* If any child evaluates to "deny", then the overall result is "deny".
* Otherwise, if any child is "undetermined", then the overall result is "deny".
* Otherwise, if any child evaluates to "prompt-oneshot", then the overall result is "prompt-oneshot".
* Otherwise, if any child evaluates to "prompt-session", then the overall result is "prompt-session".
* Otherwise, if any child evaluates to "prompt-blanket", then the overall result is "prompt-blanket".
* Otherwise, if any child evaluates to "permit", then the overall result is "permit".
* Otherwise, the overall result is "deny".

An alternate definition which weights towards "permit" would be:
* if any child evaluates to "permit", then the overall result is "permit".
* Otherwise, if any child evaluates to "prompt-blanket", then the overall result is "prompt-blanket".
* Otherwise, if any child evaluates to "prompt-session", then the overall result is "prompt-session".
* Otherwise, if any child evaluates to "prompt-oneshot", then the overall result is "prompt-oneshot".
* Otherwise, the overall result is "deny".

The first definition should be adopted as the algorithm as this definition supports the goal that the manufactures policy should be able to override the users policy to restrict access. If the first definition is used we have the following comparison between "deny-unless-permit-or-prompt" and "deny-overrides":

Algorithm results (AL = allow, DE = deny, PR = prompt, UN = undetermined, IN = inapplicable)

Manufacturer policies
---------------------

We did not decide on the exact structure of manufacturer policies. They must be write-protected on the platform. They must also have a root policy set.

User policies
-------------

These are edited by the policy editor application and may be split further into other sets.

We did not decide on the exact structure of user policies or combining rules. These are likely to contain rules about users, devices and services, such as "Alice can access Bob’s geolocation service".

Application policies
--------------------

These are generated at install time and consolidated into one policy set. These define the least-privilege restrictions on an application, such that applications can only access resources they ask for.

We did not decide on the exact structure of user policies or combining rules. A "first applicable" or "only one applicable" rule may be best.

It could be that this policy file simply references individual policy files for each application, or it could be that this policy file contains policies for each application.
