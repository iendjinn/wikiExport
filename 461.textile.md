Discovery Technologies
======================

Each interconnect technology can have its own discovery mechanisms, and some have several, each with their own terminology. Webinos will need to provide an overlay that abstracts away from the variations and which offers simple naming for end users and web developers. The overlay will need to store the mapping from user friendly names to the underlying data registered for the device and needed to communicate with it.

Interconnect technologies include:

-   3G, WiFi, WiMAX, Bluetooth, ZigBee, NFC, RJ45, USB, IEEE 1394, …

Only some of these support IP directly. Webinos should provide a means for an IP accessible device to proxy for devices that are not IP addressable.

IP based networks
-----------------

For IP based networks, three such mechanisms are:

### Multicast DNS

Invented by Apple for simplifying the connection of devices in home networks. The Apple implementation is called "Bonjour". An open source equivalent is "Avahi". Devices start by randomly picking a link local IP address in the range (169.254.**.**) and making an ARP request to see if this address is already in use.

Devices assign themselves name in the ".local" domain, and will adjust this if they detect other devices with the same name. Users can assign human meaningful names with spaces in them. User agents query for devices with multicast UDP requests. The devices check for a match and respond with a multicast UDP packet with the IP address and port number, the device’s domain name, and a list of protocol and/or service names. The device domain names use human meaningful conventions e.g. "Dave’s laptop._workstation.local". A nice feature is the ability for a device to report on other devices including external services such as the BBC news on the Web, or a hotel’s local Web server giving details of the hotel’s services. Multicast DNS isn’t designed to support tens of thousands of devices, but this can be worked around with discovery hubs.

On Linux, try mdns-scan or avahi-browse -a -v. This only found my Linux workstation on my WiFi network and not the ADSL Modem, nor the Samsung laser printer.

### Simple Service Discovery Protocol (SSDP)

Invented by Microsoft and considerably more complicated than Multicast DNS. SSDP is a UPnP and uses HTTP for notication announcements that give a service type URI and a unique service name.

On linux try gssdp-device-sniffer. On my WiFi network this found the ADSL Modem and the Laser printer, but not the Linux workstations.

#### Service Location Protocol (SLP)

Defined in RFC 2608 and supported by Hewlett-Packard’s network printers, Novell, and Sun Microsystems, but ignored by some other large vendors. SLP works over UDP or TCP. On UDP devices listen on port 427 for
multicast requests. Devices advertise themselves with a URI like

service:printer:lpr://myprinter/myqueue

This may be supplemented by a list of attributes e.g.

<pre>
 (printer-name=Hugo),
 (printer-natural-language-configured=en-us),
 (printer-location=In my home office),
 (printer-document-format-supported=application/postscript),
 (printer-color-supported=false),
 (printer-compression-supported=deflate, gzip)
</pre>

If the data doesn’t fit in a single packet, a flag is given that the user agent can act on to request the SLP info via TCP. SLP also supports discovery agents and presumably this helps with scaling up to larger networks with bridged local networks.

### UPnP and DLNA

On linux try upnp-inspector. On my network this found the ADSL Modem but not my Laser printer.

Other interconnect technologies
-------------------------------

### WiFi

For WiFi it is possible to detect access points and what kind of encryption they are using if any, as well as devices operating in ad hoc mode. It should be possible to detect device MAC addresses.

### USB

For USB see the source code for the Linux lsusb command. This lists the bus and device number, the device ID and a human readable description e.g. Logic3 / SpectraVideo plc A4Tech SWOP-3 Mouse, and Microdia Sonix Integrated Webcam.

### Bluetooth

For Bluetooth, a scan shows the device ID and type, e.g. phone. This id can be used as a proxy identifier for people, i.e. who is present in the room or nearby. There is a small set of known device types, e.g. phone, input device, headset, modem, computer, network, camera, printer or video device. Users can provide a meaningful name for their device e.g. "Me" as seen for a phone in a car that drove past my window!
