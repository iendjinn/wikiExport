Recommendation for extensions in webinos
========================================

What are extensions in webinos?
-------------------------------

Extensions in webinos will provide access to non-webinos APIs / unique device features.
In order to encourage 3rd party developers to build and use extensions a technical solution to develop extensions has to be specified.
From a more generic stand point three distinctive parts have to be specified for extensions:

1.  3rd party developer APIs for accessing extensions inside a webinos application,
2.  pre-defined interfaces for integrating the extension into the webinos runtime (e.g., initialize function of the extension, mapping of extension methods/attributes to Javascript methods/attributes)
3.  a data-scheme for providing meta data about the extension (e.g., name, supported platforms)

Technical solutions: Browser plug-ins vs. JavaScript add-ons
------------------------------------------------------------

From a technical point of view there are two options available to build extensions for webinos: Browser plug-ins or add-ons to the JavaScript engine (a glue between a JavaScript engine and native libraries). The latter can be combined with an embedded web server to allow a remote usage of the extension API.

### Browser plug-ins

The general plug-in concept (NPAPI, PEPPER, ActiveX) for web browsers provides support for 2D/3D output and additional media types inside a web application. Additionally a plug-in provides a scriptable interface to the web application, which makes it possible to extend the â€œfunctionalityâ€ of the java script engine.

### Javascript add-ons

Another technical way to built extensions in webinos is to add new attributes or methods to the javascript-engine. The added attributes/methods are linked to native libraries. This has been done in js-ctypes [1] for Firefox add-ons or for add-ons in Node.js [2].
js-ctypes is an interface to native libraries stored on the hosting device. js-ctypes enables the access to these libraries. It does not provide any methods to store or install extension code. The js-ctypes module in FF is only available to applications running in the chrome and it cannot interact with scripts of a web application.

<pre>
<code class="Javascript">
Components.utils.import("resource://gre/modules/ctypes.jsm");
var lib = ctypes.open("C:WINDOWSsystem32user32.dll");
/* Declare the signature of the function we are going to call */
var msgBox = lib.declare("MessageBoxW", ctypes.winapi_abi, ctypes.int32_t, ctypes.int32_t,ctypes.jschar.ptr, ctypes.jschar.ptr,ctypes.int32_t);
var MB_OK = 3;
var ret = msgBox(0, "Hello world", "title", MB_OK);
lib.close();
</code>
</pre>

Node.js is running as a stand alone javascript engine on the device. Addons are dynamically linked shared objects, which can provide glue to C and C++ libraries. Node statically compiles all its dependencies into the executable.

### Local extension server

Node.js can be coupled with server module in order to make extensions remotely available. The extension can be then accessed using XHR or a web socket connection.

Extension types
---------------

We can distinguish extensions by its user group. There are on the hand platform specific extensions, which are available to all applications executed on the device and on the other hand there are extensions which can be coupled to a specific application.

### Platform specific extensions

The platform specific model is used in the general browser plug-in concept. Once the plugin is installed on the device, the plug-in will be used by all web application, which includes an embedded objected mapped to the specific MIME-Type of the plugin.

### Application specific extension (packaged to the application)

This concept of application specific extensions has been applied in HP webOS Plugin Development Kit (PDK)[3]. A similar approach can be found in Chrome extensions, where an extension can embed a NPAPI plugin .Since the NPAPI binary is platform (OS) specific, a binary for each platform is included inside the application package [4].

Mapping of extension related requirements to technical solutions
----------------------------------------------------------------

||**NPAPI**|**js-ctypes**|**Node.js Add-ons**|
| (CAP-DWB-FHG-002) The webinos runtime SHOULD allow access to non-webinos APIs to device features|designed to add support for additional MIME-types for the rendering engine.

|Extensions SHALL be packaged in a way that is as similar as possible to applications.|NPAPI is one binary file.

|Extensions SHALL be treated in a way that is similar and consistent with standard device features.|partially fullfilled: Plugin is embedded object in HTML and provides a scriptable interface. | |extension API is used in the same way as the regular APIs|
|An Extension that contains platform-specific code MUST be associated with the supported platform(s).|must be specified in the Meta data description of the application| Javascript code is os specific. platform association needs to be integrated |must be specified in the Meta data description of the application|

Considerations for implementation
---------------------------------

subsystemes which need to be implemented:
* System to remotely install extensions on the device.
* System to handle and install plug-ins, which are part of an application package
* policy enforcement for installing extensions on the device and enforcing access to an extension

NPAPI:
* System to enable remote access to the extension

Node.js:
* Middleware on top of Node.js to expose the APIs of the extension
* JavaScript stub to access the extension APIs

Recommendation
--------------

For local usage a solution based on NPAPI is the most compelling one. Itâ€™s widely supported in browser runtimes and supports graphical output on the device. The graphical output could be relevant for games (one of the reasons, why HP/Palm introduced the webOS PDK). A remote access to a NPAPI plug-in could be achieved, but would be limited to its scripting interface.

When it comes to remote usage a Node.js based solution seems the most feasible. But the extension would not be able to render content. Additionally Node.js would require a second JavaScript engine running on the device.
