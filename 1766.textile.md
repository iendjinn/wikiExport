Background - Messaging
======================

Introduction
------------

The webinos architecture features a powerful and extensible messaging framework that allows to easily exchange arbitrary data, in terms of _events_, among addressable _entities_ (e.g., applications, services), also completely hiding away any complexity related to the different underlying interconnect technologies.

It is based on a flexible, yet rigorously defined, event description that is both independent of the actual payload data format and serialization format for data transmission. This basically means that custom event-based protocols can be easily defined and implemented and that it is possible to choose the "encoding" that better suits the involved interconnect technology.

Despite the swiss-army knife-like nature of this system, at a basic level the handling of events reduces to just a few simple concepts from the developer perspective: generating and sending events, or forwarding them, and registering listeners for incoming events. More advanced features are also offered, including, but not limited to, the possibility to send/forward events to multiple destinations at once, to associate event listeners to a particular event source, destination and/or type, to specify a time frame for event delivery, to ask for delivery notifications and to control/monitor the storing and forwarding of events that cannot be immediately delivered.

Furthermore, two more specific protocols are defined on top of this low level generic framework, one regarding event delivery notifications and another describing RPC functionality needed to implement webinos services.

Scope
-----

### What’s in scope

-   Event description: what a generic event looks like from the developer’s point of view, which metadata is compulsorily or optionally associated to each event;
-   Event processing: how generic event metadata influences the sending, caching, storing, forwarding and listening to events;
-   Application-, device- and network-level event routing: how the event handling mechanism interfaces to other parts of the webinos architecture to allow event exchange;
-   Event delivery notifications and RPC protocols: what they are, how they work, what their relationship with the generic event handling mechanism is.

### What’s out of scope

-   Interconnect technology-dependent details of data transmission over the network;
-   Discovery and binding of addressable entities;
-   Definition of special-purpose event-based protocols;
-   User-visible notifications and user interaction.

Review of State of the Art
--------------------------

The "XMPP":http://xmpp.org/ core protocol and some of its extensions (also known as "XEPs":http://xmpp.org/xmpp-protocols/xmpp-extensions/) have been analyzed as today’s state of the art technology for generalized routing of data.

Formerly known as Jabber, XMPP is an open, decentralized and extensible protocol for near-real-time XML data exchange; it is backed and formalized by IETF (RFCs 3920-3923, 4854, 4979, 5122) and further developed by the "XMPP Standards Foundation":http://xmpp.org/, with several mature implementations already available.

Our "XMPP for Event handling":http://dev.webinos.org/redmine/projects/wp3-1/wiki/XMPP_for_Event_handling state of the art analysis documents clearly outlines how it would be possible to satisfy most webinos’ functional requirements concerning remote notifications and messaging by simply adopting XMPP and requiring a specific set of XEPs to be supported by the implementations; furthermore, such a choice would also allow to reuse at least part of the already existing XMPP server-side infrastructure without modifications.

On the other hand, the scope of such analysis is strictly limited to the exchange of structured data (i.e., events) and does not take into account issues that are of fundamental importance in other functional areas.

Recommendations from state of the art
-------------------------------------

Given XMPP’s maturity and suitability for applications in many different contexts, the webinos’ event handling system will borrow a consistent set of concepts, features and technical solutions from such technology.

Such a strategy should also be of help in defining a bidirectional mapping between the two technologies for interoperability purposes, yet without creating unilateral or mutual interdependencies.
