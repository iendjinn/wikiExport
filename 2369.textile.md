NFC API
-------

### Overview of API

http://dev.webinos.org/redmine/projects/t3-4/wiki/NFC_API

Allows applications to read and write to NFC tags, to push messages to other NFC devices, and to establish a temporary bidirectional asynchronous message channel between the host device and another. NFC uses short range inductive radio frequency communication. The range is typically of the order of 4 centimetres. NFC tags lack batteries and are powered through inductive coupling. The webinos phase 2 API doesn’t (yet) support more advanced techniques such as APDU messages for contact and contact-less smart cards, as used for electronic payments.

### Threats

#### API-Specific threats and misuse cases

1.  Privacy and confidentiality loss - An attacker could place a hidden antenna near enough to listen into the communication protocol between the NFC devices as NFC communications is typically unencrypted. In practice with a hand held NFC device like a mobile phone, and a handheld NFC tag (e.g. a smart card), the risk is low.
2.  Loss of an NFC Tag - if data is held on an NFC Tag in an unencrypted form, there is a risk of the Tag falling into the wrong hands. This is analogous to losing a metro travel payment card (e.g. London’s Oyster card), a credit card or a security access card used for access to restricted premises. A related scenario involves the loss of your NFC enabled smart phone.

#### Threats based on remote invocation of this API from another device

For this to work, the user would have to be persuaded to cooperate with physically moving the NFC device close to the other device, e.g. a phone or tag.

#### Implementation threats and possible attacks

NFC is sometimes used to exchange credentials for securing other protocols, e.g. WiFi networks or Bluetooth connections. NFC has also been suggested as part of the process for inducting new devices into the user’s personal zone. Unencrypted communication between NFC devices could be used to compromise security, however, see above for the practical issues in doing so.

#### Threats to apps and developers using this API (E.g. Jimmy and Jessica)

NFC can be used as part of payment solutions, and web developers may feel unwarranted confidence in the security of NFC devices. We need to explain the limitations of basic NDEF NFC devices and point people are more secure solutions where appropriate, e.g. the use of NFC-SEC and APDU.

#### Threats to device manufacturers, operators, other stakeholders

1.  Availability - NFC is low power and not a big factor in battery life.

### Mitigations

The wireless connection can be safeguarded through the use of NFC-SEC as defined by ECMA-385 and ECMA 386, see:

-   "ECMA-385":http://www.ecma-international.org/publications/standards/Ecma-385.htm
-   "ECMA-386":http://www.ecma-international.org/publications/standards/Ecma-386.htm
-   "ECMA TC-47 NFC-SEC White paper":http://www.ecma-international.org/activities/Communications/tc47-2008-089-Rev1.pdf

_Note: ECMA 385, 385 have been republished as ISO/IEC 13157-1 and –2, respectively._

NFC-SEC provides for a Diffie-Helman secure key exchange, allowing NFC devices to set up a secure communication path. In principle, this could be subject to a man-in-the-middle attack, but that would be hard to achieve in practice due to the nature of the very short range radio frequency communication paths involved.

Further work is needed to explore how to integrate support for NFC-SEC in webinos, as this is dependent on the availability of support by the underlying libraries, e.g. libnfc and the Android SDK.

### Recommended default policy rules for applications

The need for users to explicitly bring NFC devices close together acts as barrier to silent abuse of the NFC APIs, as a result user consent shouldn’t be requested at run-time, except when the system needs to re-format an existing Tag. It may still be a good idea to ask users for consent to at install time as a reminder of the capability of the application in question.

The policy language could be designed to limit the APIs applications can use according to the need, e.g. if an application only needs to share personal contact data (an electronic business card) then it could be restricted to reading and writing such data to NFC devices/tags. The policy language could further limit the capabilities to applications that are authenticated by the host platform.
