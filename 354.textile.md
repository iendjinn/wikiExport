Low level implementation architecture (platform specific)
=========================================================

For example: Again considering Android, if we provide webinos above the
Android core libraries and Dalvik then the specification will be based on
Java supported environment and will require for example Java runtime
environment in all 4 domains. But if we address something in parallel to
Dalvik then we need to provide how Dalvik and Webinos runtime will run in
parallel. Keeping in mind that Dalvik type of functionality might be
relevant on all 4 domains. (Habib Virji)
