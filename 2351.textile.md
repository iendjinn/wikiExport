Revised NFC API
===============

This is a draft for a revised NFC API that is heavily inspired by work on PhoneGap

-   Convenience methods for specific tag types, e.g. with specific MIME type content
-   Write back to specific tag when several are in range
-   NDEF push, and LLCP peer to peer message channel
-   Set tag to read-only
-   Formatting unformatted tag left to the system to do, possibly with user prompt

Some open questions:

### The specific approach for registering event handlers

There are several possibilities:

1.  conventional DOM event handler on DOM tree, using addEventListener
2.  assigning a call back, but there can be only one call back
3.  calling a method on the NFC interface to add listeners

A further question is whether to synchronously raise an exception if there is a problem with accessing the NFC subsystem, or allow for a time delay via signalling success and failure in initializing NFC and registering a listener through call backs.

### How much information to provide on errors?

What information to provide in the failure call backs?

### Handling multiple tags

You may have multiple tags in your wallet, and applications need to be able to selectively access them. The PhoneGap model is for each tag to raise an event and to use the a tag interface to write back the same tag.

### Support for different NFC Technologies

The technical implications need to be looked at in a little more detail.

### APDU support

This is not covered in the API below, but is in scope for the W3C NFC Working Group. Further investigation is needed, and it seems unlikely that we will be able to resolve this for Deliverable 3.4.

WebIDL specification
--------------------

<pre>
// nfc.webidl - proposed NFC API inspired by PhoneGap
// Question: how to import DOMEvent and MessageChannel?

// the NFC interface would be implemented for the nfc
// property on the Webinos object supplied by webinos.js

interface NFC {
 // add generic listener for all NFC tag technologies
 void addListener(NfcEventCallBack listener,
 SuccessCallBack success, FailCallBack fail);

// add listener for NDEF tags with text record(s)
 void addTextTypeListener(NfcEventCallBack listener,
 SuccessCallBack success, FailCallBack fail);

// add listener for NDEF tags with URI record(s)
 void addUriTypeListener(NfcEventCallBack listener,
 SuccessCallBack success, FailCallBack fail);

// add listener for NDEF tags with MIME content record(s)
 void addMimeTypeListener(DOMString mimeType,
 NfcEventCallBack listener, SuccessCallBack success, FailCallBack fail);

// set device to push NDEF message to another NDEF device
 void shareTag(NfcNdefRecord[] message, SuccessCallBack success, FailCallBack fail);

// unset device from NDEF push sharing mode
 void unshareTag(SuccessCallBack success, FailCallBack fail);

// establish HTML MessageChannel with another device via LLCP
 void peer(LLCPCallBack success, FailCallBack fail);

// ancilliary methods for NDEF record payloads
 byte[] stringToBytes(DOMString string);

DOMString bytesToString(byte[] data);
};

// call back for NDEF events
callback NfcEventCallBack = void (NfcNdefEvent event);

// call back with associated operation has succeeded
callback SuccessCallBack = void ();

// call back with associated operation has failed
// Question: consider passing some information on the failure
callback FailCallBack = void ();

// call back when message channel has been established over LLCP
callback LLCPCallBack = void (MessageChannel channel);

// the NFC event has a single property â€” the NFC Tag
interface NfcNdefEvent : DOMEvent {
 readonly attribute NfcTag tag;
};

 void makeReadOnly(SuccessCallBack success, FailCallBack fail);
};

// call back when connection with tag is closed
// e.g. when user pulls the tag away from the reader
callback CloseCallBack = void ();

// enumeration of tag technologies
