shareTag
========

This is a method for setting a device into a sharing mode for pushing an NDEF message to another NDEF device.

<pre class="webidl prettyprint">
 // set device to push NDEF message to another NDEF device
 void shareTag(NfcNdefRecord[] message, SuccessCallBack success, FailCallBack fail);
</pre>

It makes use of the success and failure call back pattern. These call backs are defined in a subsequent section.
