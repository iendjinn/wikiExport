Security and Privacy Mission
----------------------------

The webinos project has security and privacy as a primary goal. In this section we attempt to define the broad, overall objective of security activities in webinos which help to define whether we have succeeded or not.

### Encouraging the development and deployment of secure web applications

-   Allow developer with good intentions to create secure applications without introducing new security overheads.
-   Create sensible default rules which make it harder to develop insecure applications and easier for users to protect themselves.
-   Introduce a secure personal network infrastructure which protects data in transit and properly authenticates endpoints, allowing for distributed applications which do not need to provide inter-application security features themselves.
-   Allow for the creation and use of secure distributed services based on shared web APIs

### Limiting the impact of insecure applications

-   Mobile and web malware is a genuine threat: webinos must try to mitigate the impact of a malicious application on a user’s devices.
-   Security requirements from all relevant stakeholders (as defined by the consortium) should be taken into account, including - manufacturers, users, developers and network operators.
-   Follow the principle of least privilege by making sure that applications define the privileges they are requesting and are given nothing more.
-   Allow for revocation of permissions by users who may change their mind about an application or component.

### Mitigating the most likely risks to user data and personal devices

-   Identify the key risks and threats and have convincing mitigations for as many as possible.
-   Make the remaining risks public by sharing the security analysis and source data.
-   Make assumptions and expectations on other components clear.
-   Make security and privacy part of the design process - influence the architecture such that key risks are balanced against functionality.

### Making sure that webinos only enhances online privacy

-   Limit the potential for webinos to be used to fingerprint end users and reveal personally identifiable information without consent.
-   Create APIs which reveal only the data that developers require, and no more.
-   Minimize the potential for surprise generated by new multi-device information sharing.
-   Encourage the storage of personal data in areas owned by the user, both for their sake and for developers data handling obligations.

### Ensuring that the security and privacy functionality within webinos does not conflict with usability

-   Design based on a consistent set of personas, assets, threats and attackers.
-   Balance the need for informed user consent with expectations: enable safe APIs where sensible and highlight those where additional consideration is required.
-   Avoid the impact of ‘click through’ such that goal-orientated users are not expected to make all-or-nothing decisions about access control.

### Providing security and privacy features in an open environment

-   Allow for open source development without sacrificing the integrity of the security and privacy architecture
-   Create security and privacy controls which are appropriate for the web and do not depend solely on a closed ecosystem such as an ‘app store’
