Discussion:
# How to register users?
**** either by facebook or SIM, needed for RD
**** Nick: every user has its own identity manager; should not be too much service driven, risk
**** Nick: personal zone has proxy for the individual identity, can be hosted anywhare
*** suppports: U can identified against it, can be addressed, knows what devices are online, used as entity to discover devices
*** can be provided by multiple different providers (e.g. to establish relationship between users on social networks; requires these SN to provice some of this functionality)
*** Katrin: does that involve additional info on the user, e.g. services which are running on the u’s devices
*** Nick: personal zone/proxy as AC protected; U has to authenticate access which then may allow another U’ to access U’s contacts
*** Nick: personal zone proxy acts like HTTP server; discovery: user inputs home address on a new device to connect it to the personal zone (rather than user name and password), for discovering friends, a Facebook app is used and it finds another user U’ as U* registered his home zone address on Facebook
*** Nick: we should support the distributed model as far as possible to support commercial diversity
*** Nick: in entirely distributed IDM, user discovery service a loosely coupled service used to find users, can be implemented by Facebook, an enterprise, a loal socker club
*** Nick: either centralised user reg or a thired party (e.g. Skype) who knows the user and maps to the address of the home zone
*** Nick: user either knows something (e.g. an ID) or an existing (Skype) relationship is upscaled to a webinos relationship
*** Nick: user registers against personal proxy and the proxy registers against one or more services (e.g. Facebook and Skype); the proxy knows credentials for all these 3rd party services to register there
*** Nick: we should have an example service in webinos but not limit to it for commercial reasons
*** Nick: should create a thin user discovery API which requires a name and returns addresses where the user is reachable right now
*** Katrin: phone book on the phone can be used to address people? Nick: forward lookup is needed to derive home address from hotmail e-mail address
*** webinos ID should become just another "feature" of the user, such as his e-mail address and Facebook ID
*** Andrea: in our AA we have a webinos identity (WID); Nick’s proposal uses any (3rd party) identity; a personal zone can be integrated in the AA as a possible scenario; with a central entity we have an entity which can garantee a certain level of trust, Nick’s proposal is very Web-oriented and loose, which is perfect but it is more difficult to establish trust relationships --> we should have both personal zone + centralised entity for sensible communication
*** Nick: weak point: spoofing of personal zones
*** Nick: strong authentication with personal zone of U may fix that

* Further steps
**** Nick will go through the other open issues by e-mail
**** key questions- should be got out in a persistent form until 27 Apr
*** where is IDM hosted
*** how to discover user
*** how to discover devices of a user
**** discussion on technical details about the AA between DOCOMO and Polito and any other party who is interested on Thu 9:30
***** understand the consequences of the personal zone and the identity management proxy hosted there

Next meeting: conf call on 28 Apr 9:30 - 10:30 CEDT
