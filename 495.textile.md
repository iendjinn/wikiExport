Policy Protection
=================

If the device supports a private folder in the internal storage, we can store policies in this folder and sign them in order to guarantee authenticity and integrity.

State of Art
------------

### BONDI

In BONDI policies are stored in xml fragments secured by the XML Signature Syntax and Processing (Second Edition) [http://www.w3.org/TR/xmldsig-core/]: â€œThis document specifies XML digital signature processing rules and syntax. XML Signatures provide integrity, message authentication, and/or signer authentication services for data of any type, whether located within the XML that includes the signature or elsewhere.â€

Open issues
-----------

-   What if a device cannot store policies in a private folder, or cannot store them at all?
-   Trusting remote PAP
-   Avoid tampering during synchronization and update processes
