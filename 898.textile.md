Deliverable Writing
-------------------

Maintaining and updating the glossary has been moved from Matthias (who did a great job on this for WP 2) to Krishna and Simon for WP3.

Exporting tools
---------------

Dieter Blomme had been charged (assisted by Alexander Futasz) to modify the redmine and export tools to resolve known (and upcoming) problems when exporting the deliverable(s) from Redmine to Word.

Review tasks
------------

For each section of the deliverable there have been two reviewers resigned who (as far as possible) weren’t involved in the original writing of that section.

Comments should be made in some easily recognizable form (different foreground or background color) and give some indication who wrote it (easier than browsing the history…)

Like this. (Christian Fuhrhop)
