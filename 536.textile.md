Device Discovery High Level Architecture
========================================

**THIS DOCUMENT IS WORK IN PROGRESS**

The goal of the high level architecture presented here is to enable discussion on design decisions regarding device discovery (and possibly broader).

Throughout the text, important issues that should be addressed are indicated like so:
|![](Discuss.png)|**Discussion required**|To be or not to be, what is the question?|

Note that everything in this document is subject to change and in no way represents some final view. It also should not be regarded as a design, but merely a sequence of issues that need be addressed in the near future.

Approach
--------

A somewhat complete picture of device discovery is painted here based on a number of scenario’s using a number of different actors and devices. Read on!

Assumptions
-----------

-   Installing webinos on a device (the process of securely retrieving, installing and configuring the runtime) is a separate issue. In other words: only after initial setup a device is considered discoverable
-   Service discovery and device discovery are branches on the same tree. Nevertheless only the latter is addressed here.
-   All webinos devices have a runtime installed that is capable of connecting to the webinos cloud (which - in this context - is an abstract central administration thingy).
-   All users have a unique ID (which is not to be confused with their name)
-   All devices with a webinos runtime have a unique ID (which is not to be confused with their name)
-   Applications are web only, and not delivered by webinos but use webinos through JavaScript APIs

  ------------------ ------------------------- ----------------------------------------------------------
  ![](Discuss.png)   **Discussion required**   Are these assumptions accurate? Spurious? Any omissions?
  ------------------ ------------------------- ----------------------------------------------------------

Comments on the Assumptions by Sven:
* Assumption 1: Agreed. We from the User Identity sub-topic group will have to see how users and devices will obtain their IDs and how joining users and devices to webinos should work. As always, we are open for suggestions!
* Assumption 3: I’m afraid there is a double assignment of the term _webinos cloud_ in the project. It is also used to summarise all the devices which belong to the same user and which are interconnected. I believe it is better to use anther term. **It is necessary to flesh out ASAP what this central entity actually means/does.** We’ll need that to further refine our work. I was hoping that Discovery and/or the Overlay Network will be capable of discovering the central online entity of webinos once there is Internet access for a device. What is the purpose of this online entity from your perspective? The User Identity group has planned to have a registrar and an Identity Provider as online entities which cover various features. Please see our [[User_ID_and_Data_Management_Discussion|User Identity and Data Management Discussion page]] for details.
* Assumptions 4 and 5: what is the difference between ID and name? A name can also be an ID.
* Assumption 6: this is also my understanding.

Comments on the comments on the Assumptions by Sven by Victor :-) :
* Ad 3) true, webinos cloud means a lot. Personally I see the federation of webinos servers as the webinos cloud. E.g. if we decide to go with XMPP the webinos cloud would be the collection of all federated XMPP servers on the world that are running the webinos plugin.
* Ad 4 and 5) An ID is an identifier, a computer-usable name. A name is a human-readable name. I can imagine that devices have both, in which case we would need to support aliases (a user would only bother giving names to devices/services/apps that they can actually see and that have some importance to them). The important confusion to avoid is that between names and addresses though.

h2. Overview

h3. Actors

The following actors play a role in our device discovery scenario’s:

![](DeviceDiscoveryActors.png)

|User|a person with a legal relationship with a webinos service provider that has installed or is about to install the webinos runtime on at least one device|
|Family Member|a person that shares a household with a webinos user|
|Friend w/ Webinos|a person with whom a webinos user has a special trust relationship with and has a webinos account of himself|
|Friend wo/ Webinos|a person with whom a webinos user has a special trust relationship with and does NOT have a webinos account|

Note that the purpose of the family member is **to model everyone with whom a webinos user has some kind of relation that may disturb a clean modeling of webinos and webinos devices**. For example, a family member may be co-owner and co-user of a PVR.

|![](Discuss.png)|**Discussion required**|Do we need all of the actors above or stick to users only, or users and friends, or …?|

Comments on the Actors by Sven:
* I believe the Family Member is strongly required. There is interaction with this person in many ways which we have to model:
**** Family Member also uses the device while not being a webinos user (as described in the discussion here).
**** Family Member is a webinos user like the User and they both use the PVR. There is an issue of identification and authentication.
* Family members typically have unlimited rights to use and access the devices in the household whereas friends or others may only have temporary access.
* I believe we need to distinguish three cases. They have implications on identification, authentication and discovery.
**** Case 1: a device is just used by one user = owner (e.g. smartphone)
**** Case 2: a device is used by multiple equal users (e.g. PVR)
**** Case 3: some functionality of a device is (temporarily) used by another person (e.g. media gallery on the smartphone by a friend).

Comments on these comments by Victor:
* Good points. The current formulated family member is specifically _not_ a webinos user though. With actors it is best to not mix them up.
* So the question becomes (see also your case 2): should webinos support co-owned devices natively, or should we model a different user?
* cases 1 and 3 should be supported by webinos, no question about that!

h3. Devices

The actors above use and/or own a couple of devices:

![](DeviceDiscoveryActorsWithDevices.png)

First of all we see a regular webinos user, who has two devices: a smartphone and an in-car PC. The latter offers navigation, media, has support for camera’s (front and/or back) etc. They are both fully webinos enabled and connect to the webinos cloud.

The family member of the regular webinos user is here to create havoc, as explained above. He (or she) uses the PVR, that has webinos installed. The installed webinos runtime connects to the cloud, but the family member is not a webinos user.

The webinos user has two friends; one who also has a webinos account, and another one that doesn’t.

Of course the actors may own and use other devices as well but these are not depicted here and neither are part of the scenario’s below.

In addition, there exist devices that are not part of webinos but that can be used by webinos users and- policies allowing - others. These are reachable over LANs (e.g. WiFi) and PANs (Personal Area Networks, e.g. Bluetooth) and hence require a webinos device with compatible communication skills to proxy for them, like so:

![](DeviceDiscoveryDevices.png)

Three user devices of which only the UPnP Thermostat has no sense of webinos. Still, it can be used by the smartphone through webinos.

### Modeling Users and Devices

Users and Devices are not the same. Still, it is difficult to model these in a reality-aware manner. Sometimes, e.g. with smartphones, the device and the user of that device _are_ considered the same; ‘your’ phone number, etc. In situations like these often the user perspective is that they are the same while the technical perspective leaves the user unmodeled.

When modeling users and devices as separate, usability may be at stake. For example, how could you make a distinction between users when you are behind a television? Have each user login?

For webinos, we should at a technical level assume that users and devices are different, but allow a default owner (or take some other technical measure) so as to cater for situations where users in reality assume equalness.

  ------------------ ------------------------- ----------------------------
  ![](Discuss.png)   **Discussion required**   What is your view on this?
  ------------------ ------------------------- ----------------------------

Comments on Identification by Sven:
* I fully agree: users and devices are different. If you have a communication application (e.g. IM) you need to address the user. Thus the user needs to be reachable via a certain device or multiple devices. This is why we intend to have the registrar. I believe it depends on the use case whether it suffice to only identify the owner, to identify all the users of a device and to identify the device.
* Please have a look at our "Questions from User Identity and User Data Mgmt to Discovery forum entry":http://dev.webinos.org/redmine/boards/7/topics/20, as we are discussing similar questions.

Scenarios
---------

### Terminology and Scope

Device discovery includes:
* **existence** - is a device part (directly or by proxy) of the webinos realm? (Usually consequence of being registered.)
* **connectivity** - is it reachable, and if so against what costs?
* **availability** - is it not being used by someone else?

Of course the question of device **capabilities** (what can I do with it?) is important as well but is to be addressed as part of service discovery.

### Overview

In the remainder of this section, the following scenario’s are addressed:

Regarding **existence**:
* Installing Webinos runtime
* Registering with webinos cloud
* Running an application on a webinos-enabled device
* Using a thermostat in the home network while being somewhere else

Regarding **connectivity**:
* Recovering from a lost connection
* Trusting another user while being offline

Regarding **availability**:
* Programming the PVR while someone else is using it

  ------------------ ------------------------- ------------------------------------
  ![](Discuss.png)   **Discussion required**   Are there scenario’s missing here?
  ------------------ ------------------------- ------------------------------------

### SCENARIO - Installing Webinos runtime

Installing webinos is a three step process:
# securely fetch an instance of the webinos runtime installer, e.g. through use of a secured app store, or through a direct download.
# run the downloaded installer and approve requested priviledges
# enter personal info

As a result, the system will generate and distribute all required public and private keys for the device. If it is a first time install, additional questions may be posed by the installed, e.g. regarding default policies to use, e-mail address etc. Also, additional public/private keys may be generated for other purposes.

The installation process may very well require a live data connection and use email for verification purposes.

Note that designing the installation process is not part of this section, but is given here for illustrative purposes only.

### SCENARIO - Registering with webinos cloud

When data connectivity is available, the process of registering looks like this:

![](DeviceDiscoveryRegister.png)

The register command as issued by the user may be implicit, e.g. as a result of installing the webinos runtime while giving it permissions to load at device boot.

Peer notification is not made explicit, but can be considered an asynchronous activity initiated by a register command and performed by the webinos cloud.

Sometimes, a connection with the webinos cloud may not be available, or only through great expenses (e.g. while roaming). The scenario would then unfold like so:

![](DeviceDiscoveryRegisterLocally.png)

Processing the registration activity is thus delegated to a local module. A system capable of that could look like so:

![](DeviceDiscoveryPolicyManagement.png)

Part of the policy is probably enforced on the device. A remote policy manager uses a live data connection with the webinos cloud to negoriate/agree/etc on some other parts, and to retrieve updated certificates etc. When a data connection is not available, a local policy manager enforces what is usually done by the cloud, based on synchronised policies and keys. It can be imagined that some sort of ‘freshness’ applies to the cached trust information.

### SCENARIO - Running an application on a webinos-enabled device

An application has to ‘discover’ webinos for itself too. Assumed is that webinos offers no apps; these come from the greater web:

![](DeviceDiscoveryWebApp.png)

Note that the ‘register’ block indicates that at that point in time registration of all applicable devices occurs.

The fetched page in this example could have contained the following snippet:

<pre><code class="javascript">
 <head>
 <script language="JavaScript">

// show all devices on page.
 // param array with devices
 function showDevices(a) {
 // code here
 }

if ("Webinos" in window) {
 showDevices( this.webinos.owner.devices );
 }
 </script>
 . . .
</code></pre>

The application running on the webinos-enabled browser discovers the existence of webinos much like it would discover the existence of html5 websockets.

The current device list may be available on the device itself (e.g. because it has a fast connection all changes may be instantly pushed, and it knows that) or it may delegate this request to the webinos cloud. The figure above assumes the first.

### SCENARIO - Using a thermostat in the home network while being somewhere else

In the home network, webinos devices may try to discover other (non-webinos) devices. For example, a PVR might use UPnP discovery like so:

![](DeviceDiscoveryDiscoverLocal.png)

Firstly, it broadcasts a M-SEARCH message over the network indicating that it is searching for other UPnP devices. Then, the UPnP thermostat responds with a NOTIFY, indicating its address and capabilities. Not in this picture is querying the thermostat device on capabilities, temperature etc. Secondly, the PVR updates its local device list to the webinos cloud.

In case a user wants to know the temperature at home, it can do a query using his smartphone like so:

![](DeviceDiscoveryRemoteThermostat.png)

As we saw earlier, the UPnP thermostat - which includes a temperature sensor - is found on the local network. The users’ smartphone has to discover it, and in this example the browser on it loads a page with a suitable app (or from cache, not depicted here) which contains javascript:

<pre><code class="javascript">
 <head>
 <script language="JavaScript">
 function showTemperature(a) {
 // code here
 }

if ("Webinos" in window) {
 a = this.webinos.owner.devicesByCapability["QueryTemperature"]; // get all devices that can give temperature reading
 b = this.webinos.owner.devicesByLocation[""]; // get all devices in the home
 c = a.union(b); // calculate all devices that have both
 showTemperature( c[0].queryTemp() ); // use first available device
 }
 </script>
 . . .
</code></pre>

Now the correct device has been found, and queryTemp() has been issued on it. Back to the sequence diagram above: the browser has javascript which is executed by the webinos runtime which forwards the message over XMPP to the webinos cloud (the XMPP server) which on its turn forwards it to the PVR inthe home. Finally, the UPnP proxy in it translates the message, sends it over the home network, gets the response and sends that back. Note that the XMPP messaging is specifically designed for webinos.

### SCENARIO - Programming the PVR while someone is using it

### SCENARIO - Recovering from a lost connection

### SCENARIO - Trusting another user while being offline

Previous stuff, copy when needed to correct location
----------------------------------------------------

We introduce only the standard actors, underneath technology can be changed as per the requirements. For example, IP address is one of the actor, what technology it uses underneath is independent such as DHCP, mDNS or AutoIP.

Most of the device discovery packet exchange mechanism is traditionally multicast. Each device is responsible for updating about its discovery.

Actors involved
---------------

# User
# Browser (Based on MIME type, browser initialize and load webinos extension). This mechanism can change and is a just a general reference to how browser handles extension.
# Discovery Process: Main process that handles the decision unit, local broker and remote broker.

### High Level Architecture

The below diagram covers only device already registered, it does not include first time registered device.

![](DD_HighLevelArch.jpg)

### Decision Unit

Criteria for checking proximity
* Device located locally or remotely
After IP address is obtained following steps will be performed
* Network Criteria
**** Device Description - Device type, name, unique id, URL to address the device
**** Networking Technology - Wireless, wired, paid services
**** Addressing route - maximum number of hops
* Proximity
**** Close/Physical proximity: Distance between discovered device and current device location. In case of fixed device it could be through the number of hops it requires while in WiFi it could be device connected under same AP.
**** Physical location: GeoLocation API to find current location of the device. If offline, the last location could be used.
**** Social proximity: Depends on how context data is available.
* User
**** User ID
**** Device owned by particular UserID
**** Find other devices based on UserID
* Policies
**** Security

### Local Discovery

Local Discovery involves (Based on UPnP/ could be added with information as required by ZeroConf)
# IP address resolution
#* Could be done using IP AUTO or mDNS resolve mechanism
#* ZeroConf scenario of performing the IP address check
# Device Discovery
#* Requires type
#* Need device id /user id. Mapping between user id and device id.
#* URL for describing services.
#* SSPD or DNS query can be used,
# Description
#* Each root device description
#* Each embedded device in root device description
#* Each service provided by each embedded device and variable that describes state.
#* Each IP enabled interface should provide its description and service it provides .

### Remote Discovery

# Resolve device located remotely
#* Depending on user id/device id and authentication with the
#* Resolve with XMPP server about the location of device.
#* Establish communication with device running using user ID
#* Fetch information about device type, device id, service URL.
# Fetch description of the service URL based on the device.
# Event and control mechanism using XMPP protocol.

### Connection Manager

Connect to the device and able to access device. This unit could be responsible for loading driver, use application layer protocol to communicate with device or use UPnP service description.
