UI Approaches
=============

{{toc}}

Introduction
------------

User interface that can be highly optimized for all the platforms TV, Mobile, In-Car device and PC without affecting the quality. The UI Displays same content using different layout, structural elements.

Things to do
------------

-   Show same content sets across other platforms
-   To specify adaption techniques like Pagination, Structural techniques and apply on the fragments of the Content
-   To have same Navigation on different devices and design for device clusters and fragments that can be used across different devices
-   Use of device specific markup
-   To have device profiles so that the Content can be Adapted based on the identification
-   Screen sizes categorized by frequency

Design Process
--------------

-   Design User Interfaces for devices using XHTML and CSS using scalable single authoring approach
-   Developing an Adaptive user Interface fragment (Interface Adaptation or Transformer) for different device screens
-   Show and hide content based on the devices and navigate according to it and using morphing techniques
-   Paginate large number of text, break into small sections
-   Displaying same content using different layout, structural elements
-   Reduce large tables of tabular data for smaller devices
-   Convert navigation (list of links, etc.) to different form to have interaction behavior in different devices or browsers
-   Format masks and Specify Navigational Relationships
-   Show the appropriate version of image, audio, video for each platform
-   Using better tools for Iterative UI design

Design Methodology
------------------

-   Create High Precision UIs that can be controllable
-   Design for device clusters, fragments that may be reused across multiple devices
-   Specify adaptation techniques to apply on fragments like Pagination, Structural Transformation, etc.

**Sequence of Adaptation**:

**Pagination**

![](paginate.jpg)

-   Break large bodies of content into sections that can be displayed on multiple pages at runtime
-   Content Inclusion and Exclusion: Show and hide content based on connecting device class and modularize fragments of the application Show device or specific navigation
-   Exclude large areas of page layout: Tables often used to control layout structures, Lists

UI Development using jQueryMobile
---------------------------------

**Cross-platform & cross-device**: Instead of writing unique apps for each mobile device or OS, the jQuery mobile framework will allow you to design a single highly branded and customized web application that works on all platforms. It is feasible to use JQuery Framework since it supports iOS, Windows Phone, Android

**Touch-optimized layouts & UI widgets**: Dynamic touch interfaces that will adapt to a range of devices, the system will include both layouts (lists, detail panes, overlays) and a rich set of form controls and UI widgets (toggles, sliders, tabs).

**CSS framework**: To have the power to design full applications. support for more CSS3 properties.

**jQuery Mobile**: Touch-Optimized Web Framework for Smartphones & Tablets A unified user interface system across all popular mobile device platforms, Provides lightweight code that is built with progressive enhancement.
* jQuery Mobile event handling, Methods and Utilities, Data attribute reference and Theme Framework [1]
* jQuery Mobile UI - The UI is declared by using HTML 5 style "data-role". This makes the UI development a breeze. Building a prototype of jQuery Mobile UI (wireframe) would not require any coding, but just html tags.

**jQuery Mobile API**: Consists Page Loading, Transition, Dialog box handling, List View manipulation, item click and so on [2].

**Code Example**:

-   Include needed Javascript and CSS

<pre>
<head>

<link rel="stylesheet" href="/jquery.mobile-1.0a1.min.css" />
<script src="jquery-1.4.3.min.js"></script>
<script src="jquery.mobile-1.0a1.min.js"></script>

</head>
</pre>

-   Declare different Pages, Header and Navigation

<pre>
<body>

<div data-role="page" id="home">
 …..
 </div>

<div data-role="page" id="search">
 …..
 </div>

<div data-role="page" id="recent">
 …..
 </div>

</body>
</pre>

**Features** [2]

-   Built on jQuery core for familiar and consistent jQuery syntax leverages jQuery UI code and patterns.
-   Compatible with all major mobile, tablet, desktop platforms
-   Lightweight size and minimal image dependencies for speed and Modular architecture for creating custom builds.
-   HTML5 Markup-driven configuration of pages and behavior for fast development and minimal required scripting.
-   Progressive enhancement approach brings core content and functionality to all mobile
-   codebase to automatically scale from smartphone to desktop-sized screens.
-   Powerful Ajax-powered navigation system for animated page transitions with back button.
-   Touch and mouse event support, mouse and cursor focus-based user input methods with a simple API.
-   Unified UI widgets for common controls, themable controls that are platform-agnostic and easy to use.
-   Powerful theming framework

**jQuery mobile handling the Issues**:

-   Scrollbar issues - to start below header and end above footer [3]
-   Header and Footer issues to be fixed [3]

iUI - User Interface (UI) Framework for WebApp development
----------------------------------------------------------

iUI is a framework consisting of a JavaScript library, CSS, and images for developing advanced mobile webapps. Made with only iPhone in mind in the first place (reason of i UI), now supports most smartphones & tablets.

**iUI has the following features**:

-   Create Navigational Menus and iPhone-style interfaces from standard HTML
-   Use or knowledge of JavaScript is not required to create modern mobile web pages
-   Ability to handle phone orientation changes
-   Provide a more "iPhone-like" experience in your Web apps

**Lightweight**:

iUI doesn’t come with dozens of transitions styles or hundreds of built-in UI elements like you can find in bigger frameworks like JQueryMobile or Sencha. And this is on purpose. Since iUI wants keep core code as lightweight as possible [4].

**HTML Markup**:

-   iUI is just plain HTML, CSS and Javascript.
-   No compilation, no code generation, no alteration [4].

qooxdoo Mobile
--------------

qx.Mobile is qooxdoo’s mobile framework. It provides specific UI classes for touch devices, handling of mobile events like swiping, and specific styling. It is suitable for various mobile web browsers on iOS and Android platforms.

**Features** [5]

-   Mobile widget set
-   Theming via CSS and LESS
-   iOS theme
-   Android theme
-   Touch events: touchstart, touchmove, touchend, touchcancel
-   Gesture events: swipe, tap
-   Animations between pages
-   Touch event emulation for debugging in desktop browsers
-   Fixed toolbars and momentum scrolling via iScroll
-   Basic PhoneGap support

**Development**:

**Mobile and tablet switch, Tablet support out of the box**: It provides a detection of device type the application runs on. Based upon this distinction the page manager navigation pages are optimized for device class mobile

**To get device type and enable device-based layouting**: The device type is accessible by the environment variable ‘device.type’

The device-based layouting is handled by qx.ui.mobile.page.Manager.

**Example**:

<pre>
var isTablet = false;
var manager = new qx.ui.mobile.page.Manager(isTablet);
var page = new qx.ui.mobile.page.NavigationPage();
manager.addDetail(page);
page.show();
</pre>

The manager has an optional constructor parameter isTablet. It indicates whether the page manager uses the mobile or the tablet layouting mode. In this examples, It shows the deactivated tablet layout mode with isTablet=false. If parameter isTablet is not defined at constructor, the page manager always calls environment variable device.type to determine the layout mode. Tablet layout mode is active by default, if environment variable is desktop or tablet [5].

**page manager arrange pages and layout modes**: There are 3 different layouting modes that ‘qx.ui.mobile.page.Manager’ offers [5].

-   Mobile Layout
-   Tablet Landscape Layout
-   Tablet Portrait Layout

**Example**:

<pre>
var manager = new qx.ui.mobile.page.Manager();

var masterPage = new qx.ui.mobile.page.NavigationPage();
var detailPage1 = new qx.ui.mobile.page.NavigationPage();
var detailPage2 = new qx.ui.mobile.page.NavigationPage();

manager.addMaster(masterPage);
manager.addDetail([detailPage1,detailPage2]);

masterPage.show();
detailPage1.show();
</pre>

**Theming**

-   CSS and LESS: Theming in qooxdoo mobile is done with LESS and CSS. LESS is an extension for CSS to enable style sheets to be more dynamic. In LESS you can you use variables, reuse CSS statement inside of CSS file, import CSS files and create mixins [5].

For example the LESS mixin for border-radius:

<pre>
.border-radius() {
 -webkit-border-radius: `arguments;
    -moz-border-radius: `arguments;
 border-radius: @arguments;
}
</pre>

This mixin helps you creating border-radius for most browsers, just by writing something like:

<pre>
.border-radius(4px);
</pre>
