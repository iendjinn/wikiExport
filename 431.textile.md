Minutes for Tuesday, 22nd of February
Main purpose of today is to get the documents in shape for delivery next week.
**First deliverable: 2.3 Landscape and IPR**
Presented by Andreas Constantinou, VisionMobile

Document looking at 37 platforms and initiatives
Also looking at governance models
Presentation of research methodology of deliverable
Based on comparative template
Based also on platform-partner assignment
While the mobile market is often seen as a three horse race, it actually
is more like a ten horse race - we need to be aware of the ‘hidden horses’ as well.
There are many platforms coming and going - we need to keep watching the course.
Analysed large number of parameters across all 37 initiatives
Peer reviewed afterwards - every section reviewed by at least two partners
Conclusion and recommendations added.
Resulting in a final report of 300+ pages.
Some comments have not been addressed, conclusions need to be beefed up.
Draft has been already submitted. final version (make that FINAL version) by mid-March latest.
Currently in-progress: Use-case gap analysis
OS success is only partly based on API and SDK. The success mainly is based
on ecosystem viability.
Success metric is application & developer ecosystem.
Point in case: The number of applications that Symbian got in six years, Apple got in six months.
Nokia didn’t understand the importance of ecosystems early enough.
Android - 150000 apps, Apple 300000 apps, Windows only about 30000 apps - about the
same number that Symbian had - used to be a huge number three years ago, not so hot
in todays market.
Market is changing fast these days.
Recommendation: Use the Web as the ecosystem - easy accessible and most of the
work has already been done.
Mobile domain is currently leading in terms of ecosystem and production.
PC follows, then CE, TV, finally automotive.
Need to especially keep an eye on the mobile market to predict developments on
other markets.
Question Hans: Is the reason for more Apple success more pixels on screen than on Nokia?
One consideration, but also due to fact that TV is more closed and highly DRM conscious,
while mobiles are much more open. (Seems to answer a different question than the one asked.)
Apple has only 25% free apps, Android about 57% (?) - effect of app curation strategy by Apple.

Curation is a BUSINESS model, Android more long tail oriented.
iPhone is like BMW or Mercedes - similar market percentage, but high value/revenue.
Next issue: Fragmentation
Platform fragmentation is significant and here to stay due to commercial silos.
Effort for developers is three to six months to adapt to new platform properly.
Creating huge inertia to stay with a platform one chosen.
Developer acquisition cost is significant higher than user acquisition cost.
Need by platform providers to keep developers and lock them in on the platform once they
are acquired.
Change still possible: Flash runs on 1.4 billion devices and it’s on it’s way out.
Advantages of web based approach:
Mostly IPR unencumbered
Able to use existing assets
Public roadmaps vie W3C
Low entry barrier
Large assets (everyone has web sites)
Large skill base
Easy to deploy, quick to write
Hype-ready platform
Regarding roadmaps: Why does nobody leak Apple secrets - Apple agressively sues employees who leak information.
W3C does not do that…
Skill base 65000 apple developers - web developers at least 10 times more
"Hype-ready" - note the amount of money that MS spends on marketing Windows 7 - 500 Million dollars

Web based might have cost less, since the base is seen as fundamentally benevolent.
Disadvantages of web applications
Slow progress
Partial fragmentations
Make sure that we don’t worsen fragmentation

Hype-ready might cut both ways - might be disadvantage or an advantage.

Hype creates a cloud of expectations that needs to be bridged with reality.

Web vs. Native is not an either/or choice.
Both can co-exist and it’s a case of using the right tool for the job.
But while web components were the ‘also ran’, they are now becoming first class components
of native technologies.
Significant gaps that webinos can/should/must exploit:
Access of local data on device.
Dealing with connection status changes and adapting dynamically to online/offline/bad connection
changes without visible service interruption (as far as possible) to users.
And handling of security applications of those issues.
API glue to handle connectivity is missing. Too many applications are written on simulators
on PC where connectivity is perfect. This can lead to problematic behavior ‘in the field’.
Governance:
Platforms have historically been closed.
Now both (Apple iOS/closed, Android/open) are successful in the market.
Best practice for webinos should be:
Access to source code without discrimination
Developer support mechanisms
Roadmap should be visible, open and preferably ask for contributions
Decision making processes (such as minutes/discussions) should be openly visible to all
Code contribution guidelines should be clear and simple
If you want community to develop source code, you need to treat developers fairly.
Need to build ‘tree of trust’ - system needs to be people-centric, not corporate centric.

Contributers should be public - it should be visible who drives the development.
Symbian - of the 140 packages being a part of it, all but one package was from Nokia.
And that last package was meaningless.
It’s clear who ‘guarded the gates’.
Possible risk due to ‘dormant contributors’ who commit at one phase, get a level
of authority at that point and then stop contributing, but use their authority to
resist/stop changes to elements/structures they have committed.
Although there are many, many others fires to fight before we get there.
We need to keep that issue in mind, but no high urgency now.

We need to define recommendations to deal with derivatives.
Since it’s open source, everyone can port ‘incomplete’ or ‘variant’ webinos
on devices - we need to define some compliance rules and give the ‘webinos Trademark’
only to compliant implementations.
Community structure should be as equitable as possible, avoid tiered rights/access
as far as possible.
- end of presentation -
Peter: Some more work on gap analysis is needed, also a better look at non-mobile markets.
Currently the deliverable is a bit mobile heavy.
Maybe we should keep the deliverable alive even after submission.
Might not be needed that much for WP2, but would be very helpful for dissemination and
possibly exploitation purposes.
Openness is a currency of benevolence and you can buy a lot of things with this currency, including PR.
How do we present that at the review?
Should we give this presentation more time than the one for other deliverables?
Peter: No, probably not. Use cases has much more PM work going into it.
Reviewers might pay more attention to that.
Ayse: I have been recently been reviewing. Reviewers will have read the deliverables - yet another
mega-recap is not really necessary. Reviewers are much more interested in ‘project dynamics’ (are

partners working well together, are all voices heard, is there one partner dominating the
project, is there one person answering all the questions) than in minutae of resource management.
As long as there is a good answer to resource questions, the review usually moves on, critical are
only issues where the partners are seen to be oblivious to unplanned resource spending or are
not able to justify such spendings. If resource allocation changes are justifiable, they are not
a big ‘pain point’.

**Next session - after coffee break - Developer experience insights**
Similar approach as with Industry Landscape - information collection based on pre-defined template
to make correlation of points and structuring easier.
Insights are from all four domains.

Presentation will only present the insights, not the conclusions for webinos
Mobile developer experinces
Runtime version fragmentation
Multiple app stores
Device, browser, runrime compatibility
Localisation
Analytics
UI development
Run time version fragmentation - different versions of the same platform
Run-time compatibility - same version on devices with different features
Automotive has very different set of problems
No app store - provisioning is an issue
Different API sets, one or two stages behind mobile
UI development/debugging/testing, almost from the ‘dark ages’ - ten years ago compared to PCs
Connectivity is more instable than for other domains
Lifecycle handling currently almost non existing, headunit software often needs to be updated as
a block, no individual app updates.
TV domain
relatively new area
Currently hyped.
At the moment in an experimentation phase.
Platform are not chosen by developer, but nearly almost by comissioner.
Lack of processing power - set-top boxes are weak on resources (speed as well as memory).
New mobile announced with 2.1 GHz last week - for TVs we’re talking 300 MHz.
Cross platform compatibility is not a significant issue at the moment, developers
are still willing to port.
PC domain
Very, very diverse development scene, difficult to summarize properly.
But since PCs are essentially always connected, applications shift to the cloud/backend with
PCs (often) being more UI devices than processing devices.
Main needs seem to be server-side debugging and provision of complex UI across platforms,
even with (or possibly even because of) CSS.
Note: Interviews should be refered to as structured, not qualitative (for formal reasons the
interviews don’t match the definiton of a qualitative interview, partly due to not being done
on location).
Next presentation: Matthias
Requirements and Developers Experience
Specifically Requirements section of D2.2
Requirements were derived from wiki tables and Word document have been created from those tables.
Number of columns has been reduced for readability and some have been mainly for review use.
Maybe we should remove use case reference column as well for readability.
Some parts from the Glossary still need definitions.
Mainly due to terms being used in requirements and not defined in the glossary.
Goal for the afternoon:
Finalize requirements section
Need to decide which of the ‘for deletion’ requirements need to be kept.
Either companies having ‘to be deleted’ requirements should reconsider the requirements on
whether we really need them or we should work in small groups (similar to Munich) and decide in groups.
We need to check again whether we match the DoW.
Describe the future of the document after the submission (further updates)
Problem with DoW: We didn’t really list only requirements going beyond the state of the art.
We need to address that.
Also need to align functional areas with themes from 3.1., or at least explain/justify the
differences to avoid confusion during review (and in dissemination).
Process from now on (after submission): Establish rules for change requests for existing
requirements - should be reasonably formal and not ad-hoc.
Might be an ammendmend to the DoW or documented somewhere else as long as it is reasonably binding
for contributers.
Finally work to be done:
Abstract, introduction and conclusions need to be written.
Ajit volunteered for the abstract (already before the session).
Oxford: We need to arrive at a good definition of the scope of the requirements - a subgroup
should write something like this, otherwise we’re open to ridicule/questions from reviewers.
At the moment the requirements are slightly unfocused in scope.
Group should inlude WP leader, Oxford, Nick.
Groups for ‘after lunch’ should be formed according to functional areas.
Check whether ‘marked for deletion’ requirements should be deleted.
Work out comments (mostly regarding non-defined terms in glossary).
Structuring of individual groups - too quick to minute.

Let’s group according to working groups before lunch break, so we save time after lunch break
and can start in small groups without having to re-convene in a large group just for the purpose of splitting up.
Version to work on is the one under Torino meeting, Day 2, D2.2, version 0.3
Save under new name in same directory!
Use track changes.
Before lunch
**Welcome from innovation lab.**
Suggestion to visit innovation center after lunch - showcase and demo time!
Lots of activities in mobile device domainj - as MWC showed again.
Want to move from requirements as soon as possible to real demos.
Dinner tonight in historical place - and this year is an important place - Italy as a
country has its 150 year anniversary.
Dinner is at place were unification of Italy as a country was done.
Lab tour at 13:00 will last about 30 minutes.
Possibly in two groups (probably only groups of 20 persons), in parallel to lunch.

Identity Requirements discusion beginning.
Andrea suggests that where "Webinos Agent" is mentioned, the requirement can be deleted
ID-Polito-19 deleted because developers’ identity is not interesting in phase 1.
Christian: The relevent thing is that the devices can authenticate to each other
Attestation requirements to change to say that Attestation "to be exposed as an API" rather than as a specific feature.

Christian: Reference to use case not sufficient to refine a requirement. Requirements must make sense on their own.
Update "Attestation of the platform" to "Attestation of the Webinos Platform"
Identifiers: Physically existing things have identities. There needs to be a non-exclusive identifier for each physical thing in the system to allow for abstraction of the physical thing. Identifiers are used for addressing purposes or reference purposes. An address contains an identifier or
… and some inherent routing information (e.g. an email address domain name)
Address is required for communication to identifier participants. Webinos entities engaging in communication will have addresses
Address resolution mechanism maps one address to another address at a different level
"Domain" is a dangerous term to use

Is "identity" a useful concept for Webinos?

"Identity" is a globally unique identifier from a particular stakeholder’s perspective, in a certain context…?
Examples: CPU ID / Smart card ID / EK
Privacy requirement on "Identities" : disclosure limited.
Examples of identifiers: There will be identifiers for "all webinos-defined entities"
Artefacts of the webinos project will need identifiers and identifying schemes to be defined. Whereas existing objects should reuse existing identity schemes
Requirement: all new artefacts created by webinos will have identifiers and an identifying mechanism defined. The scope of this identifier must also be defined. Should there be a Webinos namespace + ontology? This seems to make sense.
Thought — Webinos entities explicitly devices, users, need to be identifiable though a shared namespace
IF we have identifiers then these MAY be used for addressing, but there may be some that do not resolve.
An address is bound to a resolution mechanism
An address is an identifier bound to a resolution mechanism
End identity discussion
Normen to write intro sentences.

Policy and Security discussion
Rephrase "PS-DEV-Oxford-78" to avoid word of "example": "description of behavior that would change based on a policy changing"
"May" requirements usually unnecessary unless as a condition from a SHOULD requirement.
PS-ISMB-036 needs to be rephrased.
WE should avoid specifying requirements on applications.
PS-Oxford-46: Modify to state that applications shall receive a message informing the application that the request was denied and MAY be able to deal with this gracefully
TLS requirement needs to at the very least be rephrased. " If secure communications options are available then they should be used by default "
deleted DA-DWP-POLITO-001: Reason: unclear why it is needed to have a one-to-one mapping

Webinos is a web based platform defined by a suite of specifications with a reference open source implementation. The platform is necessary and sufficient to guarantee interoperability between web applications over multiple devices and multiple domains (tv, automotive, etc). Webinos is built upon the state of the art technologies described in Deliverable D02.3 by facilitating an abstraction layer (overlay
network) allowing coordination of web apps across multiple devices in a secure, private, and usable manner. The requirements are structured by the following functional areas: - functional area 1 - ….
Thanks John for minuting in the meantime!

**TODO:** Write one or two sentences about the conclusions of your functional area.
Ajit: Also add any constraints / limitations / recommendations about the functional area.
Please add one or two sentences introducing the functional area.
Change the "use case reference" to say "reference" and have something in each box, even if it just says "Common sense" or "expertise"
Requirements workshop wrap-up
The remaining work is…
 to finish off the workshop work
remove the references in the requirements tables to "architecture"
to produce a conclusion section
to produce an executive summary

**Introduction of task 2.6 by Visionmobile:**
starts in month 6 (now), due in month 10 (June 2011)
Reqs Workshop - It was suggested to replace the column use case reference with just reference to allow more flexibility

besides IPR and governance also reflect the flavour of the platform that is candidate for using could be same or different across domains from the DoW: D02.6) Target Platforms, target Requirements, Platform IPRs, and State of the Art: This deliverable documents the platform selection process for the realizations of webinos in the four domains mobile, PC, automotive
and home media based on the preferences of the consortium partners and the scope of the webinos project.
According to the selected platform this deliverable will also document special requirements to the architectural
design related to the platform selection. This deliverable is associated to task 2.6. [month 10]

Requirements in D2.2 are purely functional. Reqs in D2.6 are based on commercial and legal aspects.
Should 2.6 come up with functional requirements or is this task 3.1?
Need to do due dilligence on choice of platform.
Some aspects might be influenced by security considerations.
For example, can we actually (and with what effort) a policy enforcement point.
Maybe we need to go through candidate platforms tick/ctoss/tick/cross and check features.
Once we have a shortlist of recommended platforms, we can negotiate which we can use
within the legal framework and governance guidelines of webinos.
Consortium partners may have preferences - need to put them on the table and match with requirements.
First level is implementation platform, second is specification platform.
First is more MeeGo vs. Qt, second is more WAC vs. W3C.
Also need to negotiate commercial terms for platform license, once we got our choice.

We need to get the consortium agreement signed first, then we can have a legal unit
to be able to handle legal issues (which can include 3rd parties, which would be difficult
to manage at the moment).
2.6 needs to provide a strong recommendations, but essentially it’s already clear that this
needs to be done.
Actual handling of this will probably handled as part of exploitation.
Maybe need to update task description of 2.6 in DoW and possibly define communication with WP3.

Though the technical platform should be more in influence to WP4.

But we need to make the dependencies and workflow (whether it is 3/4/8.2) clear.
Web API is in WP3, almost all other technical decisions have mainly effect on WP4.
Should also provide two or three slides about this on review, so the reviewers know
what we are doing and where we are heading.
Close for WP2 for today.
Correction
Close full WP2 session for today, work groups continue working.

deleted requirement NM-DWP-ISMB-006 with reason already covered by other requirements
