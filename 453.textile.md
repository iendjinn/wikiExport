Task 3.2 API specifications, phase 1
====================================

{{toc}}

Overview
--------

This task develops application programming interface specifications (APIs) to make the desired functionalities available to webinos applications. In WP4, these APIs are implemented within webinos reference implementations for the four domains mobile, home media, PC, and automotive. The API development works in collaboration with WP8.1 to enable API standardizations, for example in W3C, on the one hand and to make use of existing specifications on the other hand. Here, webinos can influence the standardization process to include the needs of the consortium partners.

Work plan
---------

### API specifications phase 1, task 3.2 process

# Agree on needed APIs based on requirements and architectural platform elements
# Identify and analyze existing APIs (W3C, WAC, proprietary etc) specifications and implementations
# Find gaps towards existing APIs / state high level requirements on new APIs
# Specification of proposals for :
- Modifications/extensions to existing APIs where needed
- New APIs when needed
# Work with WP8 to fill gaps with relevant organizations
# Reconcile with Architecture
# Complete API specifications

WP3.2 runs in parallell with WP3.1 System Architecure Specification. This is a problem as we canâ€™t specify all APIs until we have defined the Webinos architecture. To tackle this the following approach is suggested:

1.  WP 3.2 starts analyzing needed APIs based on Webinos requirements from WP2.2, identifying existing APIs from standards and implementations and identifying gaps.
2.  WP 3.1 identifies and creates new APIs we need based on architecture defined in WP 3.1.

### API specifications phase 2, task 3.4 process

See "Task 3.4 wiki": http://dev.webinos.org/redmine/projects/t3-4/wiki.

API Categories
--------------

The analysis of Webinos APIs is done in the pages below. For each required API existing APIs that may fulfill the Webinos requirement are investigated. Gaps are documented. If there is no existing APIs fulfilling the required functionality high level requirements on the required API is stated.

-   [[HW Resource APIs]]: APIs for access to HW related resources in userâ€™s device, in another device or in the cloud.
-   [[Application Data APIs]]: APIs for access to application data in userâ€™s device, in another device or in the cloud.
-   [[Communication APIs]]: APIs for communication with other devices, other applications and servers.
-   [[Application execution APIs]]: APIs allowing webinos application to launch other applications.
-   [[Discovery APIs]]: APIs for device, service and application discovery
-   [[Security and Privacy APIs]]: APIs for access to privacy and security related settings
-   [[User and application data APIs]]: APIs for access to user profile and installed application related information
