Secure Elements API
===================

This is an API for accessing functions on contact or contactless smart cards or similar devices using the Application Protocol Data Unit (APDU) command response protocol, as defined by ISO 7816-4. In essence, the command consists of a 4 byte header followed by up to 255 bytes of data. The response contains a 2 byte header followed by up to 256 bytes of data. The headers and data are specified in a suite of standards from ISO and others. It also possible to develop custom secure elements using Java cards from companies such as G&D and Gemalto.

The aim is to give system applications written in JavaScript, and executing on a web run-time, a lightweight means to send commands to secure elements and handle the responses using byte arrays (similar to the existing Java API). Applications would have access to the crypto APIs being developed in the W3C Web Crypto WG.

A brief introduction to APDU can be found at:

The Java APDU API is described at:

Implementation
--------------

There are two main hardware options:

-   USB smart card reader for contact based cards
-   NFC based reader for contactless cards

Java Smart Card development kits are available, and this would involve interfacing Node with Java. The open source cross platform NFC library **libnfc** can be used to access smart cards over NFC, but involves a lot of low level details. For Linux, **PC/SC**, **OpenSC** and **IFD** provide a convenient open source framework together with **libnfc** and **Node.js**. A further idea is to use the Java SmartCard API on Android, see:

-   "Secure Element Evaluation Kit for the Android platform":http://code.google.com/p/seek-for-android/wiki/UsingSmartCardAPI

It appears that the Nexus S should work with that for UICC smart card development, however, this involves reflashing the phone. Moreover, the above page states that the minimum required SDK is API15 (Android 4.03) which is yet to be supported for the webinos Android build. However, it seems promising as a basis for demo purposes. We would also need some sample smart cards with some interesting applets on them, although we could in principle develop our own applets.

Examples
--------

_**Should code examples aim to be complete, or should they strive to present the idea simply?**_

The first step is to obtain a list of available APDU terminals:

<pre class="javascript prettyprint>
 Webinos.apdu.requestTerminals(listener, success, fail);

function fail (why)
 {
 console.log("Couldn’t get list of APDU terminals: " + why);
 }

function listen (terminals)
 {
 for (var i = 0; i < terminals.length; +*i)
 {
 var terminal = terminals[i];
 console.log("found APDU terminal: "* terminal.name);
 }
 }
</pre>

Having picked a terminal and established that a card is present, you can now connect to the card:

<pre class="javascript prettyprint>
 terminal.connect(success, fail);

function success ()
 {
 console.log("connected to card");
 }

// connect operation will fail if card isn’t present
 function fail (why)
 {
 console.log("couldn’t connect to card: " + why);
 }
</pre>

Once connected you can format a command, send it to the card, and process the response:

<pre class="javascript prettyprint>
 var command = terminal.createCommand();

// initialize header bytes
 command.setHeaders(cla, ins, p1, p2);

// set payload from byte array
 command.setPayload(payload);

// and send it to the card
 terminal.transmit(command, success, fail);

// handle the response
 function success (response)
 {
 console.log("response status: " + to_hex(response.status) +
 " with " + response.payload.length + " bytes of data");

// when done, disconnect
 terminal.disconnect();
 }

// called if transmit failed
 function fail (why)
 {
 console.log("couldn’t transmit command to card: " + why);
 }
</pre>

The terminal status _present_ property indicates whether a card is present, and you can also set handlers for call backs when the card is inserted or removed.

/*
 You first need to find which terminals are available.
 Having found a suitable terminal, you can then test
 if a card is present, and connect to it, and then
 transmit a command and process the response, before
