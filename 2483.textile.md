UI-Widget: Split View
=====================

A split view is an application screen which is divided in two logical elements. Most split screens have a menu on the left screen and content related to the selected menu item on the (larger) right screen. To give a better view, a mock-up of this type of interface can be seen below.

### Rendering rules

Assuming the developer doesn’t use fixed-widths for the main navigation elements so they expand or shrink along with the screen size, this view is good for most screens. The most notable exception to this, are smartphones. An overview of platform-specific rendering rules can be found below.

#### PC and Tablet

Next to smartphones, PC’s and tablets are the most used computing devices that offer an easy interaction method and decent screen sizes. A split view is used in a significant number of applications on these devices, so it is very likely the developer was designing for these platforms when creating the interface. So no significant generic adaptations can be made for these platforms.

#### Smartphone

Smartphones are the notable exception for this widget type. Their screen is usually too small to contain the menu from the left-hand side and the content from the right-hand side on-screen at the same time. The generic adaptation that can be used works in the following matter:
* On start-up of the application (screen), the right-hand side with the content is hidden by letting the menu take up the entire screen so the user can easily make their selection.
* When an item is selected, the menu is shifted to the left out of view, so the content is shown. Filling the content element with the correct content should be taken care of by the application.
* When the user presses the back button, the menu is shifted into view from the left and covers the content area again, so the user can make a new selection.

#### In-vehicle system and TV

The main restriction for this type of widget on these systems, is the interaction method. When the screen is shown, focus should be placed on the first menu element automatically. When the user is scrolling (down), focus should not be moved out of the menu, but remain on the menu items until the user has made a selection. After that has happened, the focus is shifted to the content area, until the user presses the back button.

### Code example

The following exemplifies how to annotate the HTML code of the application in order to allow the UI adaption for list views.

<pre>
<code class="HTML">
<div data-role="splitview">
 <div data-role="split-left">
 <ul data-role=‘listview’>
 <li> … </li>
 <li> … </li>
 <li> … </li>
 <li> … </li>
 <li> … </li>
 <ul>
 </div>
 <div data-role="split-right">
 </div>
</div>
</code>
</pre>
