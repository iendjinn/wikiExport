===========================

<div class="uml">

title Scenario 2nGeorge wants to view his mobile hosted MP4s on his set-top-boxnand neither of the devices have access to the internet

actor George
participant "George’s mobile" as George_mobile
participant "George’s set-top-box" as George_set_top_box

autonumber

note over George, George_set_top_box #FF6666 : this scenario differs from scenario 1 in note before step 7

 identification 

group identification example
 George -> George_mobile : switch on
 George_mobile -> George : ask the pin
 George -> George_mobile : provide the pin
end

 device discovery 

group device discovery example
 note over George, George_mobile : the user may set a policy to automaticallynstart device discovery
 George --> George_mobile : <font color="gray"><i>start device discovery</i></font>
 George_mobile -> George_set_top_box : broadcast hello message
 George_set_top_box -> George_mobile: hello response
end

 personal local cloud join 

note over George_mobile, George : the user may set a policy to automaticallynselect devices to autenticate and join.ntree possible solutions are:n- try to authenticate every sensed devicen- maintain a local membership listn- maintain a local copy of a remoten membership list
George_mobile --> George : <font color="gray">show available clouds and devices</font>
George--> George_mobile : <font color="gray">select the set-top-box</font>
George_mobile -> George_set_top_box : George’s mobile authentication
George_set_top_box -> George_mobile : George’s set-top-box authentication

note over George_mobile, George_set_top_box : personal cloud devices can use their shared secret tondistribute session keys and establish secure channels
George_mobile -> George_set_top_box : establish a secure channel

 service provision 

George -> George_mobile : ask for MP4 list
George_mobile -> George_set_top_box : MP4 list retrieval
George_set_top_box -> George_mobile : MP4 list transmission
George_mobile -> George : MP4 list display
George -> George_mobile : MP4 selection
George_mobile -> George_set_top_box : MP4 retrieval
George_set_top_box -> George_mobile : MP4 transmission
George_mobile -> George : MP4 consumption

How to select devices to authenticate?

a) like in scenario 1

b) like in scenario 1

c) maintaining a personal cloud membership remote list (e.g. on WAP)
 c.1. George’s mobile gets the personal cloud membership list from the local cache
 c.2. George’s mobile tries to authenticate devices of the personal cloud membership list

d) _extension of C)_: primary device of the user runs a backup service which provides all the features of online entities
 d.1. George’s mobile cannot reach the online entity which stores the cloud membership remote list (e.g. the WAP)
 d.2. George’s mobile starts discovering other devices belonging to George’s cloud which might be reachable on the network (in contrast to the WAP)
 d.3a. if any of the reachable devices of George’s cloud runs a baackup service, George’s mobile retrieves the list from there
 d.3b. if none of George’s other devices is reachable or if none of them runs a backup service, George’s mobile uses its own cached list of devices and starts running the backup service for any other device which may join later
 *Note*: d) is more complex than c) but it has two advantages: (1) behaviour of devices in the online and offline case are almost the same, (2) cached lists can be synchronised with the other devices in the cloud more easily
