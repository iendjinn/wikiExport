Draft Reference Architecture
============================

Basic "State of the Art" Web Runtime Architecture
---------------------------------------------------

![](Webinos_Draft_Architecture.png)

The base reference architecture comes in five functional layers

### Packaging

Mechanisms for packaging, describing and â€œanchoringâ€ a web application

### UI and Code Logic

Standard web languages for creating interfaces, writing programming logic. Essentially HTML + Javascript

### Communications

Mechanism for the web application communicating with the outside layer. Can be subdivided on the base architecture into two types

**Declarative:** HMTL links to external resources that are pulled over HTTP according to the page interpretation and display semantics
**Programtic:** Methods of invoking a connection programatically and asynchronously. Essentially XHR, xmlhttprequest. Will include websockets.

### Policy and Security

The layer that is responsible of for interpreting and policing security. Could include security settings like cookies, popups etc. But most relevant for accessing new extension APIs

### Extension APIs

New APIs taht provide functionality to a web application which is outside of the normal security concerns and sandbox of a typical web application.

Primary Webinos Innovation
--------------------------

### Problem

XHR, the normal mode of communication between client and server, works well for traditional web. Webinos introduces notion of peer applications, that are all both clients and servers, where the programming logic can be even more highly distributed. This introduces problems of
* How do â€œwebinosâ€ applications find each other
* How can they communicate effectively
* How is policy enforced over a distrusted model

### Solution

We introduce concept of Webinos Agents that will act as proxies for devices/people/application, to address two issues
* Discoverability over complex networks
* Distributed policy enforcement

We introduce the concept of JavaScript bridges, to simplify programming tasks for webinos developers

Webinos Architecture
--------------------

### Webinos Masters and Slaves

A webinos runtime is capable of interpreting and executing a webinos application. The application may be hosted or packaged, It consists of HTML and Javascript resources, can make use of webinos recognised APIs and is moderated by the webinos security policy.

Webinos runtime can locally execute webinos applications

A webinos slave is discoverable and, addressable by a webinos runtime. A webinos slave has capabilities that can be queried and executed remotely by a webinos runtime by JavaScript bindings to these capabilities. The discovery, addressability, over execution and policy enforcement is provided in a distributed fashion by the webinos network.

Some examples of masters and slaves to be found below

### The Webinos Network Problem

One of the challenges for webinos to to deliver its distributed vision across a number of different network types.

Although these come in many flavours, two of the more extreme use cases that eptimise the problem are

1.  connection between a mobile phone and a laptop, which are both on a public internet
2.  connection between a mobile phone and an incar device (in a tunnel) which only have a local wireless network connection to each other and not public internet access.

### Webinos Networks

To help solve this problem we introduce the concept of a webinos network.

A webinos network is an overlay network, which is independent of the underlying bearer. It has its own addressing mechanisms, concept of long lasting sessions, and inbuilt distributed security an policy based upon strong and trusted credentials

More fully:

-   Should have its own virtualised addressing schema to identify (devices, apps, users) irrespective of the physical bearer/system
-   Should have its own virtualised messaging mechanism - that will use all the possible physical networks
    -   This messaging mechanism could be highly optimised â€“ multiplexing etc
-   It will be able to operate in the public internet and local internet scenarios
-   This network should support the concept of â€œlong lasting sessionsâ€, addressability and messaging mechanism persist even though network has been torn down and another created â€“ and or and application moves between devices
-   As part of the session setup from an â€œend pointâ€ â€“ full and complete credentials are passed (ie user/device/application/runtime) securely. We can see this as 1st order context passed to the system. That allows for adaptation
-   This network facilitates the discovery and execution of remote services and capability â€“ allowing many apps/devices to co-ordinate.
-   The networks communication mechanism - should be symmetric
-   This network as Security and Policy - built into the network - to facilitate distribute enforcement

### Webinos Agents

Is an key implementation ingredient of the Webinos Network. This agent provides the distributed intelligence to route, store and police the webinos network traffic.

### Webinos JavaScript Proxy

Is the mechanism via with remote capability and service is exposed to a 3rd party webinos application developer.

This mechanism allows the implementation details to be totally hidden from the developer, but exposes the functionality in a manner that is easy for the user to understand and use

Glossary
--------

#### Web Application

An application developed in HTML and Javascript, and runs outside the chrome (ie has full control of its user interface)
Delivers features and functions outside of the typical capability of sandboxed website.

#### Interpreted Web Application

A typical web application where the code and markup is interpreted at runtime.

#### Compiled Web Application

A web application that has been "pre-processed" so that the markup and script delivered to the device on which it will run is not the normal form. Includes

-   Phonegap: where code is complied to native
-   Opera mini: where web code is complied to a proprietary binary format.

#### Hosted (Web) App

A web application that is left on a web server and is download from there each time it is executed.
Will probably also require a manifest.

#### Packaged (Web) App

A web application packaged (usually as a zip file) and can be copied from device to device and executed

#### Web manifest

A piece of meta data that describes the web application. Needed for security and UI purposed, Includes

-   config.xml from normal w3c widgets
-   descriptor file form a google chrome .crx file
-   apple web clips format
-   HTML5 ApplicationCache manifest

#### Webinos Runtime (webinos master)

A webinos runtime is capable of interpreting and executing a webinos application. The application may be hosted or packaged, It consists of HTML and Javascript resources, can make use of webinos recognised APIs and is moderated by the webinos security policy.

Webinos runtime can locally execute webinos applications

#### Webinos Slave

A webinos slave is discoverable and, addressable by a webinos runtime. A webinos slave has capabilities that can be queried and executed remotely by a webinos runtime by JavaScript bindings to these capabilities. The discovery, addressability, over execution and policy enforcement is provided in a distributed fashion by the webinos network.

#### Open Addressable Internet

The scenario where two devices have TCP access to each other and are discoverable over public DNS systems

#### Open Addressable Internet

The scenario where two devices have TCP access to each other and are discoverable over public DNS systems

#### Local Internet

The scenario where two devices have TCP access but do not have visibility of general internet - nor access to public DNS system
TODO: these definitions need exploring better; probably worth looking to definitions used for DLNA

#### Webinos Network

Webinos network is an overlay network, independent of the physical network, with its own notions of addressing, session and security. It is capable of passing information in an optimsed manner

#### Webinos Agent

Is an key implementation ingredient of the Webinos Network. This agent provides the distributed intelligence to route, store and police the webinos network traffic.

#### Webinos Javascript Proxy

Is the mechanism via with remote capability and service is exposed to a 3rd party webinos application developer.
