Minutes, Wednesday, 23rd February 2011
========================================

basically only 3 months left for composing specification in WP3.1 (first month passed already, last month reserved for finalizing deliverable)

WP3 Specification
**Task 3.1 System specifications**
----------------------------------

Have to be implementable
WP3.5 is essentially split into two phases: creating the deliverable for D03.5 (end of June) and then a second phase ending with a deliverable in D03.6. Large "quiet" gap between the two.
WP3.2 is about JavaScript APIs on the device, WP3.1 is about anything else that is not WP3.2 or WP3.5 (security)
There are 15 specification areas
one or two companies working on each
Should not need to start from scratch - just develop from state of the art
Issues for today:
Need a standard template for APIs - consistent naming scheme, avoid confusion caused by (e.g.) asychronous vs synchronous APIs.
1) Description of the Area
2) Location in Architecture
3) Relation to other Elements
——
Available Specs
effort for webinos additions (improving state of the art)
Issues for tomorrow
1) Work planning
2) issue tracking
Nick Allot: We need to have a guess at what the probable deliverable looks like
The deliverable could contain new protocols, interfaces and data formats
Specification Area Presentations
**#1 User Identity Management**
Devices in the "webinos cloud" can identify each other and "belong" to a user
"Clouds" can overlap
4 classes of identification
Own webinos cloud, connected webinos clouds, Certain third parties, Any Other Entitiy
Believe an identity provider is required
this provides single sign on (SSO)
Mobile phone can be autheticated via SIM/UICC auth token
Not everyone has a mobile phone
User identity has a close relationship with Device discovery

Issues:
User data management, Device discovery, overlay network architecture, Security and Privacy
DaveR - It would be interesting to look at some other technologies (zero knowledge proofs) and have a discussion on those technologies
NickAllot - Is zero knowledge prrofs part of the partial identity provider - DaveR - it can be seen this way
NickAllot - Any thoughts on description of identity?
Christian S - There are ways, It maybe possible to discuss something specific for webinos
Discussion on Identities - There are several ways of approaching the problem - basically a) build on existing technology or b) create something best in breed
W3C are in the process of setting up a workshop on Identity Management in a few months time
—————————-
#2
**#2 User Data Management**
In scope work:
Identification of relevant data
Access to data
Creating and Sharing data
Synchronisation
Local/Remote storage
Deletion of personal data
Managment of user prefs
Inetgrity of Data Management
Needed Components:
Access - maybe driven by 3.2
Storage - provided by a Data Storage manager (connections to device discovery)
Sync Capability - Includes tasks like scheduling; Can exisiting technologies be used? (this block could be quite significant)
Template for user prefs across devices -Reuse of existing state of the Art? Where is the data hosted and how is it accessed?
Issues: Where is the data hosted? Cloud? offline copies? part of W-Agent?
Does webinos enable protection?
Will there be pre-specified meta data template- Out of scope?
Should we push more consistent API across devices
Nick Allot: State of the art - W3C user data API + BONDI gallery - What else is needed to add to these?
Is sync infrastructure or an application?
There is no universal inter-operable method to set what can and cannot be shared

Dave R: Where does the data that answers "who can access my devices?" go?
Close link between policy, identity, user data management.
AJit J: The problem is so vast we need to decide to tackle something first
UDM Note: Policy and Security requirements state that policies can be attached to data marked as "personal" data…
—————————-
**#3 Policy Managament**
Required/Provided information
1st part a request element
2nd element - a Policy repository
3rd element Context
4th Element - Responses
5 Architectural blocks proposed
Issues:
Where are the proposed architectural components located?
Support for local configurable policies - how to sync?
Coffee Break
Ad hoc demo Zero Knowledge Proofs
 A way to verify claims without providing additional information.
Classical example: Showing that a users age is above a certain
number without providing any indication on the identity of
the user.
Also to show that the user lives at a certain place or belongs to a specific
group (like being a current student at a specific university).

Example based on Java and Browser extension.
Browser extension communicates with user credential on USB stick,

Java handles communication with backend server.

Back to Specification presentations
**#4 Device Discovery**

A mechanism that allows devices to be connected seamlessly, whether they are locally or remotely available
"Technology independent but not technology agnostic"
Tightly coupled with application and sevrice discovery
local discovery: Zeroconf (Apple Bonjour), UPnP (DNLA) and DPWS (Standard by Oasis)
Remote Discovery - possibly through a remote discovery proxy - problem is how to address devices with no public IP
Local Discovery: Plan to reuse existing (one or more) standards and extend
There are privacy and discovery concerns
How to overcome addressing problems - IPv6 or XMPP, what about non webinos enabled devices?
We need to make it work with the underlying platform, and inter-operable with application/service disocvery
Dave R: How long would it take to extend webkit to cope with something like Bonjour? - Safari has Bonjour disocvery built in
There was a discussion on how to handle device ID, User ID, Application ID - there was a suggestion that employing a similar schema for all was a good idea
——————-
**#5 Application and Service Discovery**
The work area is about discovering applications and services independently of where they are hosted
What is a service? An APi to get temperature from sensor, A web API, or e.g. a remote control API
When a new service is detected - the application should be able to download new software resources to be able to use the service
There are several exisitng standards in the area of service disocvery
Nick A: Do we strongly distinguish an app and a service? Answer yes: Access to sensors and web sevrices in the cloud are services
Hans M: In bluetooth is is possible to add new services - will there be a be way to add new applications and services? This is probably a direction that will be taken
Nick A: Described the problem as a code packaging issue - this would be such that an application can publish that it offfers a service
Fabio R: cf. with Android which has "intents" - this would allow the application to have the services within it
This will be a subject revisited and discussed in future
——————————
**#6 Widget Handling**
Can be divided into 2 tasks - Lifecycle and user interaction, Look and feel
W3C - widget packaging specification
For packaging widgets, webinos could use the W3C P&C spec with some extensions to cover some meta datas
Widget handling - needs to be able to handle life cycle and execution remotely
WAC specification has a large overlap with the webinos requirements
Hand M: In the deliverable 2.1 there is no mention of widgets but it does manage applications - why?
Stephan S: What is the difference between a Widget and application?
Dave R: reccomendation to look at the W3C specification on web app caching
Discussion on Apps vs Widgets - There appears to be a need to clarify the terminology and the scope of webinos in this area
Hans M: Suggestion to use the term application rather than widget as its more over-arching and therfore neutral
Phillip H: If webinos partners interested in getting widget speficiation stable there is room for help in W3C so talk to him
————————-
**#7 Priveledged Applications**
A privledged app is one that can over-ride system controls and check for specific uID’s
Priveledges are enforced at kernel level
Authorisation is done at the user level
Privledge monitoring will monitor priveldge app activity (those that would fail under user level)
Existing Standards: ActiveX Controls, OCAP
What needs definition: Policies, App Groups, Messages, Access Tokens, Licensing
Nick A: guessing we dont have any use cases - In the web space this will be important (Nokia, and BONDI) - there are several domains where this becomes very important (e.g. Car EMS and Media Conditional Access)
It was felt that this area is a key part of the architecture
————————
**#8 - Analytics**
Application Analytics, Web Analytics, Network Analytics, AppStore Analytics
High level issues for Analytics
Device side client and SDK - how to capture and cache
High level issues: These include caching, battery life, client inteeligence, bandwidth, pushing and pulling info and security
There are industry efforts in the Analytics area (like Google) - It is not currently known if there are any standards in this area
Why Analytics? - There is a lot of interest in this area - There is value in the analysis & reporting
A major pain of analytics solutions is lack of visibility across the user/data journey
The focus is likely to be more on the device side and the transport and less on the srever side
————————
**#8 - Analytics (Part 2)**
Context is any information that can be used to characterize the situation of entity
Need to do: Identify tasks which provide context awareness, Identify entities that create context, Develop context structures, Identify and devlop API’s
Exisiting Work: RDF, RDFa, OWL etc
Also FOAF, XFM, ActivityStrea.ms and GraphDB
Example of twitter creating social relationships between users
The same can be done for webinos
Lunch

**Policy, Rights and Security**
Main message: cross cutting concern, covers many of the areas already discussed
Some areas more significant: ID management, privileged apps, policy
Event Handling
Manage online and offline behaviour, local/global connectivity, store and forward
Battery is more of an implementation issur - message clustering added later
"Don’t reinvent the wheel"
Suggest use XMPP
Looked at SIP and XMPP, Dave suggest to look at Web Sockets too.
Web Sockets implemented in the browser but not necessarily in the runtime
XMPP federated in nature: important for the webinos cloud / network / infrastructure
There are extensions to XMPP: e.g. Serverless messaging. Webinos might introduce webinos extentions to XMPP

erver, when a client loses connectivity need store-forward. XMPP natively supports this.
Second scenario: no connection to a webinos network at all, need to be able to do ad-hoc connection
All scenarios supported by XMPP, hence the suggestion
Comment from Dave (W3C): draw attention to W3C Web Events working group
W3C Web Notifications
Hans: Are you suggesting that we require XMPP? Answer: we are now in the phase of the project where we are looking at state of the art technology to use. Requirements to satisfy make it seem like XMPP is suitable.
Hans: Suggest we should just support (rather than require) XMPP.
Answer: We want to avoid re-inventing the wheel, e.g. addressing, federation, store and forward
Google is one of the big users of XMPP, it is open source. Just a suggestion, but we do propose it.
Suggestion: Web Sockets should be investigated.
Answer: does Web Sockets actually help with messaging to other webinos devices?
Comment: Real time communications group is looking at peer-to-peer communication too.
Take away: Look at Web events, web sockets, and make a more detailed comparison and decide on the main messaging technology
George: What about a publish/subscribe mechanism for messaging in general? XMPP Has good scalability features?
Plugins and Extension handling
Pugins help the browser perform specific functions: extensions to existing browsers
In Webinos, ensures Webinos can incorporate non-webinos components
Mechanism to manage non-webinos client side software components
Avoid opening up the door with plugins: security issues
How do we handle plugins on the device to avoid this: plugin manager on client. To list, uninstall, verify integrity
Plugin directory: counterpart. Provides information for client devices.
How do we guarantee compatibility?
How do we ensure that plugins do not interfere with the operating system?
Can anyone install any plugins? Should we sandbox them? Trusted plugins?
Links to: Privacy,rights,security & policy mgmt & privileged applications
Standards: Netscape Plugin API. Supported by all browsers except IE (ActiveX)
Standards: PEPPER platform as extensions to NPAPI
Google NaCl for sandboxing
Next steps: find interested partners to work on this
Evaluate current solutions
Match solutions to requirements
Write the specification
(links about the previous topic about Notifications and Messaging: http://www.w3.org/2010/webevents/, http://www.w3.org/2010/web-notifications/ )
Slides available on Redmine
Device Messaging?
Overlay network?
Overlay Netowrk
Problems for developers due to complexity of sharing data across different messaging systems.
Direct Comms possibel where devices share a technology
Aim to reduce effort for developers to write applications and to add tolerance for change
Address scheme useful for metadata and describing context
Could use URIs
Could use objects in javascript. Call methods on objects
Points on discovery. How does the overlay network handle discovery?
Could have webinos components that aggregate data. Similar role to social networks?
Could use zero conf (UPnP, SSDP, or DNS based e.g. Bonjour type)
Compass API. Application developer wants a compass and doesn’t care where specifically the compass is. Could use a local broker to query, multicast, or query a cloud service.
How are changes in context exposed to applications? Want to avod mixing up abstraction layers, not hooking into low-level events
Overlay netowrk uses a pluggable component
Trust models different on different layers
Overlay network layer needs to map to actual security models (credentials, etc) and even automatic configuration of this
May involve a policy language
Social networks provide inspiration for how to specify "my friend Jane can access my TV…" very different to underlying mechanisms
Messaging models: clean encapsulations.
Some people use Javascript libraries such as JQuery
How does the eventing system work?
Sometimes simple callbacks are enough.
Synchronous vs Asynchronous. Sync very powerful, but can be difficult for developers: might have an asychronous back-end exposing a "synchronous" front end for the developer. Hide the details.
Networking layer not a monolithic thing, but something that third parties can plug into
Cloud services
What services do we need in the webinos cloud to make it all work?
Looked at 2.7 Context of use
Core services: security, discovery, persistence, …
Main action item: decide how to proceed with this area considering overlap with many others
Propose to be cross-cutting, taking care of the interoperability issues between groups?
Propose a more collaborative approach to create communication between groups.
… make it the responsibility of the specific groups to be interoperable with each other … ?
Action: Discuss this point on how to proceed with this area and interoperability.
Are we looking at the functional or non-functional requirements?
What do we do with performance? Are we making requirements on this part, or check after?
Comment: we don’t need to worry explicitly about it in the project, more important for commercial solutions
(I’m not sure I’m doing justice to this discussion: needs more detail)
Should we take a collaborative approach
Might collaborate with Security. Similar: cross cutting concern
Action: Need to follow up on this issue

**Proposing tools for Work package 3**
One objective of this area is to propose some common standards
What are the problems that tools can help solve?
Are we entirely satisfied with using a wiki for creating the architecture? Should we use some other format: DocBook, etc.
Propose DocBook as a more usable alternative?
Can all the partners contribute to the architecture easily? Wiki has the advantage of only requiring a browser. Word will be problematic for some partners
What format for diagrams, images? Do we stick with UML2? Use other formats?
How do we share, contribute and edit these things?
Standards for APIs, protocols, etc.
Which formats: extract API description from the architecture automatically ? Do we want tools to help with this?
Example of tools: xml editors.
Need decent xml editor tools. Uml drawing tools. (PlantUML? XMI?)
Do we need scripts / converters / tools? Bugtracking system?
Issue tracking in the wiki: is it sufficient?
Propose PlantUML and WebIDL and wiki
Propose passing around artefacts in XML
Nick: On the WebIDL front: seems to work very well
Comment: we need a pool of resources. Not fair to put on one company. Need to be "fixing our own pain".
Practical things would help: making something that would be easy to edit wiki pages offline, import and export from Word
Two options on WebIDL: Can put thoughts in the wiki itself. Or can put the files raw on the SVN/CVS and then use offline tools for producing final documentation
Propose: call around for opinions. Mostly personal preference.
End of 3.1 discussion
3.2 Discussion
API’s for web application developers
API Categories
1) HW related resources in the users device or another device in the cloud
2) Application Data
3) Communication - Data sync, Messaging, Server-push etc
4) Application Exceution - event triggering, time based triggering
5) Discovery
6) Access to Security and Privacy Data
7) Access to user/application data
Nick A: Discovery and Access was discussed in 3.1 - does this fall into 3.1 or 3.2 if it includes API development
This is an importnat co-ordination issue
API’s Status
(Note: Security and Privacy might be discussed in 3.2 as well as 3.1: 3.5 needs to collaborate with both)
Soem APi’s are already in modern browsers and being worked on elsewhere e.g W3C
sp Soem/Some
API Landscape: W3C Web Applications WG - Many API’s (in different states of development)
W3C Geolocation WG - in prgoress and in implementation
W3C Device API (and Policy) WG - Several API’s proposal to remove policy from this working group
W3C RTC-Web - workgroup starting up
WHAT WG - DeviceElement and ConnectionPeer interface
WAC 1.0 - based on JIL API’s based on Javascript
WAC Waikiki - based on BONDI, JIL, W3C
Nokia Symbian WRT
Phonegap - wrapping webapps into platform specific containers
Web Introducer - Enables web apps to discover services
Types of API:
Javascript
HTML elements
(HTML elements is a simple solution)
DOM events
REST API’s
Process:-
Agree on Process
Identify API’s
GAp ANalysis
Create a table on the wiki, identify gaps - use this as a source for deicisons
Where no exisitng high level API’s are available could list requirements
Q on whether to support just one API in each category - no reason to do more if something suits
Work to fill gaps with relevant organisations
Target is to have a complete set oF API specifications

Timeline - March 1 2011 - June 30 2011
March 11 - All partners agree on required API’s - allocate editors
May 2 F2F Meeting
June 6 - F2F Meeting Final API review
June 30 Publish API specifications
Need to have plan for WP3 to present at review meeting
WP8 overlap: how we review specifications?
The most urgent thing is to identify the API’s we need
Then we compare this with the work going on in W3C
Hans: Suggesting regarding timing…? (inaudible)
Comment (Nick): Shouldn’t be overreaching. The breadth of APIs is not too important compared to fundamental architecture.
Comment (Nick): APIs are sometimes - worryingly - developed by people who don’t actually use them.
We might need to relook at W3C or WAC API’s
We may need to reconsider some of the existing standards as Webinos is more distributed
Comment (Nick): Much rather have a javascript API than a REST API. REST not good for sycnchronous, and developers wrap with Javascript anyway
How do we get lessons from previous APIs into Webinos@?
What is the base for the implementation? Which existing standard / technology?
Answer: we won’t know until WP4 / WP2.6, and may be based on multiple implementations.
Connection with 3.1 / 3.2: tasks should be integrated?
Concern that some partners are in only one half of 3.1/3.2
Discussion over how 3.1 and 3.2 differ, and on where specification stops and implementation begins.
May need some javascript stubbing exercise as part of the API specification process.
… to make sure that reasonable client side code is written.
This is to "sanity check" the API’s
Note: we have missed out potentially innovative PVR APIs.
General point: must check with all domains when doing API specification, other tasks.
Stephan: Separation of resource does not imply separation of work activities: we can do work activities in any manner that makes sense.
We have intial resources from the DoW - we need to have an activitiy breakdown
Challenges - Only 4 months so short timeframe - how do we cope with new technology?
Nick A: One more idea for thought - pick 2 device API’s think of that in a context of domain sharing - but focus on some of the core innovations - e.g local netork, policy privacy etc
COFFEE BREAK

**3.5 Session**
Security Architecture
D03.5 - Febraury - June 2011 (5 months elapsed) 17.5 Person months
Goal: Security framework how we access device capabilities and integrating cloud services
Based on BONDI model, Advanced Trusted Environment and W3C
Separation of work data and private data
Durable models which work on many platforms, Robustness to DDoS attacks, Simple Architecture
Key Challenges:
Manage security as a cross cutting concern, interaction with 3.1 and 2.8
Identifying key architectural components - and how to structure the work effort on them

Anti Goals - Avoid: "security? thats a 3.5 problem", Security as an after-thought, good designs and implementations, good technology but poor usability, creating a trusted but insecure environment

**Plan:**
Identify effort and "areas of concern", Intial meeting / Telephone conference
Joint ownership of 3.1 areas - Privacy rights & security, Identity, Policy Management, Priviledged applications
Establish a secuity and privacy questions list
Expected groups:
Policy Infrastructure needs a mechanism for enforcing
Authentication needs a storng solution
sp storng/strong
Browser based threats e.g. XSS
Details:
1) Policy Infrastucture: Manage access control between users, Synchronisation between a users devices
Privleged applications
2) Secure Execution: Threat from malicious applications, so would be nice to isolate them
Different device have different cpabilities in this area
3) Authentication, Authorisation and Identity
4) Secure Storage
5) Browswer based threats
6) Cloud security models: Pick some examples - OAUTH, Social networking
The format of the deliverable will depend on 3.1 to an extent
Guiodance on how applications should be structured
sp Guiodance/Guidance
Kick off with an informal chat, Regular conference calls, Allocate key areas to watch

Security Perspectives
"Trusted web applications considered harmful" - title of blog by Robin Berjon
Application developers can gain some respite through the use of thourougly tested security libraries
Blind trust is scary!

Firefox extensions run with elevated privledges
Signing an app helps
Better sandboxes - can they be defined
Adding features safely within distributed code security boundary
"Todays practices on the Web are truly awful"
Users tend to use the smae password on many sites
and tend to make them easy to remember
Can be improved by avoiding the need for users to type in credentials
Certificates have many issues, out of date etc
Sending userId and password in the clear
Firechief extension
Strong Credentials
Polito contribution…
Root of trust - OpenTC and Tclouds projects - Analysis of the missing ring in the chain, how importnat they are how wide they are
Secure channels (IPSec, TLS), secure naming and discovery
BMW interests….
Secure interface for vehicles system, Access control
Key threats - high jacking of vehicle system, messing around with the vehicle system
NTT Docomo eurlabs interests…
Contribution areas: everything related to identification, authorisation as far as this involves IDM
Key Threats: Secure integration of identity provider, Secure integration of webinos Agents, Set-up secure communication channels between devices
Samsung….
Interests around device discovery security
Impleo….
Securing network access
Policy Management: Its important to make it "democratic" - it would be a bad thing to lock to one policy supplier
Strong enterprise uses cases - lock and wipe scenarios, enetrprise features
Separation of work and life very important
Telecom Italia…
Policy interests from user perspective, and improvements and enhancements from BONDI and WAC side

Todays agenda completed

Stephan presenting Admin related stuff
Active work packages so far not only 2, but also 7 and 8.
So far we have not really reported resources use, but we will have
to report the PM spent on a per task base for the 12 month review.
We need all partners to fill out a time reporting for the first 6 months and planned effort for M7-M12
And we need to collect the data already in the first step after month 6.
Steffi Keller did send out an Excel sheet to collect this data.
Currently the form of presention to the commission is up to us.
(for the review presentation)

Don’t confuse financial auditing with resource presentation on review.
Q:How to account for meetings like this, which are multi-task.
A: Use some reason - it’s relatively little amount compared to the
total numbers and overdoing the details are not worth the effort.
Just try to stay in the same WP if possible.
Nick: Use common sense. Install the ethos that the person responsible
for a deliverable gets the authority to direct effort spending.
Switch to presentation of redmine for WP3 effort tracking.
Strong insistance by TNO that this is not a useful tool for the task.
Effort needs to be filled by management to make formal sense,
people filling in individual efforts will not add up to useful numbers.
Ambiesense: Reported effort does not really help in determining
the status of an individual task.
Does also not fit with W3C internal time tracking.
W3C and TNO use their own internal digital reporting system.
Visionmobile: If not absolutely neccessary, keep current level of granularity
regarding to time and level.
NTUA/TNO - the average cost takes all levels of employees in all WPs into
account - might not match with individual WP accounting.
Suggestion: Put in current Excel type reporting into redmine - same
level of reporting - per task and per month.
Reporting and redmine tracking should remain separately.
Dave: Please summarize the conclusions (which are not clear to all) in an email.
**Session Close: Wed Feb 23 17:44:22 2011**
