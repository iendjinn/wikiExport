App developer API for accessing an extension inside an application
==================================================================

A general API for enabling the interaction between an application and an extension has to be specified. The process of using an extension shall be similiar to the standardized access of device features.

Initializing an extension
-------------------------

The extension has to be dynamically requested by the developer inside the web application. The cal returns a scriptable object, which can be then used to interact with the features exposed by the extension. The function call is based on the approach in Node.js to embed additional modules to the javascript runtime.[2]

<pre>
<code class="Javascript">
//Example codet how the access to an extension could look like
//initializing/requesting an extenion
var foo = requireExtension(‘fooId’);
</code>
</pre>

The requireExtension() can throw an ExtensionException, if the access to the extension could not be authorized, or the extension is not available.

Accessing properties, accessing and setting attributes or calling methods of an extension
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

After the initialization the extension shall be useable in the same way as other device features. For that reason no special API have to be defined. The accessible properties, attributes and methods of an extensions has to be defined by the extension developer

<pre>
<code class="Javascript">

//logging the value of the property ‘bar’ of the extension foo
console.log(foo.bar);

//setting the attribute hello of the extentsion foo
foo.hello = ‘World’
console.log(foo.hello);

//calling the function bar() of the extension foo with two parameters
foo.bar("Test", 1);

</code>
</pre>

Adding/Removing Listener to extension events
--------------------------------------------

The asynchronous nature of web application makes it necessary for app developers to be able to bind to Events emitted by an extension. An app developer shall be able to bind to these events in the same way as other predefined events fo web applications. Therefore the function calls for adding and removing listeners to events fired by an extension are based on W3C’s DOM 3 Event approach[1]. The developer specifies the event on which event he is going to subscribe do and the handler to be called, when the event is fired by the extensions. The event types and the coresponding event data has to be defined by the extension itself.

<pre>
<code class="Javascript">
//Adding a listener on the ‘ready’ Event, which is defined by the extension developer. When the event is emitted, the hello function is beeing invoked. hello functions removes the listener again.
foo.addEventListener(‘ready’, hello });

function hello(data){
 console.log(data);
 foo.removeListener(‘ready’);
}
</code>
</pre>
