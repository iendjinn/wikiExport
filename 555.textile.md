March 21st 2011 - Telco on Merging Context Management Context-Driven Content Adaptation
=======================================================================================

AGENDA POINTS
-------------

-   Discussion on whether to merge Context Management and Context-Driven Content Adaptation under a new Area entitled â€œContext Awarenessâ€
-   Action points for merging (or after not merging)

ATTENDEES
---------

*George (NTUA)
*Radek (AntennaVolantis)
*Hans (AmbieSense)
*Heiko, Dieter (IBBT)

MINUTES
-------

Radek: content adaptation is something quite clear and straightforward in its objectives. Context management is still in-concrete.

Hans: no problem merging, maybe â€œkeeping them together until we see they should be separatedâ€ is a good approach. Having also a bigger team may give us bigger capacity to contribute - George also concurs.

Radek: having a bigger team should not only be the primary reason for merging.

Heiko: Content adaptation is probably the â€œprimary clientâ€ of the context management area.

George: Context Management will provide the necessary information to the content adaptation, so in a potential context awareness area the two existing areas (context management, content adaptation) would do complimentary things.

Heiko: teams with 2-3 partners are too small to make an impact.

Hans: we should merge under Context Awareness and Adaptation. George agrees. Heiko agrees. Radek: we should see the scope of the new area before merging.

**Proposition:** Start with a new wiki page on Context Awareness and Adaptation by concentrating all requirements and co-shaping Scope. *NTUA to start on that asap.*

_note1: for all requirements try and make a note on to what they pertain (content adaptation, context retrieval, context sharing). And also try to provide reference and state of the art section._

_note2: Analytics could also be a potential (â€œclientâ€) area of the broad Context Awareness-Adaptation area. *GeorgeG have a call with GeorgeV on that.*_
