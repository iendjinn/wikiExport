Introduction

### Abstract

This section defines the entities within webinos and explains how they are named, identified, and authenticated. In addition, their relationships are outlined.

For definitions of terms other than entities — such as [[Glossary#synchronisation|synchronisation]], [[Glossary#discovery|discovery]], and [[Glossary#routing|routing]] — please see the [[Glossary]].

### Names and Addresses

This section is non-normative.

In general, within the realm of computing, names are used by humans and addresses by computers. For example, a website would be referred to as **www.ietf.org** by a person, but your network would only know what to do after it is instructed to send requests for web pages to **64.170.98.30**. The process of converting the identifier of an entity to a computer-usable address is called resolving.

### Issues with online identities

This section is non-normative.

Webinos is about securely sharing with others. These others must be known, looked up and addressed. For one thing, this means that identities play a major role. Nowadays, many users use their GMail or Facebook accounts as online identities. This complicates matters as this breaks the usual internet service interaction, where the server that delivers a service (email, web, chat, …) is part of the domain. With webinos, it is not forseen that Facebook, Apple and others will be running Personal Zones for users any time soon. Hence, this specification contains a mechanism to translate domains used for user identity to domains used for running the webinos service.

More background on this subject can be found at [[http://webinosblog/new_post|upcoming blog post on the webinos site by Victor]].

Entity Definitions
------------------

### User

Throughout this document, the term user refers to a person that has a webinos Personal Zone. This requires at least a live Personal Zone Hub, run by some Personal Zone Hub provider.

Users have names and identities. The current situation with online identities is somewhat confusing, but here it is assumed that webinos users have one identity which takes the form of an OpenID.

Users SHALL be identified by their OpenID identity, being either an email address or an URI. The corresponding name SHOULD be stored so the user can be addressed (by webinos and webinos applications and widgets) in a nicer manner.

### Webinos-enabled devices

These are the physical cars, TVs, phones and PCs installed with webinos. Webinos-enabled devices are normal devices with a PZP running on it, and provide a widget renderer if a webinos application runs on it. We assume a 1-to-1 mapping between device and PZP. There is only one PZP on a webinos enabled device. Nevertheless, the PZP can be re-configured if the device is shared between different persons.

Within the specification the term device is not used.

### Personal Zone (PZ)

The Personal Zone is the webinos equivalent of a user plus all his webinos-enabled devices, or PZPs. Each user has exactly one PZ, containing zero or more PZPs. Throughout the webinos specification, the term Personal Zone or PZ is only used in a non-technical sense.

### Personal Zone Hub (PZH)

The Personal Zone Hub is the main entry point to the Personal Zone. It is a server on the internet that provides an entry point to a user’s PZ. As such, it is always online - even if regular devices may not always be able to reach it - and it enforces security. It is identified by that user’s identity. Being defined as a web server it has an address in the form of a URI.

In addition, it also provides services related to the administration and management of the Personal Zone. More specifically, the PZH provided services are:

-   Administration of the PZH, PZPs and devices
-   authentication of PZHs and PZPs
-   secure communication with PZPs in the same Personal Zone and with other PZHs in different zones
-   synchronisation with PZPs in the same Personal Zone
-   webinos service management

We recommend, where possible, that a personal zone hub is given a unique sub-domain such that two hubs do not share the same origin. This is beneficial when hosting personal zone hub administration interfaces as webpages.

As outlined above, resolving the name of a PZH to an URI has some challenges, mainly because we expect that the internet domain of the User Identity will be different from the internet domain of the PZH. In short, the following mechanisms are used in the stated order:

1. OpenID attribute exchange
2. DNS NAPTR
3. Webfinger
4. Lookup service at webinos.org

A formal specification of the resolving mechanism can be found in [[http://dev.webinos.org/redmine/projects/wp3-3/wiki/Messaging_and_Routing#21-PZH-Address-Resolving|Messaging and Routing, section 2.1]].

### Personal Zone Hub Provider (PZH Provider)

A PZH provider is a Service Provider that provides all webinos services as an operator. It provides PZH services to the end users, though the PZH may physically be installed on the user’s premise. Also, users may act as their own provider.

The provider has no formal role in the webinos specification.

### Personal Zone Proxy (PZP)

The webinos PZP is a software environment residing on a device. Among others, its tasks are:
* communicating with applications
* opening up device capabilities as services that implement webinos APIs
* managing secure connections to the PZH and to other PZPs (of the same user or other users)

PZPs have a friendly name. The user SHALL have the opportunity to set this name when installing webinos onto the device. Examples of friendly names are "Peter’s phone" and "George’s PC". The friendly name MUST be unique within a single PZ.

Upon installation, the PZP SHALL generate a X.509 certificate. This certificate is used as described in [[http://dev.webinos.org/redmine/projects/wp3-3/wiki/Personal_Zone_Key_Infrastructure]].

PZPs actively connect to their own PZH. This PZH manages the mapping between connections and PZPs. When communicating from PZP to PZP locally, PZPs identify themselves with a combination of the user identity and their friendly name. The generated and signed certificates MUST be used to authenticate this connection.

### Webinos APIs

A webinos API is a collection of methods, events and properties that expose some (combination of) device capabilities to webinos applications. A webinos API can be mapped to one or more feature URIs and implemented by webinos services. Webinos APIs are defined using Web IDL [WID12] and specified collectively in [WOS34]. They are identified by their name space.

APIs cannot be invoked directly. Instead, their name space can be fed to the findServices function. As a result of invoking this function, service objects are returned on which methods can be invoked. The actual services that implement the webinos APIs are either running on the same PZP as the calling application or on a remote one.

### Webinos application

As defined in [WOS25], webinos application is "an application written using webinos technologies that will run on a device, across a range of devices reflecting the domains mobile, fix, automotive or home media and/or server. The application will be able to securely and consistently access device specific features, communicate over the cloud and adjust to the device and context specific situation." Generally there are two categories: web browser-based applications and widgets. A browser-based webinos application is hosted somewhere on the internet and connects to a PZP from a web browser. A webinos widget is a standalone self-contained web application that is developed dedicated to a specific OS. Both categories of webinos applications have access to webinos capabilities via the webinos root JavaScript object. A webinos application also has its access to security sensitive capabilities, mediated by system policy.

A webinos application can expose some or all of its capabilities as a webinos service. A webinos application should be packaged as specified in [[Widget Runtime|Widget Runtime and Webinos Applications]]. In terms of security webinos widgets can be further classified as recognised widgets (W-R) and unrecognised widgets (W-U). The types of webinos applications are listed in the following table, where a browser-based application type is an authenticated one (B-A).

  ------------- ----------------- ----------------------- ------------------------- ----------------------- ------------------- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  _.Type   _.Runs in    _.Local / hosted   _.Widget Manifest?   _.Delivered over   _.Installed?   _.Authentication

  ------------- ----------------- ----------------------- ------------------------- ----------------------- ------------------- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

It conforms to the W3C widget specification [WGT11] for both web browser-based applications and webinos widgets. Optionally widgets have a name and short name. Browser-based applications may have a name expressed in the title bar.

Widgets are identified in conformance with the W3C widget specification [WGT11]. Browser-based applications are identified by their _origin_ [RFC6454]

However, internally webinos may identify an application through a combination of the application’s name and the author’s signature attributes. All applications signed by a different author will have different identities.

A webinos application is addressed by a URI, which consists of a PZP ID, widget runtime session ID and a locally unique application ID. E.g. `http://pzh.webinos.com/john.smith%40example.com/pzpSmartTV/63639167/exampleApplication` is a valid webinos application address, where `john.smith%40example.com/pzpSmartTV` is a PZP ID, `63639167` is a session ID with a widget runtime environment, and `exampleApplication` is the local application ID, plus the PZH provider prefix, `http://pzh.webinos.com`, making it a globally unique application address.

### Webinos services

A webinos service a software system implementation of the logical interface defined by an API. The implementation is always presented to the application as client-side proxy objects, which provide a set of JavaScript functions, no matter where the implementation resides. There exist two categories of webinos services:
* PZP hosted webinos services: they are services that can be accessed remotely by using JSON-RPC. The webinos service is hosted by a PZP and the access mediated by the PEP on the PZPs of both the service consumer and the service provider.
* webinos applications providing APIs: an application is a webinos service if it presents external services as JavaScript APIs. The application service is made available through the PZP.

In terms of implementation a webinos service is packaged as normal webinos applications, using W3C widget packaging, but has no user interface. Its entry point is a JavaScript main() function (as opposed to a start page). A webinos service runs continually in the background. A webinos service can optionally be configured to autostart when the host device starts. Webinos services only run in the context of a PZP, never in the context of a PZH.

Webinos services are named as their API types. E.g. for the webinos File service, which is a webinos File API, its name is `http://webinos.org/api/file`. Different service implementations may have a same service name, as long as they implemented the same service, which is a webinos API specification.

Webinos services MAY have attributes defining aspects of their implementation, such as who provided them or where they reside.

A webinos service is identified by a URI, which consists of a PZP ID and a locally unique service ID. E.g. `http://pzh.webinos.com/john.smith%40example.com/pzpSmartTV/7493754` is a valid webinos service ID, where `john.smith%40example.com/pzpSmartTV` is a PZP ID, and `7493754` is the local service ID, plus the PZH provider prefix, `http://pzh.webinos.com`, making it a globally unique service ID.

For applications, a webinos service is not directly addressed. It is communicated through a client-side proxy object. For the webinos architecture, a webinos service ID is also its address. A service consumer is able to address the service by its ID. By parsing the ID the consumer gets the PZP address and the local service ID, and locates the service.

For applications, webinos services are resolved with the webinos Service Discovery API through the `findServices()` call, which returns a collection of client-side proxy objects. These are then used to address the service.

### Webinos widget renderer (Also known as "Widget Runtime" or WRT)

This section is non-normative.

Widget Renderers are the GUI element on each device capable of displaying a widget. We differentiate a _renderer_ from a _processor_ as the renderer only shows the widget and supports user interaction, whereas the processor unpacks the widget and manages installation. A widget renderer may be a stand-alone application, such as a browser, or may be a webinos-defined component. It is up to the implementation to actually differentiate between these concepts.

A session ID is created for each session connection between a renderer and a PZP. The format of this identifier is implementation-specific, but must not contain reserved characters for a URI, as specificed in RFC 3986 ([RFC3986]).
