API Security and Privacy Analysis Summary
-----------------------------------------

The API security and privacy analysis makes the following suggestions which are not yet incorporated into the API specifications or webinos platform, including:

### Investigate a more privacy-friendly way to implement the Discovery API

An issue also highlighted as part of the architectural risk analysis, the Discovery API is privacy-invasive because due to its use of persistant identifiers for webinos services; this facilitates user fingerprinting. For applications needing only relatively impersonal services, this API provides unnecessary information. We propose that web intents would be a potential alternative.

### Provide an alternative interface to the Messaging API

For applications which require only visibility to certain incoming patterns and the need to send occasional messages, an alternative API should be available. The current API is more invasive than may be strictly necessary. A new API might include greater restrictions - such as only being able to send a message if it has first been viewed by the end user - but could also be allowed by default to applications.

### Provide an alternative interface to the Calendar API

The Calendar API, like the Messaging API, exposes a great deal of information to requesting applications. This is unnecessarily dangerous for an application which requires only the free/busy status of an application rather than precise entry details.

### Create a ‘system level’ and ‘web app level’ distinction

A final consideration for webinos is that there are two quite separate use cases considered by the APIs.

-   Smaller applications requiring only slightly more functionality than that provided by the web browser. These are currently given more resources than they need by the Messaging, Calendar and Discovery API.
-   System-level applications which are more trusted and need to have greater access to device features. More needs to do more to ensure their webinos runtime environment is secure and immune to attacks on any hosted components.

‘web app level’ apps should be allowed to run in the browser, and use a more privacy-friendly discovery system. At the same time, these apps should restrict access to some APIs completely.

‘system level’ apps should run exclusively in a widget renderer, but have the potential to access more APIs. We recommend these only be installed from app stores and must be pre-vetted.
