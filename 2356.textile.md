Synchronisation and coherence
=============================

<span style="background:yellow">Suggest rewording from ’synchronisation’ based on new definitions. Perhaps ’consistency’ not coherence?</span>

Access control policy elements to synchronise
---------------------------------------------

This section describe which elements of a policy can be synchronized in order to share policies among PZPs and PZH in a coherent way.

In the access control policies grammar ([[Grammars_for_access_control_and_privacy_policies#Access-control-policies]]), some elements (i.e. policy-set, policy, rule) contain an id attribute useful for synchronisation purposes.

Cross-Device Policy Synchronisation Scenarios (to update)
---------------------------------------------------------

<span style="background:yellow">As per conversation with Salvatore - needs updating.</span>

_**Installing an app (’A’) on device ’D’, granting it permissions, and then wanting to allow it to use device ’E’:**_

* Assume device ‘D’ and ‘E’ are used only by the user Justin.
 * Justin "installs" ‘A’ on ‘D’.
 * At end of install process, after granting the application some permissions, Justin is prompted "This application can be used on multiple devices. Install on [list of user devices and tick box]"
 * Justin selects that the application should be installed on device ‘E’ as well.
 * Prompt: "Give application permission to access the same resources? / Customise permissions / Ask me later?"
 * Justin clicks "give same resources"
 * Webinos runtime creates a message to device ‘E’ containing instructions for doing this.
 o Name of application, permissions granted on this device
 o Justin’s credentials/signature
 * Message queued to be sent on the overlay network to the other device, using a secure transport session. This may happen immediately if possible (e.g. if device ‘D’ is a home server) or may wait for a proximity event, or may be queued on a cloud service waiting for the user to interact with device ‘D’ in the future.

_**Using device ’D’ to remove permission for app ’A’ to access resource ’R’ on all devices (Device ’D’ and ’E’):**_

* Peter has been using app ‘A’ and decides he doesn’t trust it after being told by a friend that it sends data to advertisers.
 * He is using device ‘D’, as this is his main device
 * He navigates to the policy management area (or maybe he right-clicks on the application icon) and selects "remove".
 * He is asked whether he wants it to be removed across all of his devices (a list of his local devices might be selected) and he clicks on all of them.
 * Webinos runtime generates a signed update message to each device in his cloud, including device ‘E’, in a secure manner:
 o "Remove app", app name
 o user credentials, device credentials
 * These are sent when the device is able to connect to other devices and when these devices are capable of authenticating themselves
 * Depending on the device security policies, the deletion may happen automatically, or the app might be isolated and require local permission to delete

_**Using device ’D’ to authorise app ’A’ to access resource ’P’ on device ’E’ (E and D owned by the same user):**_
_**Using device ’D’ to authorise app ’A’ to access resource ’P’ on device ’E’ (E and D owned by different users):**_

* Helen is using app ‘A’ and wants to use it to access her friend Gloria’s photos on device ‘D’.
 * She selects to discover other devices, and finds Gloria’s device ‘D’
 * She requests access to photos on ‘D’.
 * Gloria’s device prompts Gloria to allow this and presents Alice’s device details, as well as the history of communication with this device.
 * Gloria approves the communication
 * Gloria’s runtime adds a temporary permission for the photo app (resource ‘P’) on Gloria’s phone

_**Updating labels on stored user data - marking some as ’private’ on device ’D’ and having the same data on device ’E’ automatically tagged:**_

* Gloria decides to make sure her personal data is being protected appropriately
 * She looks at her webinos device to see what data about her is known
 * Some data is marked as "private" and other data is not.
 * She notes that her "place of work" is listed but not marked as private
 * She tags this data as "private" and therefore all policies apply to it that apply to other private data.
 * She tells webinos to update this setting on all her devices
 * Webinos queues a signed policy update request for device ‘E’:
 o Update policy, data item, new XACML
 o User credentials, device credentials

_**Registering device ’F’ as being a trusted device with respect to device ’D’ and device ’E’:**_

* Anna has just bought a new tablet PC (‘F’), and would like it to automatically synchronise with other devices
 * She uses it to discover her mobile phone (‘D’), a webinos device.
 * On discovery, she selects the mobile phone symbol and chooses to join the "local webinos device cloud"
 * Untrusted message from tablet to phone:
 o "device join", device ID
 * This prompts her mobile phone to authenticate her
 * She enters her credentials into the phone
 * The phone adds this device to a "known" and "personal devices" set
 * The tablet PC downloads the relevant set of policies (as well as profile info - out of scope ) from the mobile phone and applies them. This includes the identity of other devices in the cloud.
