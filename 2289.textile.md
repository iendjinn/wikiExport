Policy Editor
=============

Introduction
------------

The Policy Editor provides support for viewing and editing policies based on the webinos policy standards. You can define and modify which policies apply to which entities. The Policy Editor GUI helps specify in which services applications are allowed to access. It can also be used to define trusted relationships with other devices in order to share services.

The Policy Editor is an application with access to functionality that normal applications shouldnâ€™t: i.e., the ability to edit XACML policy files used by the PZP. This is identified by the fact that the policy editor requests access to the File API and then to the specific files used by the webinos policy framework. There’s a requirement that users are properly authenticated before making changes to access control policies with any tool which is reflected in the Authentication section.

**Policy documents**: These are XACML documents that conform to the Policy standards. They declare policies together with the subjects to which the policies apply. You can load policy documents onto the Web Policy Editor to view, load or modify.

**Policies**: These specify policy requirements. Policies are derived from the policy declarations contained in a policy document and are created automatically when a policy document is loaded.

**Group policy**: It is a nice way of managing Users, PZPâ€™s. It is can provide infrastructure in the webinos project that is used to centralize and automate the management of configuration or policy settings for users and PZPâ€™s. Group Policies are the rules that can be applied to PZPâ€™s using the Policy Editor UI. These rules can be used significantly to improve the baseline security of the webinos.

Multi user Environment
----------------------

Policies are used to limit specific applications, users and devices from doing things that the personal zone owner might not want them to do. webinos represents policies using XACML as defined in previous parts of this specification. It is expected that a webinos PZP will also have a graphical user interface to create and manage a consistent and correct security policy.

In this section we describe one implementation of a graphical user interface with the simplicity of a simple menu-driven editor that not only provides webinos with a policy in the specified syntax but also integrates techniques to support administrative policy verification. This mechanism should enable the user to clearly and correctly specify the policy and also support user verification that the specified policy is free of inconsistencies and contradictions. The purpose of this work is to analyze, design and implement a policy editor interface that guides a user to specify various attributes of the webinos security policy. The policy is stored in an intermediate XACML format.

JavaScript Policy Editor UI
---------------------------

Although XACML provides the flexibility to edit the policy file in any XACML editor, it would still be convenient to provide a graphical user interface to manipulate the policy file. This would help to eliminate inadvertent errors, and would enable global policy decisions to be applied throughout the policy file. An experienced system administrator could still capitalize on the use of the XACML policy format and edit the file in the absence of the graphical user interface (GUI), but for normal users a JavaScript based GUI was therefore proposed to create, view and modify the Policies. Using the File API that webinos provides we can have drop-down menus and dialog boxes that guide the user to input various parameters required for the policy file. To enable maintenance of the GUI, called the Policy-Editor, a separate XACML configuration file was used to feed the data.

Requirements
------------

The Policy Editor implements the following requirements:

**User policy authoring** - Security policies shall be authorable by users.

**User policy editor** - Policies shall be created and modified by users using a webinos policy editor(webinos shall allow users to express their privacy preferences consistently).

Alice has two devices registered in her Personal Zone that are connected to the PZH (Personal Zone Hub) through PZP1 (Personal Zone Proxy 1) and PZP2 (Personal Zone Proxy 2). She opens the Policy Editor on PZP1 and this presents GUI for Policy editing (PZP1_PolicyEditor). The PZP1 fetches and loads the selected Policy files to the PZP1_PolicyEditor and displays the files to Alice. She edits the File and saves them in her PZP1 which is on her Device 1. She decides to connect to the internet so that the updated file gets synchronized to the Device 2. She authenticates to the PZH and gets connected (see the Authentication specification for more details). The files are synchronized to the PZP on the Device 2. Each PZP regularly synchronises policies from the PZH which are available to the connected PZP’s. The Policy Editor allows the user to interact with a GUI, Once the user has created policies they can be modified, copied and moved within the PZP. These changes are enacted by the PZP’s.

Code Example
------------

The Policy Editor is an application that the core webinos runtime provides. It uses the similar specification provided by the File API for representing file objects in web applications, as well as programmatically selecting them and accessing their data. The Policy Editor includes the basic Interfaces that File API uses, WebIDL declaration included in the W3C File Reader specification like:

The complete webinos specification for File API can be found under the link : http://dev.webinos.org/specifications/draft/filereader.html
The complete W3C specification for the File API can be found under the link: http://www.w3.org/TR/2010/WD-FileAPI-20101026/

A Policy File can be created, copy, modified and move by using the File API.

<pre>
$(document).bind("file.create", utils.bind(this.create, this));
$(document).bind("file.copy", utils.bind(this.copy, this));
$(document).bind("file.modify", utils.bind(this.modify, this));
$(document).bind("file.move", utils.bind(this.move, this)); </pre>

The .bind() method is used for attaching an event handler directly to elements. Handlers are attached to the currently selected elements in the jQuery object, so those elements must exist at the point the call to .bind() occurs. For example, in the call.bind(‘create’, handler), the string create is the event type, and the stringname is the namespace, similarly it applies for copy, modify and move.

Screenshots
-----------

Below some screenshots of a basic webinos policy editor are presented. These screeshots show three phases of the editing process:
* binding to PZH/PZP,
* policy list retrieval
* policy editing
