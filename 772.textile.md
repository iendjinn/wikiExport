Conclusion
==========

This document contains the first iteration of the webinos security architecture. It aims to address the key outstanding threats in webinos and provide a clear conceptual framework for applications to work within.

Mitigating Threats in Webinos
-----------------------------

Threats directly considered in this deliverable include the following ([[Deliverable_References#OWASP|OWASP]]):

-   Broken Authentication and Session Management. The webinos authentication architecture includes a single sign-on mechanism and the ability to manage credentials securely. This means that a webinos-enabled application will not have to reimplement this functionality or create new user identities, reducing the likelihood of errors and vulnerabilities.
-   Insecure Cryptographic Storage. Webinos outlines requirements for secure storage and states three different levels of storage that should be made available to the runtime.
-   Failure to Restrict URL Access, Unvalidated Redirects and Forwards. Webinos applications follow the WARP standard ([[Deliverable_References#WARP|WARP]]) and are required to declare permissions before accessing external content on other sites. This significantly reduces the likelihood of this threat being realised. Furthermore, all remote javascript will either be accessed via TLS connections or have a known signature.
-   Insufficient Transport Layer Protection. All communication on webinos is via transport layer security.
-   Malicious File Execution. Only the content of the widget package can be executed, and this content is authorised by the user, signed by a trusted party and runs in an isolated sandbox on the platform.
-   Unauthorised access to services and data. User privacy and security is protected through the security and privacy architecture. The policy enforcement point prevents unauthorised access to any functionality applications were not originally granted permission for.
-   Malware on the device: malicious apps and extensions. Applications are isolated and restricted through the policy system. They are also authorised only when properly signed. Malicious applications may be identified later through the personal zone hub which is capable of checking for updates to certificates. Extensions are also controlled and subject to security checks.

In addition to these direct threats, throughout the document we have proposed systems that attempt to balance usability and security. This greatly improves on current systems which either are too difficult to use or provide inadequate controls to the user. Systems which are too difficult for the user to control are inherently not privacy preserving, as the user is unlikely to take advantage of the controls.

Finally, the best security mechanisms and designs are often rendered useless by poor implementation. Attackers at known to change the level of abstraction assumed by the implementers and exploit a bug in the code to bypass security controls. To avoid this, we have outlined some security guidance. More details on this and the evaluation process will be developed in phase two.

Remaining Threats and Future Work
---------------------------------

Many threats still need addressing, and many new technologies may be integrated into webinos. In phase two of the project and throughout development we will look into delegation & outsourcing of access control policies to increase usability. Business use cases will be considered further, making webinos more appropriate in corporate environments. Security processes such as patching, vulnerability management, and evaluation will also be outlined. Implementation details on each platform - how to provide secure storage, process isolation and usable GUIs - will be investigated. Finally, the misuse cases developed in ([[Deliverable_References#Webinos-D28|Webinos-D28]]) will feed back into these specifications and result in improvements and new threat mitigations.

Using this Deliverable
----------------------

This deliverable is designed to be used by the developers of webinos. The specifications in the Architecture section show conceptual components that must be implemented as well as overall approaches for the code. This document must be used by webinos developers, but also updated by them to reflect new risks and vulnerabilities. All developers should be aware of security guidelines and identify the trusted computing base of webinos to know which parts are most security sensitive.

These specifications are not intended to primarily be used by application developers. Most of the security framework is hidden from applications, who can take advantage of the features automatically provided. Exceptions to this are the policy framework, which is specified in deliverable 3.1, the security APIs which are given in deliverable 3.2, and the permissions system.
