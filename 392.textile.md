There are many networking technologies and these are evolving at a rapid pace. Each device may have multiple networking interfaces, e.g. a phone could have 3G, WiFi, Bluetooth, and USB. Where devices support the same networking technology, it may be practical for them to communicate directly, e.g. via WiFi. Otherwise some form of gateway is needed. In the home broadband access devices (DSL or cable modems) are evolving into home gateways that bridge multiple local area networking technologies with a firewall and Network Address Translation for connection to the Internet. For some devices the gateway will be remotely situated in the "cloud", e.g. a phone with 3G but no WiFi interface.

An overlay network is an abstraction that enables messages to be sent between devices without exposing the networking technologies and addressing schemes involved. Application developers are thus shielded from the details and instead code to the addressing scheme and interfaces exposed by the overlay network. This has two benefits: first, it reduces the effort needed to develop an application, and second, it makes applications tolerant of changes to the networking technologies and topologies used.

Implications for webinos
------------------------

-   Addressing schemes, aka naming of things

We need to define a addressing scheme for communication end points that is decoupled from the various networking technologies available. This also relates to how we are able to express metadata, e.g. describing properties of a given device or class of devices.

-   The overlay networking model assumes a layer that maps these addresses to the ones needed to route messages to a device via the available physical networking technologies. How is this mapping performed?

-   How does this layer discover the available networking technologies and their topologies?

This involves the various existing mechanisms e.g. zero configuration networking mechanisms such as UPnP SSDP, and DNS based service discovery. A further possibility is to synchronize the model with cloud based services, and to combine locally discoverable information with information held in the cloud, e.g. associated with social networks. The overlay networking model is distributed across devices, and some local devices could act as aggregators of information, facilitating discovery.

-   How are changes in the context exposed to applications?

This is important as applications may be designed to adapt to changes in the context, and we need ways to support this that doesnâ€™t mix the abstraction layers.

-   Trust models at different layers

There may be a need to map the trust model exposed to the application into the access control mechanisms used by the underlying networks, e.g. to set up logical peer to peer communication that pass through firewalls. The overlay network layer may thus need privileges to configure gateway devices accordingly. The mapping could be mediated via a policy language, but this may need to be compiled as it may be impractical to implement the policy engine on the devices involved.

-   What kind of messaging model is exposed to application developers?

The overlay networking model could expose communication end points as local proxy objects. The HTML XMLHttpRequest interface exposes the details of HTTP, but is often wrapped in a library that simplifies the model. Web developers are used to an eventing model where you can register listeners and dispatch events at target objects. For markup-based user interfaces it is common to be able to register event listeners at different levels within the object hierarchy. This is also the case for Flash-based applications. Sometimes, a simpler call-back based model is sufficient.

-   Synchronous versus asynchronous interfaces

The asynchronous messaging paradigm is very useful, but can be tedious and unnecessary in many cases. It may be practical for the objects exposed by the overlay networking model to provide synchronous access to properties that the overlay network layer synchronises with remote objects. Examples include the temperature recorded by a remote sensor, an address book or calendar that are synchronised with copies held on other devices or in the cloud. This suggests a duality between the object as exposed to the web developer, and the object as exposed to the underlying networks. Such smart objects would be provided by library developers as toolkits and represent a market for a second tier of developers.
