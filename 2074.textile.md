Application and PZP communication
=================================

Web applications and widgets will communicate with the PZP in different ways depending on the application type and the platform.

  ---------- ---------------------------- -------------
  Platform   Browser-based applications   Widgets
  Android    Web socket                   Android IPC
  Linux      Web socket                   TBC
  Windows    Web socket                   TBC
  ---------- ---------------------------- -------------

Web Socket
----------

How do browser-based applications talk to the PZP via WebSockets?

Widget Renderer communication
-----------------------------

How are we doing it on each platform?

This wonâ€™t be in a spec, but does need some documentation as an example.
