Webinos Risk Management
=======================

Introduction
------------

This document aims to be a cohesive description of the asserts, risks, threats, vulnerabilities and mitigations in the webinos platform. It takes as input the work from D2.7, D2.8, initial architectures from WP3, mitigations from T3.5, actual implementations in WP4 and future use cases and scenarios from WP5.

The rest of this document has the following structure:

1.  Assets
2.  Architectural Views
    1.  Deployment Diagrams (platform specific)
    2.  Component Diagrams

3.  Goal Trees
4.  Threats
    1.  Attack Trees

5.  Risks
    1.  Misuse Cases

6.  Mitigating requirements
7.  Vulnerabilities
8.  Risk Responses and Mitigations
    1.  Platform-specific profiles

9.  Update Process
