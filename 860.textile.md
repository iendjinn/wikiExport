WP 32 Service Discovery Breakout Session
========================================

AP: Ais, check that the first paragraph is well formatted in the service discovery widl. The paragraph should be feasible as a short description of the API.
Done

Working Assumption: For phase 2, consider how to find several types of APIâ€™s. For phase 1 only one type api can be found by the findServices method.
AP: Ais, Service might disappear during findServices process. The widl should support the possibility to remove devices from the option list.
Done: there is a new callback method and the example is updated to cover this case as well.

Working Assumption: For phase 1 it will not be possible to publish an API dynamically from a Web Application. For phase 2 it is noted that this is important.
AP: Habib to agree with AndrÃ© how UPnP resources could be made discoverable in the manifest/config.xml. Proposal ready for next phone conf (2011-06-16)
AP: Ais, provide service meta data that should be possible to expose in the manifest.

Working Assumption: Authentication API is out of scope for Service Discovery.
AP: Ais socialize with security and user profile teams.
Done, the assumption is valid according to Sven and John.

Working Assumption: WRT will handle the case to detect new devices and propose a feasible app that can be installed.
AP: Ais, to make sure that will this will be addressed within 4.
AP: Mattias TNO/ Habib + Ziran Samsung, to check how this assumption can be added to the 3.1 material.

Working assumption: mDNS, UPnP, Zeroconfig will publish services in the PZP and local devices will be discoverable. Device connected via BT/USB. Gather on Friday to revisit the architecture on Friday.
Question: Do we need to concept to use wild cards.
AP: TNO and Samsung to align their proposals and make sure it will be properly documented in WP 3.1.

Working assumption: Filtering, start with an array of strings with some pre-defined tokens or Boolean as properties of the filter object.
- Personal Zone, None Personal Zone
- Local or remote services
AP: Ais, to draft a proposal
Partly, zoneId parameter is removed but the filter interface is still undefined.
AP: Dom, to draft some material describing the expected user interaction during discovery in remote zones. Check with Daniel whether the tool chain allows for inclusion of images.
Done: links are available in the widl now.

Working assumption: DOM events, methods on DOM nodes and handling of complex data structures. For now, do more socialization and try to formulate a working assumption. Revisit the issue on Friday.
AP: Ais/Dom, to socialize and propose a working assumption.
Done: The assumption is that the name space from windows/webinos objects should be used to invoke methods. It will result in longer strings but also guarantees that Webinos will not violate how naming is done.

Working Assumption: Discovery of local resources, local resources should be discoverable and local APIâ€™s should be possible to use without invoking service discovery.
AP: Andre/Ais, to draft a proposal how it should be possible get information about yourself so it will be possible to bind to a service without invoking findServices.
Done: Proposal is on the mailing list.
