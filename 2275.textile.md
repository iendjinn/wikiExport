PZP Components & Deployment
===========================

{{toc}}

Introduction
------------

The webinos cross platform functionality is provided through the PZPs. A PZP could be implemented in different ways, below is a description of the "current":https://github.com/webinos/Webinos-Platform/tree/v0.6.0 Webinos Platform implementation. The component diagram provides a developer working on the webinos specification how different logical entities of webinos work together and this should be implemented in all webinos implementations. The deployment section is informative and does not mandate implementing the PZP as described below. It is just to provide specific details of the current implementation and give idea of how different component interact and are deployed across devices.

The current PZP implementations of webinos are developed on top of the "nodejs":http://nodejs.org/ platform. The main reason for selecting nodejs was its capability to run in multiple platforms and ease in the development. Nodejs is an event-driven application framework providing non-blocking I/O, which is useful for developing large-scale server side services and applications in JavaScript. Nodejs is build on top of "v8":http://code.google.com/p/v8/ , Google’s open source Javascript rendering engine, which allows invoking native code calls from JavaScript. The webinos code is partly implemented in JavaScript and partly in the native code.

As part of running webinos, nodejs has been ported -on- to multiple devices for car (Panda Board) and for home media (Set-top Boxes). The sections below describe all the webinos components and then show the specific changes in the platform for running nodejs and webinos code. All the platforms listed below run on nodejs except for Android which uses anode (https://github.com/paddybyers/anode), modified nodejs for running on Android platform. Anode uses Java Bridge to allow Java code instead of native C++ code to be called from JavaScript.The other platform implementations use C++ to write native code.

Apart from nodejs, webinos uses several node modules. Some node modules used are pure JavaScript code and some are mix of native code and JavaScript code. To be able to run webinos, nodejs and the webinos platform need to be installed. Instructions for installing and running are described at https://developer.webinos.org/.

Webinos PZP Components
----------------------

The PZP architecture is segmented into smaller components to handle different functionality. Each components’ functionality is considered a manager, and the dependency between components can be seen in figure 1.

Figure 1: PZP Components Interaction

These components perform actions in tandem and should be present in all PZP implementations. The implementation for each component however could be different and should match the webinos specification.

#### PZP Session Manager

PZP session manager is a combination of a TLS Client & Server and the WebSocket Server. TLS server is responsible for creation of a TLS between PZPs and WebSocket server create https session with WRT (Web RunTime). Session manager also loads user preferences during reconnect. In the current webinos implementation, this is implemented via JavaScript with nodejs functionality.

##### TLS Server & Clients

The PZP uses a TLS Client to connect to the PZH. The PZP enrollment mechanism joins a device into personal zone; the enrollment mechanism results in a certificate that allows the PZP to connect to the PZH. Each personal zone has one PZH and multiple PZPs. The PZP also runs a TLS Server to allow other PZP’s to communicate with the PZP. The PZP joining a PZH, acts as a TLS server to all other PZP’s which are already connected to the PZH. The previous connected PZPs will only be a TLS client, all subsequent PZP’s can be both a TLS client and server. The PZP in the personal zone can connect to each other because they are signed from the same entity, the PZH. PZPs outside the personal zone can connect to the PZP, if the PZH has exchanged certificates and the policy permits.

##### WebSocket Server

The PZP provides a WebSocket server to acts as a bridge between the WRT (Web RunTime) and the PZP. The role of WebSocket Server is to check the application originator certificate signature and verify that the application is allowed to communicate with the PZP, if the signature is valid WebSocket server facilitates the application to communicate with the PZP. WebSocket server also provides a way of loading the WRT application that are stored in the PZP. Request originating from the WRT communicates with the WebSocket Server and then the requests are forward towards the PZP. For response received from the PZP, WebSocket server matches the to field and send the response towards the application. In current Webinos platform it uses the node module "websocket":https://github.com/Worlize/WebSocket-Node to establish the websocket connection between the WRT and the WebSocket server.

In the Android implementation, Android Service is used instead of a WebSocket server. For Android, WebSocket Server is implemented in Java.

#### Certificate Manager

Generates certificates for PZP’s before device enrollment. The end result of this step is a certificate sign request (CSR). This CSR is then sent to the PZH to get signed. The reason for generating a CSR at the PZP end is that the CSR needs to be signed with the PZP’s private key. CSR requires signing via private key, this private key remains in PZP locally. Other functionality the Certificate Manager provides is verifying certificates at the connection time with peer trusted PZP’s. In webinos platform it is implemented in the native code using the "OpenSSL library":http://www.openssl.org/.

#### Key Storage Manager

Key Store stores the PZP private key and uses platform specific way of handling key. The keys are fetched only during connection time. Keys are fetched in memory only when required and unloaded when not required. This is a native code implementation and uses different libraries on different platforms.

#### Synchronisation Manager

Synchronises policies, certificate, user details and context object between PZH and PZP. It is an implementation of the rsync algorithm and applies a different chunk size depending on the contents of the file. In the current webinos implementation it is implemented in the JavaScript.

#### Messaging Manager

It is responsible for routing packets, handling events and forwarding packets to the Session Manager. It is a centralized place from where all other managers invoke their functionality. In the current webinos platform implementation it is implemented in the JavaScript.

#### Peer PZP Discovery

Peer PZP discovery mechanism is implemented in two ways in Webinos: the PZH assisted discovery and the PZP local discovery where local PZP’s are searched in the local area network. In the PZH assisted discovery the PZPs connection information, i.e. IP address and Port information, are sent from the PZH to the PZP and then the PZP establish communication with the other PZP. The PZP local discovery uses protocols such as ZeroConf and UPnP to find other PZPs. The PZP in local area network respond with the IP address and the connection is established with the Peer PZP. Two PZPs can connect only if they have proper certificates in place. If no proper certificate are in place, they could exchange a temporary certificate exchange between PZPs, this certificate are not to get the device in personal zone but to facilitate short communication such as communication between devices in a meeting. Current implementation is a native code implementation differing on all platforms.

#### Policy Manager

Checks and updates user policies for connection and on invocation of services. The current webinos implementation is in native code, C++.

#### Context Manager

Intercepts and collect context data for webinos services. The current webinos implementation is in JavaScript with support of the node module "jsormdb":https://github.com/deitch/jsormdb.

#### RPC Manager

RPC (Remote Procedure Call) allows Webinos APIs to invoke local or remote Webinos Services. Webinos Services are implemented on the PZP end and Webinos APIs are invoked from the WRT. The invocation of request and execution of request can be on different devices. Using findService API, a service can be found and then Webinos API are invoked to communicate with the Webinos Services using RPC. At the invocation end, RPC creates the payload to communicate with the device, and at receiving device RPC forwards the payload to the service to execute request. The current webinos implementation is in JavaScript.

#### Service Discovery Manager

This manager provides support for the _findService_ API and is basically just used as a repository holding the current services information. The current webinos implementation is a JavaScript implementation.

Platform specific implementation details
----------------------------------------

In the following sections the platform specific implementation details an features will be elaborated:
* Three PC-based implementations (Linux, Windows and Mac),
* a mobile implementation (Android),
* A Car implementation (IVI-system)

### Linux

All the components described above are implemented in the Linux platform. The platform specific implementation for Linux are in Key Storage and Peer PZP discovery. All the other components are common on all the platforms.

#### Key Storage

The webinos PZP key storage uses "Gnome Keyring":https://live.gnome.org/GnomeKeyring/ to securely store private keys. Gnome keyring unlocks the key when user login and key is accessible till the user session is login. Once user logout, other users of the system cannot access the keys. It is tightly coupled with the user login to the platform.

Gnome keyring does not protect from other applications in the system that tries to fetch keys when user is logged in, it is more up to user how he handles session.

#### Peer PZP Discovery

Peer PZP discovery which is assisted by the PZH is same on all platforms. What differs is how the local area network discovery mechanism are implemented.

The Linux implementation uses the node module mdns which uses the avahi library. Through this implementation PZP’s can find another PZP when the PZH is not reachable. "Avahi":http://www.avahi.org/ library is an implementation of ZeroConf allowing to find devices that support service "pzp". The device supporting the PZP returns the list of devices and their IP address. The PZP tries connecting to all the devices, it will be successful to only those device where it is enrolled.

### Windows

The Windows implementation differs from Linux in the Key Storage component and peer PZP discovery implementation.

#### Key Storage

This component has not been implemented yet on Windows, but one option is to use the built-in "credential management functions":http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa374731%28v=VS.85%29.aspx#credentials_management_functions

#### Peer PZP Discovery

Peer to peer PZP discovery that is assisted by PZH follows the same procedure on all platforms. Windows is not an exception.

In the case that the PZH is unreachable or direct peer to peer discovery is preferred, mdns local discovery mechanism is adopted.

Windows uses "Apple’s Bonjour library":http://www.apple.com/support/bonjour/ for Windows to have mdns functionality. Implementations of mdns for windows in Webinos is not fully supported at Javascript level due to node’s libuv does not provide the necessary abstraction/flexibility to integrate Bonjour.

### Mac

The platform specific implementations for OS X are in the Key Storage and Peer PZP discovery functionality. All the other components are common on all the platforms.

#### Key Storage

Webinos PZP key storage uses the OS X Keychain Access to securely store private keys. When a key is needed from the "Keychain Access OS X":https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/#documentation/security/conceptual/keychainServConcepts/02concepts/concepts.html will prompt the user to ask if webinos is granted access to the keychain. The user can choose if the access is granted only once or always or if the access is denied.

#### Peer PZP Discovery

Peer PZP discovery which is assisted by PZH is identical on all platforms. What differs is how the local area network discovery mechanism are implemented.

OS X uses the node mdns module just like in Linux. But different from Linux it does not use the avahi library but Apple’s own "mDNSResponder":http://opensource.apple.com/tarballs/mDNSResponder/ that is present on Mac OS X systems by default. Through this implementation PZP’s can find other PZPs when the PZH is unreachable.

### Mobile - Android

The Android implementation differs from Linux in the following aspects:

#### Anode

"Anode":https://github.com/paddybyers/anode is a beta framework for running node.js applications on Android. There are two main parts of Anode framework:
* a port of node.js to the Android OS and libraries.
* a set of Android projects that provide the integration with the Android frameworks.

Anode builds to an Android application package (.apk) that encapsulates the node.js runtime and can run node.js applications through an intent-based API.

#### Key Storage

This component has not been implemented yet on Android.

#### Peer PZP Discovery

Android follows the same procedure for PZH-assisting peer to peer PZP discovery.

In the case that the PZH is unreachable or direct peer to peer discovery is preferred, mdns local discovery mechanism is adopted by Android.

Webinos has developed its own mdns discovery implementations and exposed as Javascript APIs to web developers. This set of APIs are available for applications and webinos core components.

### IVI-system

The IVI-system implementation differs from Linux in the following aspects:

#### Vehicle Bus Access

In order to provide access to vehicle data the webinos_pzp includes a JavaScript wrapper to access the Vehicle Data Provider, which is a separate module running on the vehicle platform. The Vehicle Data provider interacts with the Media Oriented Transport System (MOST) bus.

#### Input Controler Management

As the vehicle demonstrator has a standard BMW iDrive ergo commander to control the webinos applications, the vehicle platform has an additional executable, which listens on input events from the Ergocommander and converts the CAN message into keyboard events which are passed to the browser.

#### Context manager not integrated

As the vehicle platform does not integrate the context manager due to limited resources on the embedded hardware

#### Deployment diagram

The following deployment diagram illustrates the highlighted changes on the vehicle deployment.
