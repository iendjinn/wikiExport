Area break-down
---------------

-   [[Policy_Architecture|Architecture]] (Distributed BONDI):

* ***Priority: HIGH?***
 * Where and how are policies stored on each device (BONDI)
 * Location of policy elements: where should the PEP/PDP/PIP/PAP… be?
 * How to isolate trusted components

-   [[Policy_API|Policy interaction with Apps]]:

* ***Priority: ?***
 * what will the javascript look like? (BONDI)
 * important events: install/run/iohttpfeature
 * How will native apps deal with policy: treated like "dumb devices"?

-   [[Policy_Cross_Device|Policy synchronisation, update, and cross-device interaction in general]]:

* ***Priority: HIGH ?***
 * outsourcing management of security policies to a third party (e.g. A/V vendor, a trusted friend)
 * managing the update process for policies - how to provide assurance of the source of a policy update & how policy rules interact
 * managing of policy when the (primary?) policy management points (_PIP, PDP, PAP, PEP, …_) are not reachable

-   [[Policy_Elements|Policies referring to diverse objects and ranges of user devices]]:

* ***Priority: HIGH?***
 * Need t ocome up with some "Policy use cases" describing examples of policies and how they will be used.
 * (IDM group, new schemas?, this might just be a case of prototyping some use cases?)
 * Describing & attesting device security capabilities as part of the policy environment (e.g. "this device has secure storage" or "this device can authenticate the user with a finger-print reader")
 * Policy interaction with context: how do policies refer to and alter context (BONDI, context group)
 * Policies referring to "personal" data (can we tag data and then refer to it)
 * Policies referring to "identity" data (are they different from generic "personal" data? are they only identifiers or also composed by a set of attributes that individually are not sensitive?)
 * Policies referring to a proximity event (e.g. a certain device being in range. This might even be considered authN if trusted)
 * Policies referring to XHRs to certain servers (e.g. a firewall-rule like policy)
 * Policies referring to device resource (battery, CPU) usage
 * Policies referring to device discovery
 * Policies referring to the sources of applications, plugins, the runtime itself and any updates to these
 * Policies referring to multiple sources of the same kind of data: e.g. location details from Google, GPS and the network provider. Can these data sources be grouped? (BONDI, NEW)

-   [[Policy_Logging|Policy Requests and response logging]]:

* ***Priority: LOW ?***
 * Can requests and responses from the Policy enforcement point be logged?
 * may have additional details about the reason for requests and decisions

-   [[Policy_Protection|Policy Protection]]:

* ***Priority: MEDIUM ?***
 * How do we protect policies on the device? How do we guarantee authenticity and integrity?

-   [[Policy_Interpersonal_Relationships|Interpersonal relationships and policies]]:

* ***Priority: ?***
 * How do we describe simple use cases like "I want to share my calendar with my wife"? Can these concepts be translated easily?

-   [[Policy_Usability|Usability]]:

* ***Priority: LOW?***
 * Make sure the policies remain usable for the end user by creating mock-ups.

-   [[Policy_Examples|XACML (-like) policies and configuration examples]]

* ***Priority: ?***
 * Select the best way to represent policies and configuration files.

-   [[Privileged Applications]]

* Now part of Policy management

Other items / considerations
----------------------------

-   Is the performance/memory usage a constraint ? e.g. we must put something remotely in a server because a client resident implementation is too expensive
-   How much complexity should we support in requests ? (impact the complexity of the xml to be handled and API)
-   Identify the subset of requirements that directly impacts on the future Policy Management architectural choices
-   Identify the subset of security expectations that directly impacts on the future Policy Management architectural choices
-   "Turin Meeting presentation":http://dev.webinos.org/redmine/attachments/download/371/Unict_task_3.1_policyManagement_short.pdf
-   Working definition of Policy Management: A device exposes a set of low level capabilities made available to applications through system APIs. Since applications may abuse of these capabilities, we need to introduce a component to control the access to them, matching external requests against a defined set of rules called policy. Policies could be evaluated taking into account context informations to obtain a more flexible control system. So, a definition may be: _The management of policies, rules, processes and information to control access to certain resources. In particular, the collection of systems and/or services associated with specific on-line resources and/or services that together derive the decision (privileges) about whether to allow a given entity to gain access to those resources or make use of those services [STORK Glossary and Acronyms]_
-   Input needed:

* A repository of policies — from a Policy Administration Point
 * A Request element that specifies Subject, Resource, Action, and Environment — from Access Requestor
 * A context — from environment
