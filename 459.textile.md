See "W3C current state of mobile web app technologies: data storage":http://www.w3.org/2011/02/mobile-web-app-state.html#data as a good starting point.

### Contacts API

**Description:** Access/use the native contact application and its data. e.g. the contact application of a mobile device with Android or a fixed PC where Outlook is installed.
**Requirement/architectural reference:**
* WOS-US-1.1: Smart Device Integration
* WOS-US-2.3: Converging Applications within and across Devices
* WOS-UC-TA8-004: Install-time presentation and negotiation of application policies

**webinos specific additions**
The W3C Contacts API specification defines the concept of a user’s unified address book - where address book data may be sourced from a plurality of sources - both online and locally. However, the selection of sources for this unified address book is out of scope for the W3C Contacts specification. For the multi-device useability of webinos, a function needs to be added that allows the retrieval of a list of contacts across devices using search/discovery criteria, most likely be based on the Webinos ServiceDiscovery module.

### Calendar API

**Description:** Access/use to native calendar application and its data, e.g. the calendar application of a mobile device with Android or a fixed PC where Outlook or Thunderbird are installed.
**Requirement/architectural reference:**
* WOS-US-1.1: Smart Device Integration
* WOS-US-2.3: Converging Applications within and across Devices
* WOS-US-3.3: Social Event Sharing
* WOS-US-8.2: Seamless Navigation
* WOS-UC-TA1-013: Generating Reports

Ability to subscribe to calendar entries being added, modified, deleted.|Symbian WRT 1.1||||

**webinos specific additions**
The W3C Calendar API specification is designed to be agnostic of any underlying calendaring service sources. However, the selection of sources for this calendar information is out of scope for the W3C Calendar specification. For the multi-device useability of webinos, a function needs to be added that allows the retrieval of a list of calandar data across devices using search/discovery criteria, most likely be based on the Webinos ServiceDiscovery module.

### Messaging API

**Description:** Send and receive messages of type email, SMS, MMS.
**Requirement/architectural reference:**
* WOS-US-1.1: Smart Device Integration
* WOS-US-3.3: Social Event Sharing
* WOS-US-5.1: Context Sensitive Triggering
* WOS-UC-TA1-011: Continuous monitoring of diabeticâ€™s blood glucose levels
* WOS-UC-TA7-006: The publicity and privacy of Context Information
* WOS-UC-TA8-001: Receiving local messages and alerts

**Phase:** 1 (2 for instant messaging functionality)
**Webinos responsible:** Fraunhofer
|**Candidate API**|**Short Description**|**Implementation Status**|**Gaps**|**Notes**|**Decision**|
|"W3C DAP Messaging API":http://dev.w3.org/2009/dap/messaging/|A JavaScript API for sending SMS, MMS and email based on URL schemes.

**webinos specific changes**
In addition to the message types e-mail, SMS and MMs, the webinos Messaging API also supports an ’Instant Messaging’ (or ‘Twitter’-style) type of sending and receiving messages. These are handled similar to SMS messaging, but require a different addressing scheme. Depending on the underlying messaging service, the retrieval of previous messages
might or might not be possible. To a certain extent, IM-type messages can also be used for sending text based notification messages to devices and applications as well as to users.
To support this, the basic WAC API has been extended by adding a fourth messaging type and an onInstantMessage(in OnIncomingMessage messageHandler) function. This has been done for phase 1 of webinos to allow experimentation, with a more specific and well defined set of messaging modi (e.g. Notifications) to be determined for phase 2.

h3. Multimedia/Gallery API

**Motivation for a Gallery API:**

There has been discussion as to whether a gallery is required and whether file access alone is enough. The rationale being that all media files are encapsulated as files.

There are several reasons why a gallery it would be a good idea:

* Remote galleries: file access api will not give to access to remote galleries- a common use case
* Performance: many galleries are very large. Iterating over 10,000 files may not be best way to deal with it
* Metadata and thumbnails: for media the most important thing is the meta -data- a file access method would require implementing all file types and tag formats on JavaScript. This it to complex and inefficient
* Binary data: Javascript and file access methods do not yet support binary data very well

**Description:** Access to media type files (audio, video, image) and playback.
**Requirement/architectural reference:**
* WOS-US-3.2: Sharing Music within a community social context
* WOS-US-10.1: User Centric Video Playback
* WOS-UC-TA1-012: Bridging to the Home Network
* WOS-UC-TA4-019: Ad hoc use of Foreign Devices for Playback of Film
* WOS-UC-TA7-004: Finding Devices in Close Physical and Social Proximity

**webinos specific changes**
Unlike Contacts and Calendar, the W3C Gallery API already provides a getGalleries method that allows access not only to local, but also to external galleries. While it might be useful to add a "webinos.findServices(user, "Galleries"...)" method as well (for consistency with Calendar and Contacts), this is just a possible addition, but not a necessity.

### Payment API

**Description:** And API to charge users for apps/in-app-purchase/app-usage.
**Requirement/architectural reference:** [State reference to Webinos requirement or architectural component, interface, specification etc]
**Phase:** 1
**Webinos responsible:** Fraunhofer
|**Candidate API**|**Short Description**|**Implementation Status**|**Gaps**|**Notes**|**Decision**|
|GSMA OneAPI Payment RESTful Version 1.0 ("pdf":http://www.gsmworld.com/oneapi/documents/Payment-RESTful-API-V1.0.pdf)|A RESTful API to enable to charge mobile subscribers for web application usage or content.|"Open Source Reference Implementation in PHP/Java":https://github.com/OneAPI/GSMA-OneAPI

No detailed payment functionality specified (payment itself is only via a product name, which needs to be known to the payment provider, hence essentially only direct payments to shops (payment service provider is equal to product provider) is possible)|||
|Android In-app Billing API (http://developer.android.com/guide/market/billing/index.html)|Billing API that links in-app purchasing to the Android Market account.| Android SDK API accessing the an Android Market service.| Useful API, but specific to Java and Android Market.|||

**webinos specific changes**
Since none of the existing solution provides a sufficiently generic payment solution, webinos will define a generic and simple shopping basket based solution that can be mapped to different underlying payment systems to provide a systems that can address payments on platform bound payment solutions as well as open payment services.
