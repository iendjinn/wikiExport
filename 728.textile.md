IF-MAP
======

Proposal: Webinos PZX should implement a MAP server and obey the IF-MAP protocols if possible.

Background
----------

The original IF-MAP (Metadata Access Protocol) was introduced in 2008. It
extended the TNC architecture to support standardized, dynamic data interchange
among a wide variety of networking and security components, enabling customers to
implement multi-vendor systems that provide coordinated defense-in-depth. IF-MAP acts
as a central clearinghouse for information that security devices can act on, using a
publish/subscribe model

A MAP (Metadata Access Point) is a TNC element providing the MAP Server function, which
stores state information about devices, users, and flows in a network. This information includes
registered address bindings, authentication status, endpoint policy compliance status, endpoint
behavior, and authorization status. For example, the user joe has authenticated through an
802.1X switch using an endpoint with MAC address 00:11:22:33:44:55. An endpoint assessment
has revealed that the endpoint has the proper anti-virus software installed and enabled, as
required by policy. The endpoint has subsequently been assigned IPv4 address 192.0.2.4, and
has been engaged in instant messaging (IM) traffic with the corporate IM server 192.0.2.69.

MAP Clients may publish information to a MAP, search the information in a MAP, and subscribe
to notifications from a MAP when information stored in the server changes. A single MAP Client
may publish, search, and subscribe; however, many MAP Clients are solely a publisher or a
subscriber. For example, a TNC Server publishes information about the policy compliance of an
endpoint and a Flow Controller (such as a layer 3 firewall) subscribes to notification of changes to
this information. When the TNC Server detects that the endpoint is no longer policy compliant, the
TNC Server updates the information in the MAP Server. The MAP Server notifies the Flow
Controller. The Flow Controller blocks access to the network by the newly non-compliant device.
In this example, both the TNC Server and the Flow Controller are MAP Clients. The TNC Server
is a publisher. The Flow Controller is a subscriber.

IF-MAP is the protocol used for communication between MAP Clients and Servers.

Why MAP in webinos?
-------------------

MAP should be thought of as just a simple database of facts about devices on a network. A key-value store of things like MAC addresses, users authentication events, virus scanning results, platform configurations, etc. It allows for arbitrarily complex policies to be implemented at a later date. It also has been designed to work well with TCG attestation. Trusted Network Connect is designed to be highly _interoperable_ and therefore fits with the webinos approach.

Webinos currently lacks for any network access control, which will be a problem if devices are laden with malware and threaten the security and privacy of all user devices. Access to the Personal Zone is very similar to access to a private network, which is what MAP was designed for, and so we could take advantage of the specification to build better network access control policies and prevent malicious devices from joining the Personal Zone.

For future work, certain applications might use MAP for either context data or further security queries. Javascript libraries for clients are "available already":http://ifmapdev.com/client-projects

TNC also supports federation. "More details":http://www.trustedcomputinggroup.org/resources/tnc_architecture_for_interoperability_specification . TNC also is proposed for use to remdiate problems with clients. e.g. when a virus is detected or the wrong version of a critical piece of software is used.

Roles in TNC/IF-MAP
-------------------

* Access Requestor (AR): The role of the AR is to seek access to a protected network in order
to conduct activities on the network.
 * Policy Decision Point (PDP): The role of the PDP is to perform the decision-making regarding
the ARâ€™s network access request, in light of the access policies.
 * Policy Enforcement Point (PEP): The PEP is the element which is connected to the AR; the
role of the PEP is to enforce the decisions of the PDP regarding network access. Use cases
which do not require the PEP include those which conduct network compliance monitoring,
suggest remediation recommendations, and exclude direct enforcement.

* Metadata Access Point (MAP): The role of the MAP is to store and provide state information
about ARs which may be useful to policy decision making and enforcement. This information
includes, but is not limited to, device bindings, user bindings, registered address bindings,
authentication status, endpoint policy compliance status, endpoint behavior, and
authorization status.

* MAP Client (MAPC): The role of the MAP Client is to publish to, or consume from, the MAP
state information about ARs. A MAP Client may both publish and consume state information,
and might not be directly connected to the AR.

Changes to MAP for Webinos
--------------------------

I propose that webinos implement some MAP functionality in at least the PZH and possibly the PZP too. Webinos is P2P rather than client/server, so it is not obvious how the MAP components split up. I propose:

PZP contains a MAP server and MAP client.
PZH contains a MAP server

When online, the PZP uses the PZH MAP server
When offline, the PZP uses the PZP MAP server

Note that synchronisation is probably necessary, but not too important at this stage.

Available implementations
-------------------------

There are two obvious open source implementations of IF-MAP, both listed "here":http://ifmapdev.com/server-projects
