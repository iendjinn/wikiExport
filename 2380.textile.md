Key Changes from D3.5
---------------------

This document replaces D3.5 as the security and privacy framework for the webinos platform. There are several changes between the documents, both in the structure of the framework and in the content.

### Structure

In the first phase of specification, the security and privacy specifications were split between both the D3.1 and D3.5, with D3.1 containing details on policy management and authentication, and D3.5 containing everything else. In this set of documents, D3.6 contains purely _informative_ sections whereas all _normative_ parts of the specification are now in D3.3 and D3.4. This make it clear where implementers need to go for definitive information.

Furthermore, the focus of D3.6 has been narrowed to contain the rationale behind the platform in terms of how it achieves security goals and how it mitigates threats. It also includes specific analysis of key topics, such as cloud security.

The following table outlines where each section of the security framework and specifications can be found:

  ----------------------------------- --------------------------------------------- -----------------------------------------------

Platform integrity protection has been removed because integrity assurance was considered unlikely to be implemented within the time scale of webinos. Considering the number of supported platforms this was overly ambitious in phase 1. Further investigations as part of standards activities may re-open this possibility. Extension handling has been removed from webinos in general.

### Framework changes

The main changes in the webinos specifications with relation to security and privacy are given below. In general, we have aimed to reduce the scope and complexity of the security and privacy framework and remove ambiguity.

#### Expanded certificate and key hierarchy

The webinos overlay network is secured using TLS connections between all endpoints. The full key hierarchy for this is now specified in Deliverable D3.3. It has also been extended to support client and server certificates in browsers and widget renderers. The kye hierarchy has also been designed to allow for multiple user identities such that the use of a specific key does not necessarily reveal linkable user information. More details can be found in D3.3.

#### Improvements to the authentication system

Authentication in webinos has now been clarified. Authenticating to the personal zone in general is implemented through a combination of OpenID as well as the device keys described in the personal zone key infrastructure. An important novelty of webinos is that we have avoided introducing any new usernames and passwords: users can re-use their existing credentials from other identity providers. Locally, webinos will provide user to device authentication through the authentication API. This can also be used internally. A full description of the authentication framework can be found in D3.3.

#### Removal of the attestation API

The attestation API was removed from webinos in phase 2 due to the perceived difficulties in implementing it across multiple platforms. We intend to continue investigating it in our research, but do not expect to specify its use in the rest of the project.

#### Removal of webinos-provided secure storage

The phase 1 specifications included secure storage. However, on further analysis (see the [[D036_Data_Security|Data Security]] section in the risk analysis) we concluded that implementing encryption at the webinos level would, in most cases, be unnecessary, lower performance and be a time consuming task not directly related to the main focus of the project. This is motivated by the increase in dull disk encryption products available on Android, Windows and Linux. Instead, we have defined the key requirements for platforms implementing webinos.

#### Changes to the policy architecture with respect to privacy and exceptions

The policy framework now includes an ‘exceptions’ policy file on each device which is not editable or synchronised by the rest of the personal zone. This mitigates the impact of a personal zone device being malicious, as well as the potential for misuse should the personal zone hub be compromised.

We have also updated the specifications of privacy policies to align with work from PrimeLife and integrate better into the widget manifest. This replaces the reduced P3P proposals from Deliverable 3.5. More information is available in the "Policy" section of Deliverable D3.3.
