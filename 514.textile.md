Policy Interaction Points
=========================

Introduction
------------

This document attempts to capture the different points where policy interacts with API and the system in general

It is divided into two parts

-   Description of the state of the art, which looks at WAC, BONDI, Mozilla, Chrome and W3C policy mechanisms, to identify what is real and what is implemented today
-   A more expansive view of where policy could be extended more generally

The state of the art is intended to be a lightweight overview, due to the volume of material to be covered. Extensive discussion will be held back for recommendations section

To productively assess the impact and scope of policy, a working definition will prove useful

> Policy: a set of rules that can dynamically change the behaviour of a system, when acting under a specific context.
> Within webinos: rules are generally deemed to **belong** to a user, and represent their preferences
> the security context is the action of an application, belonging to a user, accessing various discoverable functions and data
> And the effect of the policy can be in the simplest case "permit or deny", but may be extended so that the policy can effect preferences
> e.g. a policy rule could effect "preferred" bearer, or the supplier of a particular piece of data.

State of the Art
----------------

### Common browser implementations

#### Secure capabilities

A brief survey of the **security settings** in a typical web browser gives an overview of the typical controls a user directly or indirectly can impose over a classic web pages execution

-   **Cookie settings**: inhibits a web pages ability to use this general resource. Different flavours of cookie restrictions are:
    -   Donâ€™t write any cookies
    -   Don’t read any cookies
    -   Clear cookies on browser exit
-   **Images**: option to stop the presentation of images. More of an optimisation that a security setting, however the default permissions of a web page being able to present resources (images) form another domain, may introduce some limited security concerns
-   **JavaScript**: generally a coarse grained option to stop Javascript working full stop. Note however that due the high prevalence of JavaScript in modern webpages, turning this option off, would make many pages almost unusable
-   **Extensions:** different browser have different plugin technologies (ActiveX, Mozilla plugins, Chrome plugins etc). All browsers present the ability to turn this off however.
-   **Location:** the modem W3C define Geolocation API can make the devices location visible to the browser. This setting prevent this from happening
-   **History/Bookmarks:** stops the browser recording the history of sites visited.
-   **Notifications:** some modern browsers all a web page to present a notification to the user that is visible outside of the normal chrome window. This option inhibits this capability.
-   **File download:** file download is a common scenario from a browser. Downloading and mp3 presents limited security risk; downloading an executable file presents a large risk. This option give the browser control over whether this should be enabled, disabled or prompted for.
-   **Popup windows:** pop windows can be trigged by the common openwindow api. Some sites abuse this capability, creating may undesirable popups. This setting is a more recent introduction, to limit this
-   **Data sources cross domains:** principally refers to the ability for a website to request, via XMLHTTPRequest data from a site under a different domain. This powerful feature brings with it some general security weaknesses, a form of cross site scripting attach. Setting this option essentially enforces the CORS (Common …) W3C restriction.
-   **Frame behaviors:**
    -   TBD
-   **Form encryption on submission:** a less used option is the ability for browser to enforce the fact that data submitted via form must be encrypted before it reaches the browser
-   Clipboard access:* can restrict or allow a browser to interact with the current clipboard
-   **Automatic logon:** many browser support auto login features, as a usability enhancement. This setting can determine, if and sometimes how (what cached credentials are used) this works.
-   **Form field caching (remember password):** another UI enhancement that some browsers have introduced, allows a browser to save common form fields and autopopulate them, when it sees similar fields in the future. This setting can inhibit this behaviour.
-   **Report/Block malicious sites:** a feature more common in anti virus and internet security products, is a live monitor that watches sites visited and advises (or blocks) access to suspect sites. Some of this functionality is slowly being absorbed into the browser itself. This policy setting controls this behaviour.
-   **Restrict HTTPS sites to view HTTPS content:** if a site is hosted on a secure connection, in order to not compromise this security, all content (scripts and images) should also be served from a secure site. THis setting controls this behaviour.
-   **HTML5:** discussed in greater depth below, are policy setting that mediate access to security sensitive HTML5 APIs, such as local storage

IMPORTANT: almost every one of the elements described above could be described as an element of Policy. It is a rule, that represents the users preference of whether certain security sensitive capabilities or APIs should be accessible to an application. It is also important to note that no current browser allow these settings to be shared with other browsers or other devices. A scenario which is at the heart of many webinos use cases

#### Zones

One of the **contextual** elements that determines whether an application is allowed access to secure capabilities is it provenance. In classic browsing, provenance is determined by domain of origin.

Almost all current browser implement a mechanism via which domains can be clustered into different zones, that represent different trust levels. Often these can be configured but typical zones may be

* Local network
 * Intranet
 * Public internet
 * Trusted zones.

NOTE: due to know DNS weaknesses (see work on WP 2.8) only applications/websites hosted on TLS/HTTPS domains, have trusted provenance

#### Effects

When an application from a particular **zone** attempts to access a particular **capability** it will result in a predetermined **effect**

Most current browsers offer three distinct effects

-   Enable
-   Deny
-   Prompt

### W3C standardised policy mechanisms

#### SameDomain origin policy

http://www.w3.org/Security/wiki/Same_Origin_Policy
http://www.mozilla.org/projects/security/components/jssec.html

The same domain origin policy does not seems to be be **standardised" per se, but is a number of commonly understood implementation conventions that have evolved to protect againt common attacks. Originally developed by Mozilla, its conventions have not propogated onto most other browser implementations.

The principle attack it tries to mitigate, is described in the W3C document, linked

> The prohibition on receiving information is intended to prevent malicious web sites from reading confidential information from other web sites, but also prevents web content from legitimately reading information offered by other web sites. Under the same-origin policy, cross-site sending of information is also dangerous since it enables attacks such as cross-site request forgery (CSRF) and clickjackin

Practically a same domain origin policy:

** Prevents XHR from one domain to another
* Allows <script tags to be included from one domain to another
* Allows CSS files from one domain to another
* Allows images from one domain to another

#### CORS

http://www.w3.org/TR/cors/

CORS is a set of conventions (new standard) that establishes a level of trust between two domains, which exempts the pages from the same domain policy

#### Signed Scripts Policy

WARP
----

WARP is a specification that relates to the widget family of specifications.

If a widget were to fall under the same-domain origin policy (as defined above), it would be highly restricted, as it could not effectively communicate with remote web sites via XHR. Conversely, the ability to download scripts (via script tags) from any domain introduces quite serious risks, when a widget is presumed to be trusted, locally installed and has access to sensitive apis.

The WARP specification provides a way for a widget developer (or anyone who has access to the widget before signing) to explicitly define their expectations of dependency on other domains. Unlike same domain policy, WARP applies to all of

-   XHR
-   Script tags
-   CSS inclusions
-   Images

WARP is a policy of least privilege, in that it is declared by the application author (or their proxy) and the privilege for the
It is therefore principally an protection against exploitation.

For a deeper explanation of least privilege see [[Policy Negotiation]]

Widget Feature
--------------

Widget feature is another element declared explicitly by the widget author in the widget configuration file.
Like WARP it is another least privilege policy element.

Unlike WARP instead of restricting or allowing access to network resources, feature declaration is a more general mechanism for declaring access to an **extensible** resource.

For WAC and BONDI implementations these resources are generally local device APIs

### WAC and BONDI policy interaction points

The WAC and BONDI models both have the same fundamental design, being based upon the xacml model

TODO. XACML entity model reference

The principles are relatively straight forward.

A policy is made up of a many rules, that can be combined and modified in a number or ways.

Each policy element has a **target** which essentially defines a list of applicable elements.
Formally within the XACML model that bondi and WAC uses these elements are **subjects**, in the BONDI model, these subjects can be:

-   Widget identifiers (normally certificate induced) OR
-   Website identifies (URI)

WAC however is slightly more limited and subjects are only:

-   Widget identifiers.

The target element defines a coarse grained applicability or _resource requesting identities_. Once this scope is identified applicable rules are evaluated and applied.

A rule can consist of three elements

-   Subject match: Widget or web page
-   Resource match: the specific thing being accessed - eg. an API
-   Environment match: background variable, such as network, time

The full details can be found on: ….

But as a brief summary this means the following entities and resources can be currently intercepted by the security policy

-   Application requesting access, which can be:
    -   A website, hosted on a web server, which can be identified by
        -   domain
        -   certain characteristics pertaining to is certificate
    -   A widget, installed locally on device, which can be identified by
        -   its name
        -   characteristics of either its author or distributor certificate
        -   the domain from which it was installed
-   The environment, currently limited to
    -   is the device currently roaming
    -   what bearer is the device connected to
-   Resource, the thing being accessed, which can be
    -   API feature, a developer centric, specific API which can be access
    -   Device capability, and user centric classification of sensitive feature that is being access

API feature, and device capability, are essentially orthogonal, classifications of the same capability sets being accessed.

Note: when WAC revised the BONDI specifications, the API feature was dropped, now it is only possible to write policies that refer to device capabilities.

Device capabilities also support the concept of device capability parameters. These are dynamic variable dynamically evaluated in context when a feature is triggered. In other words they are the **security relevant** parameters passed to a function, which can be intercepted, evaluated and processed logically within the rules set, by the policy module.

In addition to the device capability and API feature resources which are more fully document here:…. BONDI supports the following APIs which do not map 1:1 to a **extended** JavaScript extension

-   Background operation: indicates that the application continues to function and run in the background
-   Hidden operation: indicates that the application can run in the background
-   Persistent storage: indicate that the application can make use widget specific persistent storage
-   Network utilisation: indicates that the widget is making **substantial** or **frequent** use of the network.
-   Network access: indicates the type of network access that is to be allowed by the security policy

> Note we use the term API++ above to cover the W3C Geolocation API, but we conceptually use this to represent any **sensitive** API that may be accessed, as well as parameters that may be passed to this API as variables

Summary of control triggers
---------------------------

And to complement the above, the following **environments** are a summary of the control triggers

-   Individual browser (user agent setting)
-   Application setting - declared by author - widget config
-   Global policy - independent of browser of application - but general to user - and at a micro level rule can be triggered by
    -   roaming state
    -   provenance of widget / web app
    -   trust domain of widget web app (coarser grained version of above)
    -   network bearer
    -   network resource being accessed
    -   local resource (API++) being accessed - with parameters

Summary of control event
------------------------

And finally here are the logical events, and interception points from a timing perspective - where policy should/could intercept

-   Call of a JavaScript extension function: e.g. call of W3C DAP or WAC APIs
-   Call of an inbuilt JavaScript function or DOM call e.g. window.open. (note only a few of these will be "security significant"
-   Inclusion and execution of a script tag
-   Calling XMLHTTP request - with a resource from a domain
-   Including/interpretation of image files
-   Href to "other" mime types - e.g. file download
-   And for Widgets - or installable (even hosted) web apps
    -   Installation of web application
    -   Instantiation of web application

whats missing …?

Concluding statements from the state of the art
-----------------------------------------------

What the above clearly shows is there are a lot different ways to control what can be done. Many of this techniques overlap. There is potential for streamlining and consolidating the control points. When we understand that the typical weak point to a secure implementation is the end user and their ability to understand and manage these risks, the requirement for simplification grows stronger.

Further, it is clear for a user to manage risks across cross device, cross application, cross network scenarios, we a strong argument for taking even the simple browser security controls and making them genuinely interoperable and transportable

Potential new areas to consider
-------------------------------

### Policy as persisted browser preferences

As demonstrated above existing browser already implement policy, but in a non interoperable way.

Serialising these preferences and trust zones to an interoperable data structure, would provide strong security benefits to an end users, who wishes to consumer their applications nomadically, but safely

### Policy as preference

Most policies above give a binary Yes/No response to an access request.

We could extend this to give varied responses, to represent a users preferences.

For example if an app requests access to a network resource, a typical resource will allow or disallow this request.

Instead we could imagine a policy that move a network request to an end users preferred bearer. The request has the same context of use, and same intercept point architecturally, it is only the effect that differs in this scenario

### Policy to control dependent code

Signed scripts, WARP and global policy all have techniques to mediate the relationship between on application and dependent code that may or may not be hosted under a different domain.

Dependent code is one of the strongest of all exploits, as it grants a trusted status to any code, which was not necessarily part of the original application package and may not even be hosed on the same domain.

Because of DNS vulnerabilities this becomes a critical issue.

### Policy to mediate social interactions

Policy is currently being used a mediation mechanism between and application and a sensitive resource (either local API or network)

It is clear however that many application support the notion of sharing, which is technically a trust relationship between two people and a data source (e.g. sharing and inbox or a calendar)

By enhancing the policy language to incorporate person identities, this extension may be possible

### Changing the XACML subject

In current WAC and BONDI policies the explicit subject of an rule is always an application.
This is because there is an implied subject, the user. Because implicitly we are assuming all apps run on this device which has a 1:1 relationship with a user.

A typical XACML rule, in an IT deployment context will have a user or user group as a rule subject.

As we extend BONDI/WAC runtime from their current limited one app, one device, one user context to the more fluid, multi device scenarios envisioned by webinos, it becomes clear that the core rule architecture needs revisiting to represent the subjects and contexts more appropriately
