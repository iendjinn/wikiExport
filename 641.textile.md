User ID Synchronisation
=======================

Issue
-----

-   The User -> Device relation needs to be mapped somewhere, so that devices can communicate with each other
-   This may be more complicated, e.g., there may be a level of indirection where there are "owned" devices, "friends" devices, "work" devices, etc:

* User -> Role
 * Role -> Device

-   The knowledge of these things ("associations?") will change, and needs to be synchronised between certain devices. Furthermore, it needs to be cached locally so that devices do not need to contact a central repository to access a version of this information
-   Policy information also has similar requirements, so will also be considered here. Policies will need to synchronise regularly to reflect updates to user preferences and new applications. Examples of why this is needed can be seen [[Policy_Cross_Device|here]]
-   Proposal to have a centralised IdP as well as each device providing a local IdP with cached information.

Requirements and scenarios
--------------------------

-   A description language for stating device groups and associations with users
-   An offline device-only IdP which has stored associations and identifiers.
    -   A way to query this
-   The protocol for synchronising stored device identifiers and lists
    -   For example: the first time a user attempts to use another device, the IdP is contacted. If this is successful, a brief synchronisation happens (unless it has happened recently).
    -   All devices attempt to synchronise periodically.
    -   Attestation of last device synchronisation date possible?

Security and Privacy considerations
-----------------------------------

-   Policies reveal the identity of applications and devices, as well as potentially the user and context. They should therefore be kept _confidential_.
-   Associations reveal the identity of devices and users, as well as how they work together and potentially routing information. They should therefore be kept _confidential_.
-   Policies control how device capabilities and user data are accessed. They must therefore be protected from unauthorised modification. _Integrity_ and _Authorization_ required.
-   Updates to policies or associations must propagate - this means devices must attempt to synchronise regularly. This should not be prevented.
-   The system as a whole must remain capable of functioning despite limited or no internet connectivity. _Availability_ is therefore important.
-   Privacy aims include _anonymity_, _pseudonymity_ and _unlinkability_ where possible.

These aims mean that updates and communications about policies and associations should be done either in a secure transport session (HTTPS) or via message-level encryption (SAML or WS-*). The advantage of a secure transport session is that it is easy to establish, involves little extra work or XML processing. The advantage of message-level crypto is that updates can take any path, and could potentially be forwarded like tokens by a currently-untrusted service provider or newly authorised device.

Performance considerations
--------------------------

While this problem is not so much related to pure User ID Management, it may become a problem for Policy Management as well as User Data Management, as these areas most likely handle a much bigger portion of data. Therefore, data should be distributed with performance issues in mind, i.e. a mobile device that does only need information about the userâ€™s age, should only have a local copy of this specific datum. The complete data set may then be hold by a central instance or virtually through all devices & IdPs.
