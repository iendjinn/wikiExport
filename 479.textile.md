Overlays naming and discovery
=============================

This is part of work on realizing the [[Overlay networking model]].

A study of current interconnect technologies and associated discovery mechanisms indicates that there is substantial complexity to deal with.

-   **Bluetooth** — each device has a human readable name, a 6 byte hexadecimal address, and a 24 bit code representing the service class, major and minor device class. There are some general categories of devices such as phone, headset, microphone, display, loud speakers. See "DIAC spec":https://www.bluetooth.org/Technical/AssignedNumbers/baseband.htm. Users can assign meaningful names to their devices.
-   **USB** — each device has a collection of properties of which the most important are the vendor and product IDs, together with the device class. A database is typically needed to map the pair of IDs to a description and a driver. If an entry can’t be found, the device class can be used to suggest a generic driver, e.g. for mass storage devices. Individual devices typically don’t have a unique identifier.
-   **WiFi Neighbourhood** — the network driver can be requested to scan for access points, reporting their IP address, MAC address, signal strength, network name, channel number and encryption type.
-   **Multicast DNS** — a lightweight protocol to discover devices by name or type. Users can assign meaningful names to their devices, which are located in the ".local" DNS domain. There are conventions for naming subdomains. The types can be given in terms of protocol names or MIME types. Devices can advertise external services with fixed IP addresses. Devices can report multiple services, each on a different port.
-   **SSDP** — a UPnP based discovery mechanism supported by Microsoft and Windows compatible peripherals. SSDP is a UPnP protocol using HTTP for notication announcements that give a service type URI and a unique service name.
-   **SLP** — defined in RFC 2608 and supported by Hewlett-Packard’s network printers, Novell, and Sun Microsystems, but ignored by some other large vendors. SLP works over UDP or TCP and describes devices with special URIs together with a list of name/value pairs.
-   **DLNA** — a refined version of UPnP with support for media sharing in home networks.

The overlay network should shield end users and web developers from the complexity of the various interconnect and discovery mechanisms. This means giving devices and services simple names, and mapping these internally to the associated addressing information for the given device. Simple human meaningful names are scoped by context, e.g. the TV in my bedroom, or my friend Jane’s mobile. The management of this context is an essential part of the overlay network model.

Discovery and notifications
---------------------------

The time to scan a given interconnect technology may be very quick or it may take several seconds. A further consideration is whether the operating system is capable of generating notifications at the time a device is plugged in or unplugged. In principle, we could display such notifications within the web browser.

Users may wish to search for a specific device or a specific type of device, or to see what devices are locally accessible. It should be possible to define a local naming scheme that remembers the names I have given to a device, or which suggests a name based upon the context, or where practical, the human meaningful name registered by the device itself.

### Scaling to larger networks

Multicast techniques are limited to networks with modest numbers of devices. When the number of devices matching a query rises, it is necessary to consider ways to limit the search according to the context. One approach is to introduce brokers that mediate search. The multicast technique may be sufficient to discover a local broker, which in turn can contact other brokers to expand the search without flooding the network. Peer to peer distributed search can be made to scale arbitrarily using appropriate techniques, see e.g. "Distributed Hash Tables":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributed_hash_table.

Services and drivers
--------------------

Many devices will require specific drivers. This will make it hard to interface them to web browsers, although perhaps we could investigate a means to dynamically download device specific adaptation modules that expose the device to web page scripts. It will be much easier to deal with standard services where the adaptation module works with a range of devices and can be pre-installed. The adaptation modules can be split into native code and JavaScript libraries that expose a high level interface.

### Messaging

The interconnect technology will limit the generality of messaging. A given device may support a specific low level API that has to be accessed through the appropriate driver. If an IP accessible device acts as a proxy for another locally connected device, we then need to consider how the interface exposed by the proxy could be accessed locally and remotely. We want to shield users and developers from unnecessary details, e.g. concerning passage through firewalls, network address translation or other kinds of gateways. The overlay network can always expose a service as a local JavaScript object, hiding all the communication details.

Security
--------

All of the above interconnect mechanisms allow you to discover all connected devices. You may then need to establish your rights to access the device’s services. For Bluetooth, this involves manually copying a PIN as part of the pairing process. The usability of the access control mechanism is a significant challenge. Bluetooth pairing is a pain, so is setting up the encryption for a WiFi network. Some ideas for fixing this include displaying a security token as a 2D barcode for the other device to read, or to use near field communications (NFC) that are limited to a few centimetres range.

One idea to consider is a means to pass security tokens between devices through one’s social network. If my friend shares his device with me as a preference setting on his social network profile, then I can follow the link from my profile to his via my friend connections. Our respective devices can then arrange to communicate the associated security token, which could be masked from intruders, e.g. by encrypting it with the target user’s public key. This suggests the role of the social network for accessing someone’s public key, and as a basis for managing such keys in a convenient (user friendly) manner.

### UPnP vulnerabilities

SSDP and UPnP are often vulnerable as the following links describe:

-   "Plug-N-Play Network Hacking":http://www.ethicalhacker.net/content/view/220/24/
-   "Malware FAQ: Microsoft Windows UPnP vulnerabilities":http://www.sans.org/security-resources/malwarefaq/win_upnp.php

This emphasizes the need to separate discovery from access, and to make sure that access is properly authenticated. It should also be easy for users/administrators to disable discovery of a given device.

Next steps
----------

We should pick a few use cases as a basis for driving further work. This can be done in parallel with work on browser extensions for discovery and adaptation modules for a number of common devices and interconnect technologies. One key challenge is the ability to extend the browsers on specific devices like TVs, smart phones and car head units. A short term work around is to emulate these devices using desktop and netbook computers. Another key challenge is to enable peer to peer connections, see [[P2P and NAT types]].
