Font-size increase on the TV/Vehicle
====================================

Text is one of the primary content types. It is important for it to be easy for the user to consume it, without having to strain his eyes.

### Rendering rules

We are used to watching content on desktop, tablet and mobile screens. These have similar, high resolutions optimized for the distance at which we view the content. TV’s and automotive screens aren’t optimized for this. Text has to be displayed bigger on these screens to be readable by the end user.

#### PC and Tablet

No adaptation is needed.

#### Smartphone

No adaptation is needed.

#### In-vehicle system and TV.

A procentual increase in font-size throughout the application is required. This will make sure the font-size remain the same relative to each other.

### Code example

This is a very generic adaptation rule, no relevant code example can be given here.
