Update all task 3.2 APIs according to latest W3C widl-specification.
--------------------------------------------------------------------

-   All APIs now migrated by Dom and Christian to the task 3.4 branch: http://dev.webinos.org/specifications/new/. Many thanks![]()!

-   Christian states that for the APIs that he migrated there are more to be done. Keyword for callbacks are identified as there is now a specific mechanism to describe callback functions (using the â€œcallbackâ€ keyword) that should be used instead of [NoInterfaceObject] interfaces. "Action for Christian to update all migrated APIs to use the "calback" keyword for callback functions":http://dev.webinos.org/redmine/issues/893.

-   Actions for original editors to review new version.

-   We are still missing executable of widlproc for Windows. However, Christian has been editing widls locally and then uploaded to Redmine for specification generation, without confirming that the specification generation works on the local machine. Redmine provides error messages. Claes comment: If you are using a windows machine this works for smaller changes but it is probably inefficient for major updates or new specifications so a widlproc executable for windows would be advantageous. Paddy is working on this.

-   Unchanged referred APIs from W3C and WAC to be aligned with latest versions of orginal specification. Most referred API are included in the Redmine specification repository as static html-files but a few, e.g. Calendar API, are included together with the Webinos API specifications as .widl-files. "Action for Claes to investigate format needed as input to development toolchain":http://dev.webinos.org/redmine/issues/894

-   There has been a question on the mailing list on which "frozen" revisions of Webinos APIs we need. See mail https://listen.fokus.fraunhofer.de/sympa/arc/webinos-wp3-ml/2012-05/msg00064.html. The best approach seems to be to keep the task 3.2 API specifications as documentation of the task 4.1 implementation and state any deviations in the implementation from the specification as implementation notes.

API specification alignment with task 4.1 API implementations and further work on APIs
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

See http://dev.webinos.org/redmine/projects/t3-4/wiki/API_specification_alignment_with_task_41_API_implementations

API owners for all APIs stated except:

-   Context API - NTUA or IBBT?
-   Discovery API - SoMC or Fraunhofer?

In addition we have new APIs that have been added in task 3.4, http://dev.webinos.org/redmine/projects/t3-4/wiki/New_proposed_Webinos_APIs:

-   Generic Actuator API - Andre owner
-   W3C WebRTC APIs getUserMedia and PeerConnection APIs - Martin owner
-   oAuth API - Paolo owner
-   Telephone API - proposed by Nick
-   Victor will propose two new APIs that will be presented at next week’s call

Aligning Webinos APIs with latest W3C and other standards
---------------------------------------------------------

"Aligning Webinos APIs with latest W3C and other standards":http://dev.webinos.org/redmine/projects/t3-4/wiki/Aligning_Webinos_APIs_with_latest_W3C_standards.

-   Service Discovery:
    -   Web Intents for Service Discovery? Investigation in progress, see "Task 8.1 wiki page on Web Intents":http://dev.webinos.org/redmine/projects/wp8-1/wiki/Web_Intents. Sony has submitted a proposal for extending Web Intents to support local network service discovery, http://www.w3.org/wiki/WebIntents/SonyMobile_-_Local_Network_Service_Discovery
    -   Ziran has submitted information on existing implementation status on discovery in wp4.1: http://dev.webinos.org/redmine/issues/891
    -   Need to coordinate with discovery work in task 3.3

Other
-----

Everyone to execute their Actions stated at http://dev.webinos.org/redmine/projects/t3-4/issues

Next meeting moved to Wednesday May 23 at 11.00.
