Resource overview.
------------------

Action for all partners to fill in the wiki table under "Resources":http://dev.webinos.org/redmine/projects/t3-4/wiki#Resources with estimated effort in PM and workarea. Still missing input from Antenna, Deutsche Telecom, Ercim, IBBT, Impleo, Polito, Samsung, TIS, TNO, TUB, UniCT, VisionMobile.

Update all task 3.2 APIs according to latest W3C widl-specification.
--------------------------------------------------------------------

See http://dev.webinos.org/redmine/projects/t3-4/wiki/API_specification_update_due_to_new_W3C_widlspecification.

Dom is leading migration. He has already migrated Applauncher, TV, Vehicle and Payment APIs and will continue to with context, webinos core and widget.

We do not want to spend time on migrating APIs that we have abandoned will not implement. Any more API to add to http://dev.webinos.org/redmine/projects/t3-4/wiki/Task_32_APIs_to_remove? Looking at the table at http://dev.webinos.org/redmine/projects/wp4/wiki/Delivery_status implementation status is missing for several APIs. An e-mail check gave:

Attestation module (John) - Probably removed
Authentication module (John) - Probably kept
User Profile module (Ronny) - Claes to check with Ronny
Events Module - Implemented and much used

Still need to decide how we deal with referred APIs from W3C and WAC.

API specification alignment with task 4.1 API implementations
-------------------------------------------------------------

See http://dev.webinos.org/redmine/projects/t3-4/wiki/API_specification_alignment_with_task_41_API_implementations

We need input here. Each API must have an owner/editor that is responsible for keeping the APi up to date with our implementation! Please provide feedback at this wiki page!

New proposed APIs
-----------------

See http://dev.webinos.org/redmine/projects/t3-4/wiki/New_proposed_Webinos_APIs

Pulse meter API:
Current approach is that a low level Bluetooth API will not be specified by Webinos. Instead new sensor types for which we have use cases will be added to the Webinos Sensor API. It is the implementation of the Sensor API that accesses the different sensors using the relevant low level protocols, e.g. Bluetooth.

"Action Ziran to add proposed additional sensor types to Sensor API":http://dev.webinos.org/redmine/issues/874

Aligning Webinos APIs with latest W3C and other standards
---------------------------------------------------------

See http://dev.webinos.org/redmine/projects/t3-4/wiki/Aligning_Webinos_APIs_with_latest_W3C_standards

Discussion on Gallery API. A new version of the W3C Gallery API, which is based on Web Intents, has been submitted to W3C DAP. We must start an investigation on Web Intents and Webinos. However, we also must consider the new System Level API working group that currently is formed within W3C. The work in this group will probably be very relevant to webinos.

"Action Claes to review proposed charter for the new W3C System Level API working group and initiate discussion on how Webinos should work with this group":http://dev.webinos.org/redmine/issues/875

"Action Claes to start a prestudy on Web Intents for Webinos":http://dev.webinos.org/redmine/issues/876

Everyone to execute their Actions stated at http://dev.webinos.org/redmine/projects/t3-4/issues
