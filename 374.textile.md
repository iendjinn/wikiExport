Working definition of Device/Service Discovery
----------------------------------------------

-   Device Discovery definition
    -   [The capability of a device] "to find other devices and maintain that connectivity within the same network". [1]
    -   "Device Discovery […] is a service using which a device can detect all its neighbors and make its presence known to each neighbor in the network." [2]
    -   _(Bluetooth-specific)_ "A process that allows one device to detect another device." [3]
    -   _(Bluetooth-specific)_ "A procedure for retrieving the Bluetooth device address, clock, class-of-device field and used page scan mode from discoverable devices." [4]
    -   _(ZigBee-specific)_ "Device Discovery involves interrogating a remote node for address information." [5]

A High-level definition might be: "A mechanism that allows a device to discover other locally or remotely available and discoverable devices through any of the supported networking technologies, possibly based on one or more predefined criteria, in order to obtain addressing information that’s needed to establish a connection with it.â€

High Level Architecture
-----------------------

A very high level architecture/interaction of different components involved in the webinos device and service discovery. [[Device Discovery High Level Architecture]]

At the moment application discovery is not included as it might prolong discovery process.

Functional/API model

An initial investigation on [[mNDS/DNS-SD]]

  -------------------------------------------- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- -- --------------------------------- ------------------------------

Collaboration with other groups:
--------------------------------

-   User ID Management, Overlay Network, and Context Management
    -   Overlay network for discovery mechanism effect
    -   Context management to know about proximity
    -   UserId Management: how to address devices and store them online and locally.
-   Security and policy issues
    -   To specify discovery process and propose solutions

Issues
------

-   -Naming- Naming **and addressing**:
    -   Resolve IP address using DHCP address, if no address found resolve using mDNS or AUTO IP mechanism.
    -   (Auto-)create sensible names for users and devices

-   Discovery Decision
    -   Local
    -   Remote
    -   Physical/Close proximity
    -   Social Proximity

-   Device Discovery
    -   Pointer to find properties of device (URL)
    -   Device ID (Unique ID)
    -   Device Type
    -   Mapping between User ID and Device ID - As part of authentication
    -   Advertise availability in form of alive, update (change in device situation), bye bye
    -   How to discover device DNS Query (Bonjour) or SSDP or XMPP

-   Device and Service Description
    Once device is discovered, next step is to find more about the device, each embedded system supported in device and services provided by each embedded systems. Message can be either multicast or unicast depending on architecture, in central architecture, unicast mechanism is feasible but in peer to peer multicast appears more appropriate.
    -   Root device, each embedded system in device, and services provided by each embedded system of device
    -   To include information about service, way to access service, service variables.
