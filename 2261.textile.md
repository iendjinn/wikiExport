The W3C contacts module
-----------------------

### Overview of API

http://dev.webinos.org/specifications/new/contacts.html

Provides the capability to read, write, update and delete user contacts.

### Threats

#### API-Specific threats and misuse cases

1.  an application can read all my contact details and send them to an attacker; this way the attacker can use it for spam or to collect sensitive information about contacts (not only phone number or email, but also address, birthday, photo, …).
2.  an application can modify or delete my contacts; for example change the phone number to a premium rate service.
3.  giving an application/user access to a contact can give access also to other contacts; for example I share my work contacts, but accidentially I also give access to my family and friends contacts.
4.  giving an application/user access to a contact phone number can reveal other personal information (address, birthday, photo…); for example I share the phone number of my sister, but also accidentally it gives access to her address and photo.
5.  a malicious application (or remore user) can fill the address book with dummy data (this way the user cannot add other contacts);

#### Threats based on remote invocation of this API from another device

No particular threats identified.

#### Implementation threats and possible attacks

No particular threats identified.

#### Threats to apps and developers using this API (E.g. Jimmy and Jessica)

1.  an application loading all contacts details (including photos) may risk memory problems;
2.  data protection laws and issues might arise for remotely-hosted applications loading contact details.

#### Threats to device manufacturers, operators, other stakeholders

1.  The privacy issues (ie the problems of private information being disclosed without control) convince potential users not to use the platform.

### Mitigations

1.  The policy must support parameters to select contacts (by name, by detail type, by organization…); this way only selected contacts can be accessed;
2.  The policy must allow the user to share only some details of his contacts (for example share details with type="work"); this way only selected details can be accessed;
3.  The user should be able to verify which data are available to applications/users;
4.  Untrusted applications should not be allowed write access to contacts;
5.  It may help to have an interface to show which contacts can be accessed by a particular application or user.

Applications will be granted access to this API without user consent being required. This can only be modified using a policy editor.
                                         Default allow (install time)        Widgets will need user consent at install time, but users will expect to allow it (the tick-box will automatically be filled in).                        Web pages will prompt for consent (Yes / No / Always) at runtime, this preference will be saved.
               X                         Default ask at runtime (one-shot)   Widgets will require one-off user consent at runtime. This fact will be visible & modifiable at install time.

                            X            Default deny (install time)         Widgets will require user consent at install time, but users will expect NOT to allow it (the tick-box will automatically be empty).                     Web pages will display a short notification at first-use saying that access was denied, with a button to change settings
                                         Silently deny                       2. Applications will not be granted access to this API, and users will not be asked at install time. This can only be modified using a policy editor.
