The W3C Geolocation API
-----------------------

### Overview of API

Link to API - http://www.w3.org/TR/geolocation-API/

"This specification defines an API that provides scripted access to geographical location information associated with the hosting device."

### Threats

#### API-Specific threats and misuse cases

1.  Leaking of location to unauthorised parties (e.g. through advertising networks or through spoofing of app identity)
2.  Misuse of location data by authorised parties (e.g. an app starts using location to track users rather than provide contextual functionality)
3.  Unintentional authorisation of malicious parties (e.g., users select ‘OK’ to an app they didn’t mean to. Or an app gains access through another app)
4.  Unexpected consequences of geolocation data disclosure (e.g., the user reveals their location but then realises it was a mistake in retrospect)

More details:

1.  This API gives applications access to the location of the end user, which could be privacy sensitive.
2.  It may result in advertising that the user finds annoying, it might be given away to third party advertisers, or be used for customer/user analytics at a later date (profiling). This data could end up on unauthorised websites.
3.  The application might publish this information in a way that the user has no control over, and therefore might be seen by unexpected people. E.g., someone’s friends or family might see their location without the user’s knowledge. This would be extremely bad if they were visiting a potentially sensitive or embarassing place, such as a hospital or police station. It may also be embarassing if someone learns about a relationship or interest the end user has but wishes to keep a secret.
4.  Multiple location details could be correlated over time to build up a picture of user activities. This might be used for predicting future behaviour and be inaccurate or misleading. It might also reveal habits that the user is uncomfortable with knowing.
5.  Thieves might use location data to find out whether someone is away from their house in order to burgle them. It could also tell a mugger where to wait for someone with an expensive phone, car or tablet device.
6.  Stalkers might use disclosed location data to track their target and intimidate or threaten them.
7.  In dangerous situations (e.g. in unstable countries with terrorists or unrest) this API could accidentally give away location data which would expose the end user.
8.  Inaccurate information could cause accidents or mistakes if users rely too heavily on the output of this API.
9.  Geolocation data could connect otherwise unlinkable user actions. E.g., a tweeting application and a online shopping application could correlate user identity by spotting that the user was in the same place at the same time.
10. Users might allow location data for one action, but not want to allow it forever. If the API made it easy for applications to gain and then reuse permission, this would be a problem.
11. Users might realise at a later date that their location information, as attached to some record somewhere online, was either inaccurate or privacy-invasive for some reason. E.g., it might have revealed their presence at a movie theatre when they had claimed to be unwell and off work.
12. This API might be used for a "find my phone" type application for lost or stolen devices. If it loses availability or is inaccurate, such a feature would be useless.

#### Threats based on remote invocation of this API from another device

1.  Remote invocation can result in unexpected revelation of data. E.g., an application might access location information about the users’ car, when they were expecting it to be about their TV. Different devices will be in privacy sensitive or insensitive locations, so accidentally authorising the wrong one is a problem.
2.  Remote geolocation would allow users to pretend to be in a location they are not. This might be a problem for applications relying on this information.

#### Implementation threats and possible attacks

#### Threats to apps and developers using this API (E.g. Jimmy and Jessica)

1.  A developer might base their app on geolocation in order to implement a security or privacy feature. E.g., only allowing access to certain parts of the app if they are at work, or in a certain place. This would be easy to circumvent.

#### Threats to device manufacturers, operators, other stakeholders

1.  Geolocation drains battery and (if it is assisted GPS) might use bandwidth
2.  Geolocation (if unconstrained) could slow down the phone

### Mitigations

1.  Users must be prompted before geolocation is first requested or used.
2.  Revocation of permission to access geolocation must be possible and easy to access.
3.  Insist on plausible deniability. E.g., it should always be plausible for the API to return a "no data" result.
4.  Implement a cap on the number of one-off ‘getCurrentPosition’ requests allowed
5.  Make it visible to the end user that their location is being watched or accessed by a particular app. Make it easy to turn off/on geolocation data
6.  Make the geolocation service selection easy, and do not provide access to remote geolocation by default. Device-agnostic policies should either not be possible, or not be easy to end up with.

Applications will be granted access to this API without user consent being required. This can only be modified using a policy editor.
                                         Default allow (install time)        Widgets will need user consent at install time, but users will expect to allow it (the tick-box will automatically be filled in).                        Web pages will prompt for consent (Yes / No / Always) at runtime, this preference will be saved.
  X            X            X            Default ask at runtime (one-shot)   Widgets will require one-off user consent at runtime. This fact will be visible & modifiable at install time.                                            Web pages will prompt for consent (Yes / No / Always) at runtime, this preference will be saved.                                       Default ask at runtime (every time)   Widgets will require user consent at runtime, every time. This fact will be visible & modifiable at install time.
                                         Default deny (install time)         Widgets will require user consent at install time, but users will expect NOT to allow it (the tick-box will automatically be empty).                     Web pages will display a short notification at first-use saying that access was denied, with a button to change settings
                                         Silently deny                       2. Applications will not be granted access to this API, and users will not be asked at install time. This can only be modified using a policy editor.
