WP35 Model

Some initial thoughts about a collaborative model for the 3.5 Security Architecture

Early issues
------------

-   Privacy in analytics. Analytics collection component? Fit with policy / privacy
-   Separation of components. Can we move the PEP ?
-   Diff from BONDI to Webinos. What really needs to change?
-   Minimzing the deltas from existing technology
-   Exposing device security features.
-   Is privacy handled suitably?
-   Identity management issues.
-   Where do privileged components sit?
-   Threat analysis from 2.8. How do we respond to these results?
-   Outsourcing policy management
-   General principles - section in the Deliverable?

* Not recreating components
 * Keeping the architecture simple
 * Isolation as a key mechanism
 * Attestation and evidence
