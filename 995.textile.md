Task 3.5 Interim notes
======================

#### Implementation notes

[[Assumptions during implementation]]

#### Notes from the second review

-   Need to consider the privacy implications of a personal zone: can someone remain anonymous while using webinos?
    -   Identify information leaks, which agents know what
    -   Relate this to WP5 concept apps
-   Delegation to support users is a key requirement
    -   Integrate XACML3.0? SecPal extension? We _need_ a good story for integrating delegation.
-   Intrusion detection at the PZH, least privilege
    -   Can we do a quick example app which can do some kind of traffic analysis? Any existing technology we can use?
-   More connection with cloud computing issues
    -   How does a personal zone extend to the cloud? What cloud security issues relate to webinos? Can we integrate work from the TClouds project
    -   Redo the current cloud section to make it more relevant for webinos.
-   Potential for inter-user SLAs when sharing resources
    -   Any good examples we can implement? bandwidth-sharing? Can we do some threat analysis, misusability cases, etc?
-   The model of trust is important: how do I trust each service / user
    -   Step through some scenarios… this needs more thought.

#### WP4 Integration

-   Analysis of the implementation? Where does that fit? Does it belong in this deliverable? Currently assuming a spec doesn’t discuss implementation progress, but another document might.

Potential for the following split of work effort (not in the deliverable):

| **Theory** | **Practice** |
| threats, attack trees, integration of 2.8 | Device profiles |
| specification | Prescriptive security and privacy guidelines |
| process theory | Analysis of current implementation |

Split of components:

**Core**
* Policy
* Authentication, Identity
* App security (signing, manifests, permissions)
* Extension security
* Credential Mgmt (basic)
* PZH capabilities

**Profile-specific**
* Secure storage implementation
* Privacy preserving technology (anonymous credentials, etc)
* Remote management
* GUIs for authorisation and policy decisions
* Platform integrity tools
* Hardware credential management - smart cards, etc.

Resources & Ideas
-----------------

-   How to manage revocation and expiry of keys - PZP and PZH. Can PZHs communicate between themselves to manage revocation of PZP keys? Should different devices have different length certificate validity?
-   How to manage the compromise of a PZH key?
    -   Use trusted hardware to make it unlikely
    -   Andrea’s suggestion: some kind of "red alert" message? Problems with DoS implications.

-   The SysSec D4.1 "Deliverable D4.1 - First Report on Threats on the Future Internet and Research Roadmap":http://syssec-project.eu/roadmap1 . Quotes:
    -   "Researchers should investigate how to protect users against sophisticated attacks that aim at disclosing their personal information. For example, it is important to promptly detect functionalities that can be abused to correlate data available in public records and de-anonymize user accounts in many online services."
    -   "We believe it is very important to focus our research toward the security of mobile phones. In particular, we need new tools and techniques that can be deployed to the current smartphone systems to detect and prevent attacks against the device and its applications."
    -   "We believe that a study of the usability of security countermeasures is very important and it will become even more critical in the future. If we want to progress in this direction, we need interdisciplinary efforts that bring together experts from different fields (engineering, system security, psychology, …)."

-   Need for per-device and per-scenario profiles our the security framework: which components should exist, at what levels, etc.
-   Cross-platform hardware security
-   Different credentials and passwords … where, what strength, how backed-up, etc.

-   J-PAKE
-   Attack Trees.
-   Moving the WRT into the PZP to secure communication between the two. Or alternatives.
-   Can we have a good mitigation against CSRF attacks and XSS attacks? I guess the vulnerability is that an app may load foreign content which can impersonate the user through webinos APIs. Can we turn off access to webinos APIs from any part of the app which is not mentioned in the manifest? Webinos apps with break same origin for XHRequests, so this is also a worry. This needs more thought… and CORS seems to be broken for this, to some extent - http://shreeraj.blogspot.com/2011/11/csrf-with-json-leveraging-xhr-and-cors_28.html

-   From "The Tangled Web"
    -   p214 - "Authors of many of the proposed HTML5 APIs provide no advice on preventing resource exhaustion attacks, nor do they even acknowledge this need"
    -   p222 - Timing attacks are a weakness of current web browsers. Hence the 5 second delay installing firefox plugins. Geolocation doesn’t have constraint - should webinos APIs?
-   We ought to be careful that our use of "zones" does not conflict with Internet Explorer’s use of Zones for security.
