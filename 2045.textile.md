User Authentication
===================

{{toc}}

This section describes how authentication is implemented in webinos.

Inputs:

How are users authenticated?
----------------------------

### OpenID user credentials

**Users** are primarily authenticated through their OpenID credentials. This involves them connecting to their PZH web interface and logging in with whatever account they used to register the PZH in the first place. We do not specify the authentication method required here.

Authenticating with OpenID is a pre-requisite for sensitive operations, but is not sufficient in its own right for accessing webinos APIs or other device features, necessarily. It only allows a user to connect through the PZH web interface. Applications do not have access to any enhanced privileges through this.
_Habib: Is not policy change possible only after authenticating via OpenID._

However, the user might log into the PZH web interface using their device certificate. This binds the two authentications, and therefore we could push this OpenID login event information to that PZP, so that the PZP knows that the user is not just present, but also authenticated to a higher level. This would also connect the OpenID login with a particular device.
_Habib Sentence 1: is possible only after PZP has got once signed & master certificate from PZH. Sentence 2, PZH can also provide this information irrespective of it_

Note: OpenID login MUST be requested using the PAPE extension and set max_auth_age=0 in order to prevent authentication caching.

### Device-held private key

Users may also be authenticated through a different factor: physical possession and use of a webinos device. This is established through use of the private key held on the device. Having this key is a pre-requisite for a PZP connecting to a personal zone and sharing data with other devices.

This credential can be used peer-to-peer as well as when connected to the personal zone hub. When used peer-to-peer, there is a risk of revocation having occurred but the other device not being aware of this. When used via the personal zone hub, this is not an issue, as the PZH will know if the credential has been revoked.

The device-held private key is not strictly a user authenticator, but a device authenticator. However, for many situations it can be considered another factor. E.g., for a device with generally a single owner (a mobile) then it is a perfectly reasonable authenticator for many things. It can also be considered a useful authenticator when the device is not being currently operated by the end user. E.g. a home PC being accessed remotely.

In order to make sure that a private key is used appropriately — e.g. it cannot be used by a frequently shared device as user identity — it must be integrated with the policy system and with the local device’s authentication. For instance, the private key will be held in a keyring, which requires the user to prove their presence by unlocking it. Furthermore, it can interact with the authentication API, such that an application can work out whether the user is still present or not.

_Habib: It is not clear how user presence is related to the key. Bringing in mode and state that i sent previously, we might be disconnected from hub but we could be still running. So PZP running is equivalent to User present, is that the behavior expected?_

### Presence - authenticating to the local device

Devices have different modes of interaction with users. Sometimes presence is assumed (smartphones) and sometimes it is not (shared TVs, home servers).

-   Devices with assumed presence are defined as ‘private’ devices. Their keys are marked as such. Use of these device keys implies that the user is present.
    -   If a policy refers to just the end user, and not a specific device, then these devices will automatically match this policy. E.g. "Justin can access file X" would allow Justin to access file X from his ‘private’ device.
-   Devices without assumed presence (and this is the default) are defined as ‘shared’ devices. Use of a shared device does not imply that the user is necessarily present.
    -   If a policy refers to just the end user, and is about access to a local device API, then the user must re-authenticate using the Authentication API OR OpenID.
    -   If a policy refers to just the end user, and is about access to a remote API, the the user must re-authenticate using OpenID.

The Authentication API was originally designed to allow users to demonstrate _to applications_ that are currently present.

Suggestion: should we define PZPs to have state information including "owned", "key unlocked", "locally authenticated", "connected to pzh", "owner present", "owner OpenID asserted"

_Habib: This is bit diverging from state and mode discussion, http://dev.webinos.org/redmine/projects/wp4/wiki/PZP_Modes_-_States_

h2. Authentication state machine

At any point in time, a user (or rather, their user agent) is in the following state

<div class=“uml”>(

scale 0.7

[*]--> UnknownDevice
UnknownDevice -down-> UnknownWithToken : User registers unknown device with PZH
UnknownWithToken--> UnknownDevice : Token expires
UnknownWithToken -down-> OwnedPZP : PZP exchanges ticket for a long-term PZH-granted TLS certificate
OwnedPZP--> UnknownDevice : Certificate revoked
OwnedPZP -down-> TLSConnectedPZP : PZP connects to PZH over Mutual Authenticated TLS
TLSConnectedPZP —-> OwnedPZP : The PZP disconnects from the PZH
TLSConnectedPZP -down-> UserAuthAndConnected : User logs into PZH web interface with OpenID
UserAuthAndConnected--> TLSConnectedPZP : User logs out of PZH web interface
UserAuthAndConnected --> TLSConnectedPZP : PZH web interface session expires
UnknownDevice -right-> UserAuthUnknownDevice : User logs into PZH web interface with OpenID
UserAuthUnknownDevice--> UnknownDevice : User logs out of the PZH web interface
UserAuthUnknownDevice --> UnknownDevice : PZH web interface session expires

UnknownDevice : The user is on an unknown device
UnknownDevice : There may be a virgin PZP, we don’t care
UnknownDevice : There may be many revoked keys & certs
UnknownWithToken : An unknown device with a token from the PZH
OwnedPZP : The user has a PZP with a certificate
OwnedPZP : The PZP is not connected to the PZH
TLSConnectedPZP : The PZP is owned AND connected to the PZH
UserAuthAndConnected : The PZP is connected to the PZP AND the user
UserAuthAndConnected : has logged into the PZH through OpenID
UserAuthUnknownDevice : The user is logged into the PZH through OpenID credentials.
UserAuthUnknownDevice : They are not using a known device- no TLS credentials.

note right of TLSConnectedPZP : At this stage, we know this PZP has not been revoked.
note right of UserAuthAndConnected : This is the highest level of authentication

</div>
_Habib: Unknown device does not look appropriate.. Should we make it user device. transition from UserAuthConnectedDevice to UserAuthUnknownDevice does not gel, logging to PZH web interface can incur anytime in these states_
