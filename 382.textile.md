WP35 Work Allocation and Planning
=================================

Preparation for the Turin meeting
---------------------------------

This work package on Security Architecture runs for the same time as 3.1 and has its first deliverable at the end of June (month 10). To make the most of the 5-6 months before this deadline, we would like to propose the following quick tasks for all partners with effort in this work package in preparation for the Turin meeting.

1.  Please could all partners contact Oxford with their plans for time allocation for WP3.5 and fill in the table below. As most partners only have a few months to spend over the course of this 18 month work package, we need estimates for when each partner will be contributing effort. If this is not clear yet, please could you make it available for the Turin meeting.
2.  Please could all partners prepare a short, 3-slide presentation containing:

* A summary of your security expertise / particular domain of interest.
 * Their opinions on how you can contribute to the security architecture based on the preliminary diagrams provided by Nick
 * Any key threats you are concerned about
 * Which parts of 3.1 you are working on

Planned effort and schedule

This table shows the length of the work package and highlight the months in which deliverables a due. Please add an indication of your expected effort over this period.

Communications in Webinos
-------------------------

Here are a few example communication flows in webinos which highlight issues regarding policies - e.g. the need to make decisions over distributed devices and synchronise across multiple devices.
