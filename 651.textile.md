WP31 Device, Service and Application Discovery
==============================================

Discovery mechanism involves around identifying device and exchanging service information to know more about the device and communicate with it.

In local discovery mechanism such as UPnP/ZeroConf or WiFi/Bluetooth, device discovery is done through multicast operation. After devices are discovered, it is followed by service discovery as it helps in knowing about the device and the features it supports.

In remote discovery mechanism which is possible through XMPP or DHT. Device discovery mechanism might probably go through a centralised system and discovery happens through it. Service discovery information about the device can be exchanged via JSON or XML format between devices once they are discovered and connected.

Application discovery happens more later, after devices are connected and device wants to connect to certain applications. It involves discovery about identity to use and which services to use. See more about it in "Web Introducer Analysis":http://dev.webinos.org/redmine/projects/wp3-1/wiki/Web_Introducer_investigation

Main security issue in discovery is how to identify devices and keep the information encrypted during device discovery and after devices are connected using proper key mechanism. Each of these discovery mechanisms has a different security risks and is elaborated below.

Device Discovery Security Issues/Considerations
-----------------------------------------------

### Local discovery

# Common discovery mechanism is through multicast. Most of the communication happens through a defined port and device information is advertised on specified port. Information is received by all nodes listening on port. If device information is not multicast, it will be not discoverable.
**Requirement id: PS-USR-Oxford-31, Policy Management should provide details about how to handle multicast information in user personal zone and friend zone**
# Man in the middle could try to advertise itself as a device that user is trying to connect to and retrieve all information about the user.
**Missing requirement, policy management**
# Device id for "different discovery mechanism":http://dev.webinos.org/redmine/projects/wp3-1/wiki/Addressing_and_Naming are advertised and have to be tightly coupled with user authentication.
**Requirement ID: PS-USR-Oxford-103, user identity management needs to make sure identities are properly stored and fetched**
# In local discovery, if local cache is used then it is necessary to authenticate the user before accessing list of user devices.
**Requirement ID:PS-USR-Oxford-103/PS-USR-Oxford-121, user identity management**
# Once discovery is done all the communication should preferably happen through encrypted messages but since these are embedded devices, they might not support encryption mechanism.
**Requirement ID:PS-DEV-ambiesense-08, not sure which group this falls in**
# If user wishes to connect to the user own new device, then he should identify and properly authenticate with corresponding device such as pairing with BT device or connecting via proper WiFi key.
**Requirement ID: PS-USR-Oxford-26, user identity management**
# In case user wants to connect to Friends device, the list of device should be kept separated from user device. It requires proper authentication and user device should not be discoverable in that domain.
**Requirement ID: PS-USR-Oxford-21, Device Discovery**

### Remote discovery

# It will require a central repository were all the information will be present about user and user devices. Information about the user devices should be retrievable only to properly authenticated user.
**Requirement ID: PS-USR-Oxford-4, Identity Management**
# First step is user authentication, details about authentication should be encrypted before it is delivered to the centralized system. Messages should be encrypted using public key.
**Requirement ID: :PS-DEV-ambiesense-08, key information should come from user identity management**
# Discovery is done via information provided by the central repository. It aid in finding devices based on the ids and about the status of them, whether they are alive or down. All the communication should be encrypted.
**Requirement ID: PS-DEV-ambiesense-08, key information should come from user identity management**
# Device registration should be part of the installation of the system, so that webinos system knows about the devices using webinos runtime.
**Requirement ID: LC-DWP-ISMB-010, Web application packaging, handling and Web Runtime specification**

More details will be added soon as demo for remote discovery mechanism.

Service Discovery Security Issues
---------------------------------

Services information should be available to only authenticated and connected users, messages should be encrypted and if possible to have unicast communication with the peer system. Getting information about services without connecting will lead to multicast communication and could comprise security.
**Requirement ID: PS-USR-Oxford-104, It is part of both Device Discovery and Policy Management**

Application Discovery Security Issues
-------------------------------------

# It requires user identity information to authenticate with the application. It could be done through web finger. There are security implications about user identity information that is fetched by web finger.
**Requirement ID: ID-DEV-POLITO-004, Device Discovery/Policy management**
# Choose the service user has registered for, through Web Introducer. The communication with web introducer should be secure. How the encryption will be done, since the key user by device will be for communication with device user is connected to, how the different keys will be handled for communicating with different systems.
**Requirement ID: PS-DEV-ambiesense-08, Device Discovery/User Identity Managment**

Other issues:
-------------

[As pointed out by Sven] Permission on response to a discovery request. Responding to device discovery requests should be usable, users do not want to answer to dialog boxes each time a request comes in. On the other hand, if devices answer to all requests, we have a privacy issue which the user does not want to have. Finally, there should be ways to allow automated responses to discovery requests from all of the userâ€™s own devices. For any other requests the user is to be asked. UI is needed for these questions and as there should be a policy which organises response behaviour of the device.
* This is more a usability, privacy and policy management issue*
