Privacy architecture
--------------------

### PrimeLife findings

Here follows a brief description of PrimeLife attempt to define an architecture and language for privacy policy specification. This will likely be of inspiration for the webinos definition of policy privacy architecture. Majority of information provided here comes from PrimeLife deliverable "D5.3.4":http://www.primelife.eu/images/stories/deliverables/d5.3.4-report_on_design_and_implementation-public.pdf The analysis is particularly focused on the PrimeLife Privacy Policy Language (PPL) designed for handling access control and privacy.

### Subjects

PrimeLife defines different privacy editors, actors who can define their specific privacy rules, that can be conflicting.
* Data controller, who is the entity which alone or jointly with others determines the purposes
and means of the processing of personal data
* Data subject, who is the person whose personal data are collected, held or processed by the Data Controller.

The language would be used by
* the Data Controller to specify the access restrictions to the resources that he offers;
* the Data Subject to specify access restrictions to her personal information, and how she wants her information to be treated by the Data Controller afterwards;
* the Data Controller to specify how "implicitly" collected personal information (e.g. IP addresses) will be treated;
* the Data Subject to specify how it wants this implicit information to be treated.

### Language main components

-   target :it describes the resource, the subject, and the environment variables for which this rule is applicable.
    It is described by a _<xacml:Target>_ element containing a number of nested _<xacml:AnyOf>_ and _<xacml:AllOf>_ elements.

-   credential requirements (introduced by PPL): it describes the credentials that need to be presented in order to be granted access to the resource;

-   provisional actions (introduced by PPL): it describes which actions (e.g., revealing attributes or signing statements) have to be performed by the requestor in order to be granted access;

-   condition (improved compared to XACML standard): specifying further restrictions on the applicability of the rule beyond those specified in the target and the credential requirements.
    The _<xacml:Condition>_ contains an element of type _<xacml:Expression>_ that evaluates to a Boolean.
    <CredentialAttributeDesignator> is a new element of type _<xacml:Expression>_ that can be used inside a _<xacml:Condition>_ to retrieve an attribute value from a presented credential.

-   data handling policies (introduced by PPL): describing how the information that needs to be revealed to satisfy this rule will be treated afterwards.

-   data handling preferences (introduced by PPL): describing how the information contained in the resource that is protected by this rule has to be treated.

### New elements

-   authorization element: augmented with _<AuthzUseForPurpose>._, which enumerates a list of purposes authorized to use the information, and
    _<AuthzDownstreamUsage>_, which gives the permission to forward the information protected by this policy to a third party. This authorization enables the data subject to specify the policy under which the information will be made available.

-   credential requirements: Each rule can contain a _<CredentialRequirements>_ element to specify the credentials. The _<CredentialRequirements>_ element contains a separate _<Credential>_ element for each credential that needs to be presented, plus a _<Condition>_ element describing the conditions that the attributes of these credentials have to satisfy.
    The _<Credential>_ element can contain restrictions that apply to the credential. These restrictions can be expressed two ways: by means of a list of _<AttributeMatchAnyOf>_ elements within the _<Credential>_ element, or by means of the generic _<xacml:Condition>_ element that is a sibling of the list of _<Credential>_ elements, and that contains all other conditions related to the credential attributes.

-   data handling policies: _<DataHandlingPolicy>_ element expresses what will happen to the information about the Data Subject collected during an access request. A data handling policy consists of a set of authorizations, contained in an _<AuthorizationsSet>_ element (composed of _<AuthzUseForPurpose>_ and _<AuthzDownstreamUsage>_ elements), that the Data Controller wants to obtain on the collected information, and a set of obligations, expressed in a _<ObligationsSet>_ element, that he promises to adhere to.
    Obligations are specified inside _<Obligation>_ elements, which on their turn contain a _<TriggersSet>_ element describing the events that trigger the obligation, an _<Action>_ element describing the action to be performed, and a _<Validity>_ element describing the validity time frame of the obligation.

-   data handling preferences: The data handling preferences of a rule, embedded in the _<DataHandlingPreferences>_ element, specify how the information obtained from the resource protected by this rule is to be treated after access is granted. The preferences are expressed by means of a set of authorizations and obligations, just like data handling policies. Data handling preferences always describe how the resource protected by the rule itself has to be treated, while data handling policies pertain to information that a requester will have to reveal in order to be granted access to the resource.

-   sticky policies: The sticky policy associated to a resource, meaning the agreed-upon sets of granted authorizations and promised obligations with respect to a resource, is expressed in the <StickyPolicy> element. The sticky policy is usually the result of an automated matching procedure between the data subject’s data handling preferences and the data controller’s data handling policy.

-   provisional actions: This element describes a set of provisional actions that needs to be fulfilled in order to satisfy an access control rule for certain server-side resource. The schema of the _<ProvisionalAction>_ element is consciously kept independent of the particular provisional action that needs to be fulfilled, in order to allow the possibility for the future extensions with the new provisional action types.
    In the current version of PPL specification the list of possible provisional actions includes revealing of users’ (requestor) attributes, signing a statement, "spending" the credential which is understood as a mean of restricting number of times that the same credential can be used.

Note: PPL doesn’t use the standard _<xacml:Obligations>_ element to specify the obligations because it can only be used to specify obligations that the local PEP enforces to the resource being protected. It cannot be used for data handling preferences either, since the latter specify obligations that the recipient of the resource has to adhere to, rather than the PEP that is protecting access to the resource.

### Matching mechanisms

For the basic XACML part, the tool used is the java-based Heras-af (http://www.herasaf.org/). For the Primelife privacy extension part, PrimeLife defines an Obligations Matching Engine (OME). A new component of this kind is required in PrimeLife because particular emphasis is given, to protect the privacy, to the obligations, which defines how information must be treated when not under the data subject control (e.g. how much time can be kept and stored, if they must be anonymized, if they can be forwarded to third parties, …).
Usually OME performs the matching at the data subject side, but this operation can be performed also at the data controller side: If the information is considered for forwarding to a third party (named "downstream data controller"), the data controller performs a matching between its policy and the downstream data controller.
The evaluation is performed comparing the user preferences versus the data controller policies, for each obligation. The result is "true" if the policy is more restrictive than the preference, "false" otherwise. An obligation is more restrictive if is more restrictive both on the action and on the trigger part. More restrictive on the trigger means that for each preference trigger there exists a more restrictive trigger in the policy counterpart (in the policy part can be present more triggers than in the preferences). Action and trigger matching is not fully defined, open to future extension and what "more restrictive" means could slightly differ between different OME’s implementation.

P3P vs XACML
------------

More than one privacy language are available. In the following a brief description of P3P and XACML is provided.

### Platform for Privacy Preferences Project (P3P)

From the W3C working group the P3P is define as follows.

The Platform for Privacy Preferences Project (P3P) enables Web sites to express their privacy practices in a standard format that can be retrieved automatically and interpreted easily by user agents. P3P user agents will allow users to be informed of site practices (in both machine- and human-readable formats) and to automate decision-making based on these practices when appropriate. Thus users need not read the privacy policies at every site they visit.

Although P3P provides a technical mechanism for ensuring that users can be informed about privacy policies before they release personal information, it does not provide a technical mechanism for making sure sites act according to their policies. Products implementing this specification MAY provide some assistance in that regard, but that is up to specific implementations and outside the scope of this specification. However, P3P is complementary to laws and self-regulatory programs that can provide enforcement mechanisms. In addition, P3P does not include mechanisms for transferring data or for securing personal data in transit or storage. P3P may be built into tools designed to facilitate data transfer. These tools should include appropriate security safeguards.

### eXtensible Access Control Markup Language (XACML)

The eXtensible Access Control Markup Language defines a core XML schema for representing authorization and entitlement policies.
It is an OASIS standard for managing access control policy. Released in 2003 and based on XML, the Sun-developed XACML was designed to become a universal standard for describing who has access to which resources. XACML includes a policy language and a query language that results in a Permit, Deny, Intermediate (error in query) or Not Applicable response.
XACML queries, which are typically in the SAML format, are sent to a Policy Enforcement Point (PEP), located at the file server or Web server, which forms a request to the Policy Decision Point (PDP). The PDP determines the answer based on policy and sends back its determination to the PEP. Both the PEP and PDP may be the same application in the same server or distributed across the network.

### Pros and cons

P3P a language specifically designed to handle privacy, but it has been designed for handle privacy on websites and has not successfully being extended to handle privacy on applications, yet.

As a matter of fact, Policy Manager already use a reduced set version of XACML and in order to maintain a certain coherence its use would be preferable. Moreover, bindings between privacy and policy rules would be easier to implement and maintain.

From the maturity perspective, definitely XACML is widely used and already existing projects, such as PrimeLife, has already been using it. On the other hand, P3P has not achieve such level of maturity and adoption.

In conclusion, in spite of the fact that both languages would require a `semantic driven` extension, XACML has been found to suit better webinos needs.

Ontology investigation
----------------------

### P3P ontology

The elements from the P3P ontology are used by PrimeLife in authorization tags ("PrimeLife: report on design and implementation":http://primelife.ercim.eu/images/stories/deliverables/d5.3.4-report_on_design_and_implementation-public.pdf):

### OWL ontology

The OWL Web Ontology Language ("OWL Web Ontology Language Reference":http://www.w3.org/TR/owl-ref/) is designed for use by applications that need to process the content of information instead of just presenting information to humans.
OWL language has been designed to facilitate processing of Web contents by providing additional vocabulary along with a formal semantics.
Resources are described following the "Resource Description Framework (RDF)":http://www.w3.org/TR/2002/WD-rdf-concepts-20021108/, through an "RDF Schema":http://www.w3.org/TR/2002/WD-rdf-concepts-20021108/.

OWL provides three increasingly expressive sublanguages designed for use by specific communities of implementers and users.

-   **OWL Lite**: supports those users primarily needing a classification hierarchy and simple constraints. For example, while it supports cardinality constraints, it only permits cardinality values of 0 or 1. It should be simpler to provide tool support for OWL Lite than its more expressive relatives, and OWL Lite provides a quick migration path for thesauri and other taxonomies. Owl Lite also has a lower formal complexity than OWL DL, see the section on OWL Lite in the OWL Reference for further details.

-   **OWL DL**: supports those users who want the maximum expressiveness while retaining computational completeness (all conclusions are guaranteed to be computable) and decidability (all computations will finish in finite time). OWL DL includes all OWL language constructs, but they can be used only under certain restrictions (for example, while a class may be a subclass of many classes, a class cannot be an instance of another class). OWL DL is so named due to its correspondence with description logics, a field of research that has studied the logics that form the formal foundation of OWL.

-   **OWL Full**: is meant for users who want maximum expressiveness and the syntactic freedom of RDF with no computational guarantees. For example, in OWL Full a class can be treated simultaneously as a collection of individuals and as an individual in its own right. OWL Full allows an ontology to augment the meaning of the pre-defined (RDF or OWL) vocabulary. It is unlikely that any reasoning software will be able to support complete reasoning for every feature of OWL Full.

OWL is part of the growing stack of W3C recommendations related to the Semantic Web.

From a webinos perspective, OWL is very complete as a language and it’s semantic driven. Although it is very complicated to get used to it.
Introducing such high entrance barriers by adopting this solution to describe resources in an application manifest, would affect application development and this should be considered.

### Manifests synchronization

Synchronization of policies among different PZPs, in the same Personal Zone, could affect the privacy handling, taking into consideration the scenario where the application asks for using API on another device. The issue to face there, is that the polled PZP does not have all the elements it needs to locally generate at runtime the decision: it lacks the application data handling policies.

In order to sort this out, two different solutions could be taken into account.

-   attach the application manifest (containing the data handling policies) to all the request that the application does
    -   PROS
        -   no further mechanisms of synchronization are involved
        -   it is not required to PZP to sign the attached manifest, because manifest provenance is guaranteed by the secure channel
    -   CONS
        -   overhead introduced in order to attach the application manifest to each request made by the application
        -   the application could deliver a different version of the data handling policies to different PZPs
        -   the application could change the data handling policies asking for less permissions in a deny case
        -   non trivial to implement a coherence control of the data handling policies across different personal zone, due to possible different application versions, with different manifests, installed

-   synchronize all the applications manifest among all PZPs that belongs to the same personal zone
    -   PROS
        -   application does not have any control to its manifest after being installed
    -   CONS
        -   overhead introduced by synchronizing all PZPs belonging the same PZ, with all the application manifests installed in the Personal Zone

In this second scenario the communication across different PZs must be specified. Synchronization across different Personal Zone is not a feasible solution, especially if it aim is to synchronize all the manifests of all the application installed in a Personal Zone. This would just not only introduce a big overhead due to the amount of data exchanged, but it also might break the privacy paradigm by delivering the installed applications list outside the personal zone.

Allow downstream usage
----------------------

In webinos allowing the downstream would not only be impossible, because the data controller entity is the application itself and, therefore, it does not have a matching engine, but it would also break the paradigm that has been considered so far, that leverage the concept of the application as untrusted third-party entity. Consequently data handling in webinos is expressed using a subset of the PPL language that does not include the _<authzDownstreamUsage>_ tag, because the downstream usage is always denied.

Respecting data handling policies
---------------------------------

Data handling policies are a declaration from the application that states its intentions about disclosed data.
Considering applications that will run in the webinos Run Time (WRT), the WRT itself could be the place where is feasible for the webinos backend to verify that the application respects the data handling policy declaration.
Nevertheless, this behaviour introduce a high computational complexity in order to oblige the application to respect declared limits of data usage. Furthermore, having control on some actions is still not possible even if we consider an invasive supervision by the WRT.
In case of applications that runs in a browser, there is no feasible way to check their behaviour and in this scenario data handling policies cannot be enforced if the application is considered as untrusted.
The feasible idea that stays behind is that data handling policies are meant as a _"contract"_ to from the application to the user that is informed by webinos on what the application declares to do with the data. This will help the user judging the application and prevent its use if the behaviour is unclear or doesn’t respect the obligations.
