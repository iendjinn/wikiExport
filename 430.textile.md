Webinos full meeting, February 21st 2011
========================================

**Introduction Session: Stephan Steglich**

Note: Due to flight delays, DTAG attendees have not arrived
yet, so we may need to re-order the sessions for WP2.
A group of people has just arrived, so we’re almost at full numbers
now - it seems we’re just missing the Berlin DTAG group.
Welcome by Pierfranco Rodi.
Annoucement of social event for Tuesday evening.
Stephan welcomes attendees and gives overview of
meeting objectives.
Kick off WP3
Finish WP2 Phase I
Pre[Kick Off WP4
Self assess first 6 months
Sync WP7 and WP8
Prepare review
Outlook towards WP5 and WP6
Prepare amendment #3 - if needed
And have fun and socialize.
Today WP2 meetings
Tomorrow WP2 meetings and deliverable preparation
Wednesday work on WP3
Thursday and Friday for the other WPs.
PMB meeting (primarily review preparation) on Friday as well.
Presention of GANTT char overview and current position.
Four deliverables already submitted.
Four additional deliverables to be delivered
by end of February and relevant for review.
And while 1st Periodic Report is still some time
away (month 12), we need to collect data for that
continously.
Recap of recommendations for writing deliverables.
If still possible, try to match deliverables to the recommendations.
Self review after 6 months
Good things
Lots of interest, questions at W3C event, MWC event, in Barcelona.
Need for changes?
If there is a perceived need for changes, discuss as early as possible.
No good way to collect such change proposals yet, just do that informally.
Remember that we are visible to the outside as one group, not individual companies.
Make sure we’re working efficiently with sufficient amount of productive phases.
Try to keep deliverables on time. Possibly not that critical with ‘mid-term’ deliverables, but the deliverables that coincide with review phases (month 6, 12, 24 and 36) should be on time to allow reviewers sufficient time to read.
We should be proud of the deliverables, since they
are almost all out in public and not just EU internal.
Other issues
Need to check with "Target Outcome" of project objectives from time to time.
Make sure we got answers for review about this, if asked.
Need to establish "Advisory Board" (contractual obligation)
Need to appoint "Exploitation Manager" - for now it’s Nick, but this might get deligated. Will be done in WP8 session
on Thursday afternoon.
Review will be on April 1st, 2011. Full day.
Present should be (if possible) PMB, deliverable editors,
key contributers.
For first review it is not required that all companies
are directly participating.
If we have a review preparation day in Brussels (March 31st),
IBBT can provide a meeting room.
Agenda of review has been distributed.
First project overview, then one hour on WP2, about 20 minutes for each of the other
active WPs.
Half an hour reviewer’s meeting, direct feedback on the same day (formal written review report will follow later)
Katrin will step in for Peter (who is still stuck in Munich) and chair the WP2 meeting.
Next full meeting June 6-10 in Sophia Antipolis.
Followed by 17-21 October in London.
Full year review will be likely in October again, though specific date is not known.
Presentation of webinos video on YouTube.
Christian explains use of IRC for minuting

**Start of WP2 session**
Goals:
Finalize requirements document
Agree on D2.3 conclusions
Presentation of current situation of WP2
A number of work areas are about to end, Target Platform, Requirements and Platform IPR
starting now, User expectations on security and privacy as well.
Current resource handling
2.1 needed fewer resources than expected
2.2 (?) needed more resources, evens out with available resources from 2.1
Note: Planned WP2 agenda for Torino slightly differs from agenda on BSCW.
Lessons from WP2 so far:
Netviewer didn’t work out as expected.
Wiki and MS Word did not work well together.
Peer review and quality of deliverables was good.
Difficult to involve external parties.
It’s regretable, since outside interest was large.
Slide read "Support of WAC and W3C was poor."
Question from W3C partner "In what way?"
No clear answer since Katrin was presenting slides by Peter, background of bullet point not known. Need to postpone issue until tomorrow.
Overview of user stories.
Presentation of main categories.
Use cases can also be grouped by families (as opposed to thematic categories)
Presentation of use case families follows.
Family 1: Virtual Device
Family 2: User Management
Family 3: Application Execution Environment
Family 4: Communication
Family 5: Application Lifecycle Management
Family 6: Content Adaptation
Family 7: Context Awareness
Family 8: Policies
Ajit: Problems with communicating with external partners are often based on IPR issues.
Nick: we need to get consortium agreement in place as soon as possible, will become easier if 3rd parties have a known legal framework.

**WP 2.7 presentation follows.**
Shamal Faily presenting
Example to learn from Velib bike sharing system
Short video of bike sharing shown.
Expectation - careful slow bike driving.
Real users might be juveline BMX riders jumping down stairs on bikes.
Task 2.7 are (regarding to users) our expectations of their expectations.
Presentation of 2.7 deliverable structure
Context of use presentation - often misunderstood.
Velib is the bike sharing system - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bicycle_sharing_system
User stories have been used as user context.
Definition of Personas to handle and describe user context and also
to derive threat models and expectations of all personas involved.
Twelve personas defined.
Orignally there were more, some of the personas were merged as result of Oxford meeting.
Personas in three classes: users (not surprisingly when talking about user expectations)
developer personas,
Philipp Hoschka: Users don’t seem to representative - too young, too white.
Given current funding for accessibility, 60+ persona might come in useful.
Example persona: Helen - would be willing to trade privacy for context sensitivity.
Statement alone is of limited use - model for user bases behaviour on Backing, Warrent, and Model Qualifiers.
Not only list of behaviors, but also reasoning behind that.
text in pictures difficult to read (doesn’t help in following the persentation/discussion)
List of task in relation to user personas
Task names are evocative
Case presentation: Report Disorder
Peter and the taggers…
Usability breakdown - short usuage duration, low frequency of use, medium demand on usability
apparently no user stories / use cases / personas related to economical transactions or high-security environment (e.g. remote access to Intranet) … looks strange
User expectation at install time might be different from expectations at run time.
Threat model - dealing with attacker expectations (third class of personas are attacker personas)
Based on OWASP project attacker taxonomy, OWASP essentially open data bank about attacker characteristics.
Key findings
webinos user experience shouldn’t be exploited
Identity systems should be transparent
Stakeholder do not necessarily need to be webinos users
Not all Security & Privacy decisions can be predicted.

**Moving on to 2.8,**
Not all problems are through attackers. There are also misuse cases.
2.8 also needs to cover user interaction experiments
Mockup of webinos, webinos aspects and representative applications.
Followed by empirical evaluation.
(This can only happen after specification is in place / reasonably stable)
Open issues:
Provide communication channels between 2.8 and 3.x
Dealing with redmine/word interfacing/exchange issues
Resource allocation
Question: Currently only about webinos technology, no reference to other
facturs like economic issues.
Answer: Personas mainly based on user stories, which don’t cover this issues extensively.
Nick: There are use cases that involve financial transaction.
Might be implicit in stories / use cases, but not stated explicitly
Stephan: Any more agenda for today: consortium agreement?
CA update from Nick: Current suggestions and proposals worked into CA.
Currently worked over by Fraunhofer lawyers.
Will then be sent around to partners to gather signatures.
Main purpose: Allow offering of webinos result as open source.
Read carefully Attachment 8, since this specifically contradicts the usual
EU project contribution rules.
Not trivial to align background/forground IPR rights (EU view) with Open Source
view (which does not know about such distinction).
Mention of redmine (as repository) allows to have a ‘one stop’ legal place as
opposed to the need of signing off any new mail or part of code individually.
(Though ‘redmine’ might also be some other repository.)

Meeting closed for today - continuing at 9 am tomorrow.
**Session Close: Mon Feb 21 17:21:57 2011**
