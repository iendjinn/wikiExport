Specifications
--------------

Formal Specification:
---------------------

The scope and support of providing Privileged Apps and Services into webinos applications for security:
â€¢ Preventing unauthorized access, Authenticating users, Enforcing acceptable user policies
â€¢ Authorizing all user access based on the userâ€™s role
â€¢ Identifying and monitoring shared user or device access
â€¢ Controlling access, Monitoring and reporting on all network, OS access
â€¢ Only Digitally signed applications for the extensions should be allowed to be executed by the webinos runtime.
â€¢ Grant access to exchange of Private to Public keys, Certificate, access tokens, nodes, contextual data between the PZP and PZH.
â€¢ Identify the treats and list the actions in the access control list. In case of treats block the application or the source to access the resource or the content and notify the User.
â€¢ Access control policies that restrict the extensions that try to access the OS services.

The following are the summarised and the identified Privileged requirements for webinos applications:
â€¢ Interpreting policies and taking access control decisions
â€¢ Enforcing multiple policies on multiple devices
â€¢ Policy Authorizing tools
â€¢ Cross- Device Policy Synchronisation
â€¢ Policies for the Stored data
â€¢ Dynamically Sharing Content with other Users in a Controlled Manner
â€¢ Checking access to APIs â€“ Refers to Content Adaption
â€¢ Create contexts from a pre-defined template

Two ways of using Privileged Apps and Services in webinos for security purpose:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1.) Enforce access control policies at the Runtime Environment.
2.) An Application which uses system commands and classes which manages the OS services, access rights, registries, roles based on the users and so on.

1.) Enforce access control policies at the Web Runtime Environment.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Privileged Apps Policy Examples:
The detailed description with the examples is shown how to enforce access control policies at the Web Runtime Environment which can be found in the Technical Uses Cases and Policy Examples section in the link below:

h2. Support of Privileged Apps in webinos:

**Authentication and Authorization**:

The Privileged Apps in webinos supports from the first level of User Identity. Authentication is the first step to confirm the user identity and then to grant other security properties, like authorization, permissions and access control to what resources that the user can access all the other webinos devices in the personal zone. The Discovery Mechanism identifies the other webinos devices in the personal zone and authenticates the user. The access control logs the Authentication to the personal zone (user authentication with the personal zone hub). A Notification pops up in the Userâ€™s profile that the device is enabled to access the other webinos devices in the personal zone. The Privileged Apps and Services monitors and keeps track of the personal zone identity and personal zone proxies. Once the public private key mechanism is generated, retrieving data should be all running in privilege app space updating the user credential information such as password, certificates, applications, status. Enable access to recorded decisions when the user isn’t available in real time, e.g. OAuth where a user grants a temporary right to access personal data one server to another remote server.

There is a common authorization model defined for all the trust domains and common language for expressing security policies. The Privileged apps would support authorizations at all levels of granularity. Access control domain that receives such a request will lookup authorization policies that are relevant to the authorization request. Storing Authorization and Certificates in a safe and protected place for the digitally signed applications, so that tampering with them is prevented. Once the User Identity is checked the Privileged apps would look and identify applications which have been granted particular privileges under this particular user. View a list of all their webinos applications and show the authority that certified the application for the users. Privileged apps would have restrictions of the access control policies on applications from potentially malicious applications that cause damages and support device integrity to restrict malwares. Policies shall be enforced to strongly protect from misusing device capabilities while running. Support customized encryption of any data stream. Ensuring that only trusted components are downloaded and that the applications are guaranteed some level of execution and ensure that an application does not access device features, extensions and content other than those associated to it. It would delegate decisions to a trusted third party when appropriate like what restricted capabilities that an application wants to use and to be able to do so in advance of installing or running the application.

**Discovery**:

When Discovery retrieves the address information of a device or services either through local or remote networking access the access control should check whether the address, devices or services are valid or not if it is valid then should allow access if not then it should restrict access. Similarly, If service driver is required to be installed for the device, privilege application should support the driver this would require application to be in privilege mode to be able to perform this action. The Device visibility control, device in multicast mode could be passive or active listener. (Privilege app should control the device visibility options). Access control to access different file system area and obtain user credentials information. Typical File System operation would linux to access. Capable of setting dynamic access control policies for device data when initiating an association to another webinos device.

**Context**:

User A doesnâ€™t wants to allow User B to access his (location, photo, photo-album, a playlist) and other stuffs across other devices too and So there Should be some policies defined (example: Resources/File in Deliverable 3.1 Security Specifications: http://dev.webinos.org/redmine/projects/wp3-1/wiki/Spec_-_Security). When a context manager (entity) asks for a context data it shall grant and retrieve the data and the Policies should be able to make a decision (PDP) and enforce them. Storing of device context in a file system. Privileged apps to look what purpose limitations and what data handling obligations will be agreed by the requesting party upon obtaining the user consent. Review and manage which applications users have granted permissions to, and in what context.

**Extensions**:

â€¢ Only the digitally signed applications for the extensions shall be allowed to be executed by the webinos runtime.
â€¢ A list of extensions to be logged by the Privileged Apps and Services.
â€¢ Privileged Apps and Services shall keep track of the Plug-ins, applications, untrustworthy external code, remote services if accessing the OS services, or disable them at the first instance in case of serious threats, or notify the user. By defining access control policies we can restrict the extensions that try to access the OS level

2.) An Application which uses system commands and classes which manages the OS services, access rights, registries, roles based on the users.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Since in webinos the Privileged APIs are not provided to the Application developers. An Application developer has to use the Normal APIs for developing the applications which does not access critical data. But, JavaScript APIs for browsers, Extensions, Android classes can be used to access the critical data. So the these applications have to be signed with a certificate and stored in the certificate stores in the registry of the webinos device.

Application Specification in webinos, whether it is Privileged or Not?
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Application execution is based on permissions. Privileged and normal permissions distinguish what applications can do when they run. Applications running at the privileged level have the highest permissions. They can call any API, write to all areas of the registry (including protected areas), and have full access to system files. Applications running privileged can also install certificates on the device. Privileged applications can switch to run kernel mode. Few applications need to run as privileged. In fact, allowing them to run privileged allows them to change the operating system environment, and can threaten the integrity of the device.

Applications running normal cannot access protected registry keys and system APIs. Untrusted and unprivileged applications are not normal applications, Most applications run normal. They cannot call trusted APIs, write to protected areas of the registry, write to system files or install certificates to protected stores. They can install a certificate to the Certificate store. Applications do not run if blocked because they are not allowed to execute. An application could be blocked because it is not signed by an appropriate certificate, because the user blocks it after being prompted, and so forth.

Certificate Signing for webinos devices:
----------------------------------------

OEMs, mobile operators, and application developers use certificates to sign applications and files that run on a Mobile. Certificates are contained in certificate stores in the registry of the device. Privileged Execution Trust Authorities Contains trusted certificates. Applications signed with a certificate from this store will run with privileged trust level (Trusted). Unprivileged Execution Trust Authorities contains normal Certificates. Revocation seems to be a useful concept for webinos that allows a Mobile Operator or device owner to block a specific application or group of applications. The device prevents the execution of the matching binaries. A code signing certificate or a Certificate Authority (CA) certificate can be blocked by revoking the corresponding certificate. This way, a specific application developer or a whole class of applications can be blocked. An individual executable can be blocked by revoking the hash of the binary.

Certificate Signature for webinos Application:
----------------------------------------------

If an application needs to be run as Privileged on a webinos device, then the application needs to be signed with a Privilege Certificate. By signing with a privileged certificate the application can call any API, and there are essentially no security restrictions on what the application can do and access. When a privileged application is released it should be ensured that the application is signed with a certificate that is in the privileged store of the webinos device. On the webinos devices the Application Developer should ask the OEM or mobile operator to sign the application.
For a Normal application there is no need to sign by the OEM or the mobile operator and the applications are allowed to run since there is no need for a privileged certificate that has to be signed.

XACML Policy Examples in Privilege Apps and Services:
-----------------------------------------------------

XACML Policy examples addressed in Privilege Apps and Services are:

â€¢ Access to resources/Installation controlled by the manufacturer (that provides the policy) and then by the user
â€¢ Control an application access to APIs (of an extension or not)
â€¢ Policies for an Application Installer, A process viewer and Policy management application
â€¢ Merge two Processes
â€¢ HasPrivilegesOfRole Policies and Requests
â€¢ Policies based on Subject and Resource attributes

Please find the examples under this link:
http://dev.webinos.org/redmine/projects/wp3-1/wiki/Privileged_Applications

**Policies based on Subjects and Resources**:

If an authorization decision is required to base on some characteristic of the subject other than its identity. Then, the most common application is the subjectâ€™s role RBAC (Role Based Access Control). XACML provides facilities to support this approach. The corresponding policy must also contain a reference to the subject identified in the information resource itself.

Attributes of subjects may be identified by the <SubjectAttributeDesignator> element. This element contains a URN that identifies the attribute. The <AttributeSelector> element may contain an XPath expression over the request context to identify a particular subject attribute value by its location in the context.

Conceptual components

section: Sequence Diagram Analysis

â€¢ Security Policy, Privilege Monitor and Privilege manager:

Security Policy: A collection of access control constraints, abstractly representable as a policy-set, as defined in the security policy model in this specification, that describes the circumstances under which Web Applications are permitted to access Features and underlying Device Capabilities.

Privilege Monitor and Privilege Manager will log privileged application activity that would fail under a standard user account. For an application to log activity you must enable Privilege Monitoring in the Application Privileges or Shell Integration sections of the policy, when you insert an application group.

â€¢ Access to resources:

Access to Resources based on the security policies and access controls these resources may be a package, attribute, data related to physical entities like (CD player, Camera, Engine), Configuration specification, containing the various files and digital signatures.

â€¢ The GUI interfaces for the Privilege Apps and Services are: Application Installation, Package and Launcher

The Application Installation verifies the digital signature of the application packages and allows or disallows the installation of an application based on the packages selected. Launcher verifies that an application loads the required files. The Packages consists of data pertaining to the resources, extensions, Manifests and so on.

â€¢ Certificate Store:

A certificate store will often have numerous certificates, possibly issued from a number of a different certification authorities. It consists of key pairs that encrypt and decrypt the symmetric key used for encrypting and decrypting data by Encrypting File System, digital certificates and so on.

Protocols
---------

**Device Management**:

webinos shall provide Device management for updating of the software that resides on the system or of the system configuration itself.

Supported Device Management scenarios include:
* Installing application software, a complete image, or critical patches and fixes
* Uninstalling or reinstalling application software
* Activating or deactivating installed applications
* Adjusting the userâ€™s configuration

The protocols for the following device management capabilities are:

â€¢ Configuration management: These Protocols focuses on establishing and maintaining consistency of a device’s performance and its functional and physical attributes with its requirements, design, and operational information throughout the process.
â€¢ Software and hardware management: Its purpose is to provide a standard interface to configure and operate. It looks for versioning, building, packaging, configuring and installing.
â€¢ Notification (alert): Represents how a persistent notification is to be presented to the user using the NotificationManager.
â€¢ Logging: Log if there are any errors, log records to a variety of destinations such as log files or the console.
â€¢ Remote Monitoring and Remote Diagnostics: Monitor and anaylse the protocols set on the device and check for network connections remotely. Identify the faults and errors in the network and diagnose.

**Privacy Certificate Authority Protocols**

â€¢ Token Formats:

Security token is a representation of a collection of any claims, so what to be defined here are the definitions of token formats for this Privacy-CA protocol. The two token formats are as follows:
1)Identity Certificate request Token: This token shall be placed in Identity Credential Request element when Requesting a identity certificate.
2)Identity certificate response Token: This token shall be an encrypted and encoded identity certificate. It is returned from the Privacy CA (A trusted third party that issues platform identities) to the platform.

â€¢ Remote Data Binding Protocol:

The Remote Data Binding Protocol ensures that the tickets are encrypted by a key that is known only to the ticket issuer, thus event the device owner cannot access the tickets data.
