Online meeting 2012-05-23
=========================

Attendees
---------

Update all task 3.2 APIs according to latest W3C widl-specification.
--------------------------------------------------------------------

-   Actions for original editors to review new version.

-   Executable of widlproc for Windows. Nick to check status with Paddy.

-   How to deal with referred APIs? Development tool chain needs:
    -   Code stub generation - Nice to have but not absolutely mandatory
    -   Input to the Eclipse SDK

For some referred APIs we only have static html files, e.g. DeviceOrientation, Geolocation etc. See http://dev.webinos.org/redmine/projects/t3-2/repository/revisions/newwebidl/show/sources/static. However, we need full widls to support development tool chain.

Also good to have widls as basis for webinos updates to the referred APIs.

Action Claes to check with check with DOM or Dave to get W3C specification widls. Marcos WAC?

API specification alignment with task 4.1 API implementations and further work on APIs
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

See http://dev.webinos.org/redmine/projects/t3-4/wiki/API_specification_alignment_with_task_41_API_implementations

-   API owners allocated but still missing input for several APIs

-   Owner for Context - Dieter

-   Service Discovery API: Need to decide if we are going further with this API or if we should change the route to Web Intents.
    "Action Claes to initiate webinos Web Intents task force starting with phone meeting next week and with the ambition to make a final decision at the Ghent meeting. Participants: Nick, Andre, Alexander, Ziran, Habib, Dave, Dom, Christian, Victor":http://dev.webinos.org/redmine/issues/895

New APIs
--------

See http://dev.webinos.org/redmine/projects/t3-4/wiki/New_proposed_Webinos_APIs

Victor presented proposals for 2 new APIs:

-   "Privacy aware Location and Proximity API":http://dev.webinos.org/redmine/projects/t3-4/wiki/New_proposed_Webinos_APIs#Privacy-aware-Location-and-Proximity-API: The main motivation for providing this API in addition the the W3C Geolocation API is privacy, i.e. to give as little location information as possible. Issues raised where that it might overlap policy manager/privacy rules and that user proximity could instead be based on the user context. "Action Victor to elaborate more and provide examples on use cases for this API":http://dev.webinos.org/redmine/issues/896

-   "Tethering API":http://dev.webinos.org/redmine/projects/t3-4/wiki/New_proposed_Webinos_APIs#Tethering-API
    "Action Victor to elaborate more and provide examples on use cases for this API":http://dev.webinos.org/redmine/issues/897
