### Berlin Meeting

#### Preparation work for the Berlin Meeting

As announced in the previous phone conference and also in a mail to to WP3 list, the plan for covering 3.1 efficiently during the Berlin meeting is:

WP3 Meetings:
* Require (in advance of meeting) and update on status â€“ it should include:
# Progress made (with resources expended)
# Planned next steps (actions) + anticipated resources
# Decisions that need to be made â€“ and communicated

-   Update on status should be received (in advance of meeting) aim of meeting is to only discuss (3). - project management issues only should be raised if we have delayed actions â€“ and mostly dealt with offline .

A template for the points above has been provided on the Wiki at [[WP3 Berlin Meeting Preparation]].
Every work area needs to fill out the appropriate section in advance of the Berlin Meeting (by 29-APR-11).

Additional AP suggested by Nick: To aid planning of the project deliverable, every group also needs to provide a basic structure for their part of the deliverable.

A specific section for that has already been added to the Wiki.
