Runtime Authorisation and User Interfaces
-----------------------------------------

### Introduction

One aspect of security architectures which is often overlooked is the process of authorisation: obtaining consent from the user for a particular action. This involves logical processes as well as graphical user interfaces. This section does not provide precise implementation guidelines but specifies the data that will be presented to users during authorisation and gives examples. This work relates heavily to the [[Deliverable_introduction#Key-Design-Principles-for-Security-and-Privacy|design principles]].

This section of the deliverable primarily refers to _runtime user authorisation_: that is, it does not cover purely policy-dictated decisions or those based on certificates. in addition, identity management and log-in/log-out events are not covered here.

### Background

#### Requirements

The following security and privacy requirements from ([[Deliverable_References#Webinos-D22|Webinos-D22]]) are related to this part of the platform.

-   "PS-DEV-ambiesense-25":http://dev.webinos.org/redmine/projects/wp2-2/wiki/DeliverableVersionAll#PS-DEV-ambiesense-25 : The webinos runtime shall protect policies from tampering or modification by unauthorised applications. The only authorised applications shall be from signed, trusted sources, which may be defined by the manufacturer, network provider, or end user.
-   "PS-DEV-IBBT-004":http://dev.webinos.org/redmine/projects/wp2-2/wiki/DeliverableVersionAll#PS-DEV-IBBT-004 : A publish-subscribe system for event shall exist which requires authorisation for application subscriptions. webinos should provide a policy system regarding events.
-   "PS-USR-ISMB-036":http://dev.webinos.org/redmine/projects/wp2-2/wiki/DeliverableVersionAll#PS-USR-ISMB-036 : The webinos runtime shall support the download, install, update, and removal of security policies. These operations shall required authorisation by the user and policies must be checked for authenticity and integrity.
-   "PS-USR-Oxford-101":http://dev.webinos.org/redmine/projects/wp2-2/wiki/DeliverableVersionAll#PS-USR-Oxford-101 : The user should be able to allow detection of sensors/actuators only to authenticated and authorised entities and shall be able to prohibit detection.
-   "PS-USR-Oxford-103":http://dev.webinos.org/redmine/projects/wp2-2/wiki/DeliverableVersionAll#PS-USR-Oxford-103 : The webinos Runtime Environment shall only allow associations to be made between devices when predefined network security practices are followed, including transport level security, device authentication and user and device authorisation.
-   "PS-USR-Oxford-120":http://dev.webinos.org/redmine/projects/wp2-2/wiki/DeliverableVersionAll#PS-USR-Oxford-120 : A webinos Cloud shall determine the services a webinos Device is authorised to use before providing access to its services.
-   "PS-USR-Oxford-67":http://dev.webinos.org/redmine/projects/wp2-2/wiki/DeliverableVersionAll#PS-USR-Oxford-67 : webinos shall remove access to any additional authorisation credentials when a user logs out.
-   "NC-DWP-POLITO-007":http://dev.webinos.org/redmine/projects/wp2-2/wiki/DeliverableVersionAll#NC-DWP-POLITO-007 : The webinos runtime must be able to provide information to authorised applications about device physical features. Some examples are screen resolution and size, number of audio input/output channels, microphone availability, touch screen support, proximity.

Based on these requirements and the rest of the specification, authorisation is required for the following actions:

-   installation and execution of applications;
-   application actions, including:
    -   use, storage and disclosure of application data;
    -   use of device features;
    -   querying device specifications, including supported media formats and platform software state;
    -   use, storage and disclosure of contextual user data;
-   granting particular end users access to applications and services;
-   installation and use of policies;
-   the destination of webinos event messages (primarily devices and applications);
-   the installation and selection of signing authorities;
-   updating applications and policies; and
-   device and service discovery/detection.

The majority of these do not present any obvious challenges to the user, or are out of scope of this phase of webinos development (policy editing, selecting signing authorities). However, in the following section we identify several areas where some data is expected to be presented to the user.

We have not considered unauthorised copying and distribution of applications in this phase of the security architecture, as per "PS-DEV-ambiesense-02":http://dev.webinos.org/redmine/projects/wp2-2/wiki/DeliverableVersionAll#PS-DEV-ambiesense-02 .

### Threats and challenges

Authorisation is used to mitigate threats where entities (applications, users, devices) attempt to perform an undesirable action. The main challenges associated with runtime authorisation is usability: presenting users with enough information to make informed decisions at runtime (informed consent) while not overloading them with too many decisions. The result of requiring too many authorisation decisions is potentially to train users to always select the same "yes" or "no" response regardless of the situation.

Authorisation decisions may also be cached by the system, an example of which is the the "sudo" command in some UNIX operating systems. The caching of these decisions may result in undesired behaviour unless this is managed appropriately.

### Authorisation User Interfaces

#### Install-time authorisation

We do not specify the precise interface that must be implemented by the webinos runtime, as this may differ slightly on each platform. However, the following example demonstrates our expectations:

![]({width:600px}authorisation-install-app-webinos.jpg)

Note that the key difference between this example and that on Android is that fine-grained permissions can be granted or denied on a per-permission basis. Furthermore, each permission can state details about why it is requested and what will happen to the data given to the application.

#### Inter-device authorisation

Another place where authorisation will occur is when two devices in different personal zones attempt to use each othersâ€™ resources. This is discussed in the authentication section of Deliverable 3.1.

#### GUIs for authorising discovery and controlling identity

While not strictly just to do with authorisation, many requirements specify that users should be able to control whether their device is visible and discoverable to others. Similarly, users often assume that controls on location data are quickly available. The following interfaces demonstrate our expectations:

![](i-am-dropdown-logged-in.png)

The above example shows the interface presented to the end user when they are logged in and have made certain online identities available.

![](i-am-dropdown-anon-further-options.png)

The above example shows a more sophisticated interface presented to the user who wants to remain anonymous and turn off location and device discovery.

#### GUIs for identifying application data usage

Following the principle of "not obscuring actual information flow" ([[Deliverable_References#Lederer04|Lederer04]]), we have also considered our expectations of GUIs for showing application behaviour.

### Future directions

The proposed solutions still have many security and privacy issues. Firstly, it is unclear whether authorisation dialogues can provide sufficient information so that _informed consent_ is practical. If not, users will be forced to make decisions without the knowledge they need to make the right choice. This is fundamental to privacy and a major problem that webinos aims to avoid. It is expected that further modification to GUIs will be necessary to get this right.

Another common problem in security and usability is that runtime authorisation is used inappropriately. Often the runtime must make a decision about whether to trust another entity (a device, application, network) and this is pushed to the user who is not able to make a reasonable choice and will always chose the most convenient option. Runtime authorisation must occur infrequently and the user must be reasonably likely to chose to _not_ authorise a decision, otherwise it serves little purpose. To this end, we intend to try and take advantage of the related research in the PRIMMA project ([[Deliverable_References#PRiMMA|PRiMMA]]) investigating the use of the most appropriate notification system for user privacy decisions.
