Web Intents for webinos investigation
=====================================

Introduction
------------

Web Intents is a service discovery mechanism and light-weight RPC system between web applications, modeled after the similarly-named API in Android. Standardization is in progress and W3C runs a joint DAP WG / Web Applications WG task force. See "W3C Web Intents wiki":http://www.w3.org/wiki/WebIntents and "W3C Web Intents public mailing list archive":http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-web-intents/.

Google is the main driving player for Web Intents and is editor of the "W3C draft Web Intents specification":http://www.w3.org/TR/2012/WD-web-intents-20120626/. They also manage the "webintents.org site":http://webintents.org/ that contains use cases and examples of Web Intents Services. Native support for Web Intents is currently implemented in Chrome for desktop. However, Google’s plans for supporting Web Intents in Chrome for Android are currently unclear. Current public information only describes a project under Google Summer of Code 2012 for integrating Web Intents for Android Intents, see "WebIntents on Android":http://code.google.com/p/openintents/wiki/GSoC2012Ideas#WebIntents_on_Android. The project can be followed at github, "openintents / gsoc2012":https://github.com/openintents/gsoc2012.

Mozilla has also specified a similar concept called "Web Activities":https://wiki.mozilla.org/WebAPI/WebActivities and "Web Activities: counter-proposal to Web Intents":http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-web-intents/2012Jun/0061.html.

W3C is driving Web Intents as the standard for web based service discovery and it is important to align webinos with Web Intents. However, the concept is still not established enough for webinos to make a complete shift to a Web Intents based architecture. Standardization is in progress and the only existing browser native implementation is Google Chrome for desktop. We do not yet know how the final standard will look like. An example is Ian Hickson’s proposal for merging the W3C/Google and Mozilla concepts. See "[whatwg] register*Handler and Web Intents":http://lists.whatwg.org/htdig.cgi/whatwg-whatwg.org/2012-July/036719.html.

So far webinos activities on Web Intents have been to impact the development of the standard in W3C. The webinos project is active in the W3C Web Intents task force through several partners, Sony, W3C and Telecom Institute Paris. One example is Sony’s submission of the "Web Intents Addendum - Local Services":http://w3c-test.org/dap/wi-addendum-local-services/ specification to support discovery and use of Services on Web Intents enabled devices in local wifi networks.

This section of the task 3.4 delivery report provides basic information on Web Intents and gives a high level suggestion for aligning webinos with Web Intents, i.e. making webinos Services discoverable for Web Intents enabled web applications.

Web Intents standardization overview
------------------------------------

### Web Intents basics

The "W3C Web Intents specification":http://www.w3.org/TR/web-intents/ is currently a working draft. All three editors are from Google.

The basic Web Intents concepts are:

-   An **Intent** is an action to be performed by a Service and is defined by:
    -   **Action**: a URI defining what to do (share, pick, view, etc)
    -   **Type**: the data type to perform the action on (image, url, json etc)

-   A **Client** web app requests an Intent be handled, the User Agent allows the user to select which Service to use, and the Service performs the action of the Intent, possibly using data passed as input in the Intent.
    -   Client Web Apps requests an action to be performed by creating an Intent and issuing â€startActivityâ€.

-   A **Service** is normally implemented as a web application. It lists the Intents it can handle and executes the action of the intent. A Service is defined by:
    -   Action it can handle.
    -   Type it can handle.
    -   A Service may return data as output to the Client

-   Services must be registered prior to being available for Client web apps to use and there are several ways to register Web Intents Services, for example:
    -   Markup, the <intent> tag, is used by web pages that register Services. A Web page can register itself or another same domain web page as the Service handler.
    -   For the Chrome Web Intents implementation Services are registered through the "Chrome manifest file":http://code.google.com/chrome/extensions/manifest.html#intents
    -   Dynamic Service registration based on local network service discovery is also specified according to "Web Intents Addendum - Local Services":http://w3c-test.org/dap/wi-addendum-local-services/. See the section below on local network service discovery.
    -   Registration/Unregistration through a JS API is also proposed.

### Web Intents based APIs

Web Applications can use Web Intents as a general service discovery mechanism and Web Intents based APIs can be used to interact with the service. However, there is still much to do in standardizing Web Intents based APIs. Currently there are following W3C drafts:

-   "Pick Media Intent":http://w3c-test.org/dap/gallery/ (Web Intents based Gallery API)

-   "Pick Contacts Intent":http://w3c-test.org/dap/contacts/ (Web Intents based Contacts API)

In addition the following pages deal with interaction patterns between Client and Service applications but they don’t specify tangible APIs:

-   "webintents.org":http://webintents.org/ Contains a list of intents that Google believes the majority of applications and services will use and data formats for interaction between Clients and Services. However, the level of detail is not enough for providing full interoperability between Clients and Services.

-   "Web Intents payload data format for MIME types":http://www.w3.org/wiki/WebIntents/MIME_Types: Proposes payload data format clients must use, and services can expect, when using MIME type specifiers.

-   "Web Intents payload data format for schema.org types":http://www.w3.org/wiki/WebIntents/schema.org_Types: Proposes payload data format clients must use, and services can expect, when using schema.org types are used.

Note that some Web Intents use cases require simple RPC APIs and some use cases require APIs supporting a longer lasting relation between the Client application and the Service application.

-   RPC APIs: Client sends payload data to the Service with intents attributes and Service returns data with the intents invocation method callback function. The W3C "Pick Media Intent":http://w3c-test.org/dap/gallery/ API and "Pick Contacts Intent":http://w3c-test.org/dap/contacts/ are examples of RPC-based APIs.

-   Message channel based APIs/protocols: Web Intents allows a longer lasting relation between the Client and the Service by using an HTML message channel. On top of this message channel a high level protocols can run. For an example of the case when an HTML message channel between the Client and Service pages is used to run a high level protocol see slide 18 in the presentation "W3C Web Intents - Local Network Service Discovery":http://www.w3.org/wiki/images/2/2e/V4_W3C_Web_Intents_-_Local_UPnP_Service_Discovery.pdf. Here a high level "TV Control Protocol", independent of low level communication (for example UPnP) method and details, is used by the Client web application.
    
    When comparing Web Intents with the "webinos Service Discovery API":http://dev.webinos.org/specifications/new/servicediscovery.html we see that one advantage with the webinos API is that existing standard or webinos JavaScript APIs are used to interact with the discovered and selected Service. For Web Intents there is still much to be done in defining the APIs/protocols to use between Clients and Services.
    
    h3. Web Intents for local network service discovery
    
    Web Intents is a general Service Discovery concept and Services, capable of executing the requested Action, could be located "anywhere". This means that Web Intents Services are not only static registered web services but that they could also be dynamically discovered local services, e.g. services on UPnP enabled devices in local wifi networks or services in devices that are locally connected through Bluetooth or any other short range communication method. These dynamic Services may or may not have a UI.
    
    To support discovery and usage of Web Intents Services on local network devices Sony has provided the "Web Intents Addendum- Local Services":http://w3c-test.org/dap/wi-addendum-local-services/ specification that defines how Services on Web Intents enabled UPnP and mDNS devices can be discovered and accessed. There is also a demo and a presentation, see "WebIntents/SonyMobile - Local Network Service Discovery":http://www.w3.org/wiki/WebIntents/SonyMobile_-_Local_Network_Service_Discovery. The basic idea with this proposal is that UPnP and other common low level service discovery mechanisms should be supported by the UA and that this will be utilized by the UA’s Web Intents implementation to discover and dynamically register local network services.
    
    The "W3C WebIntents/Home Discovery and Web Intents":http://www.w3.org/wiki/WebIntents/Home_Discovery_and_Web_Intents also lists different use cases and solution proposals for "Home discovery" with Web Intents.
    
    In addition Opera and CableLabs have submitted an unofficial draft of an API for discovery and access to local network services that is not based on Web Intents, "Networked Service Discovery and Messaging":http://people.opera.com/richt/release/specs/discovery/Overview.html.
    
    h3. Web Intents and Sensor use cases
    
    It is proposed to use Web Intents as a service discovery mechanism for sensors and that a generic sensor API will be layered on top of Web Intents. This work has not yet progressed in W3C so far but it is important that webinos get involved as well.

    h2. Aligning webinos with Web Intents
    
    h3. Goal
    
    The goal for aligning webinos with Web Intents is to allow web application to discover and use standard Web Intents Services residing "anywhere" in the cloud or in the local network as well as Web Intents enabled webinos Services.
    
    h3. Where does the User Agent Web Intents implementation reside?
    
    Currently support for the Web Intents APIs are implemented in the browser, either through a native implementation as in Chrome, or through a JavaScript shim that is included in Client and Service web pages. The list of registered Services is stored in local memory in the device in which the browser is running. This model is not perfect for a cross-device concept as webinos as user’s should be able to register Services that are accessible from the user’s all devices.
    
    A proposal has been raised by a webinos partner in W3C on separating a Web Intents Agent (WIA) from the User Agent and allowing this WIA be implemented in another entity than the browser, for example the PZP. The thread starts here: http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-web-intents/2012Jun/0024.html.
    
    For webinos there are several possibilities, for example:
    1. Reuse the browsers native Web Intents implementation. Currently only Google Chrome for desktop provides native support for Web Intents but it is expected that other browsers will follow. This would mean that users will experience a UI for webinos Web Intents Services that is consistent with any other Web Intents Services but will limit the possibilities for webinos to what is provided by the browser implementation and APIs.
    
    2. De-couple the Web Intents implementation from the browser or widget runtime and create a webinos implementation of the "Web Intents Agent" in the PZP. This would make webinos support for Web Intents independent of browsers and widget engines used and also easier to provide a repository of registered Web Intents Services that can be shared among the different devices in a user’s personal zone. This repository could for example be located in the PZH. However, privacy issues, for example the feature that Client and Service web applications are anonymous to each other, must be considered.
    
    3. Implement support for Web Intents for webinos, or parts of Web Intents, by using browser extension capabilities. The "Chrome socket API extension":http://developer.chrome.com/trunk/apps/app_network.html could for example be used to implement support the Web Intents addendum for local network services through the ability to get access to UDP.
    
    h3. Registration of Webinos Web Intents Services
    
    The W3C Web Intents specification defines Service registration markup with the <intent> tag, http://www.w3.org/TR/web-intents/#registration-markup. Web pages can register themselves as Service handlers or other same-origin pages as Service handlers. However, this Service registration method is currently not implemented in Chrome. Instead Chrome Web Intents Services must be registered in the Chrome manifest file manifest.json, http://developer.chrome.com/extensions/manifest.html#intents.
    
    There is also ongoing discussions on adding a JS API for registration and unregistration.
    
    In addition dynamic registration of Web Intents Services on locally discovered UPnP and mDNS devices are specified in "Web Intents Addendum- Local Services":http://w3c-test.org/dap/wi-addendum-local-services/. Here a "Web Intents document" retrieved from the discovered UPnP or mDNS device contains the registration markup.

For webinos it seems reasonable to declare a Service to be Web Intents enabled in the manifest file. This file could for example contain a link to an html page that contains registration markup or JS for registration. Compare with the "Web Intents document" for UPnP and mDNS devices as described in the "W3C Web Intents Addendum - Local Services":http://w3c-test.org/dap/wi-addendum-local-services/, section 4.1.3.

It should be considered if there should be two states in the registration process:

1.  Discovered but unregistered Services are stated as â€œsuggested Servicesâ€ in the Web Intents Service picker.
2.  When the user explicitly has approved, in the Service picker, when configuring the system or in any other situation, to use a suggested Service it is moved to the list of â€œselectable Servicesâ€.

The Chrome Web Intents implementation works similar to above.

### Service invocation

When a web application invokes an Intent through startActivity () and the Web Intents Service picker is visible in the User Agent the suggested and selectable Services that are able to handle the Action and Type of the Intent is displayed in the Service picker.

Invoking a webinos Web Intents Service is basically done in the same way as for any other Web Intents Services the webinos access control framework will control allow or deny access based on Client web application origin, Service identity and policy settings.

### Interaction between webinos applications and webinos Web Intents Services

The section "Web Intents based APIs":http://dev.webinos.org/redmine/projects/t3-4/wiki/Web_Intents_for_Webinos_investigation#Web-Intents-based-APIs describes the situation on Web Intents based APIs. So far W3C has only specified RPC like Web Intents based APIs. However, use cases that require a long lasting relation between the Client application and Service are common. For example, running a web application that controls video playback on a remote TV device or running a web application continuously using data from sensors on a remote device. So we need:

1. Specified high level protocols that run on top of an html message channel running between the Client and Service web applications.

2. The ability to run a Service application in the background, i.e. hidden with no UI, as many use cases require that the UA continues to show the Client Web Application after the Service has been selected.

For 1 one idea could be to facilitate for application developers by creating JS libraries of simple methods on top of the message channel protocol used to interact with the Service. This would make it possible to reuse existing JS APIs and use them to access Services selected through Web Intents. For example, the user has a Web Intents enabled UPnP device, providing a remote video view Service, The Client web application communicates with the Service handler page through a high level â€œvideo viewâ€ protocol (â€œPlayâ€, â€œStopâ€, â€œPauseâ€, â€œResumeâ€, etc). A JS library could then be included by the Client web application and this library could have JS methods for Playâ€, â€œStopâ€, â€œPauseâ€, â€œResumeâ€, etc.

For 2 the "W3C Web Intents specification":http://www.w3.org/TR/web-intents/ does currently not allow "hidden" Services. Only Service disposition with a new browser window or disposition inline the Service picker is allowed. Google’s motivation for not allowing disposition "hidden" is that running Services in the background with no UI would be a security issue. However, there is an action on Sony to propose how disposition "hidden" could be provided in a secure manner.

### Security and privacy comparison

The existing webinos discovery API and Web Intents have different security and privacy models which would need to be aligned more closely. Web Intents define the following access control points:

-   _Registration_ - The decision to register an intent service as ‘selectable’.
-   _User consent_ - The user’s consent is granted when they make the decision to select a particular intent service at runtime.
-   _Authenticating users and services_ - The standard web model is followed. An intent service may require user authentication and services may be offered through HTTPS sessions.

In comparison, the webinos discovery system relies on:

-   _Registration_ - Each device offering a service must be explicitly connected to a personal zone before it can be accessed. This is either through enrolment (when adding a new device belonging to the user) or through certificate exchange (when connecting to a device outside the personal zone).
-   _User consent_ - The policy system is used to authorise application installation and api invocation. Policies can be set when an application is installed or can be modified subsequently. Policies can change based on the user’s environment, such as whether they are roaming or on a local wifi network. A policy might require user consent once, every time or never.
-   _Authenticating users and services_ - The personal zone overlay network is relied upon to mutually authenticate services to users.

These are similar but with key differences. Firstly, registration in webinos is a more time-consuming process and is most suited to creating personal networks rather than registering arbitrary services. This allows authentication to be mutual and (arguably) stronger, but imposes a higher overhead. Secondly, the consent model in webinos is more flexible but also more complicated. Thirdly, In Web Intents, the consent process is combined with a service selection process, which could be considered an advantage in usability. However, this fails to satisfy use cases where the application needs to maintain some control over the services selected (e.g., specifying that they all belong to the same device) or where the application wants to save the user’s choice of service provider. Finally, the discovery approach in webinos is currently vulnerable to _fingerprinting_ attacks, allowing users to be tracked between different web applications. Web Intents, in comparison, are potentially more privacy-preserving as they explicitly don’t allow the enumeration of potential intent service providers.

To align the two models would require the following changes:

-   webinos would need to have altered policy settings which referred to the intent service selection process. E.g., a policy would need to answer the question: can application X invoke the ‘share’ intent? In this case, the possible policy settings might be:
    -   "yes, show intent selection prompt each time",
    -   "yes, show intent selection prompt the first time",
    -   "yes, always use intent provider Y"
    -   "no"
-   These settings would not make webinos incompatible with web intents, and would _still_ support flexible use-cases based on user environment information.
-   webinos would either need to stop supporting applications which require visibility of all services available in a personal zone, or support both web intents _and_ the discovery API. These would need to be made compatible at the API level.
-   webinos services are generally more trusted than arbitrary intent service providers. They are hosted on known devices and are likely to store data in well-known places. They use a standard authentication process which is arguably more trustworthy. Furthermore, the privacy implications of using a service provided by a personal zone device are likely to be understood. Online web intent services, on the other hand, may authenticate users differently (or not at all) and may provide no transport security. As such, presenting both webinos services and web intent services to the user as equal options during intent service selection might be misleading. Work would need to be done to identify the best way of presenting personal zone services and web services differently to users.

### Web Intents versus webinos AppLauncher API

A question was raised whether Web Intents could be used as an application launcher mechanism.

The general answer is yes in the context of one web application launching another web application of a certain type. However, comparing with the "webinos AppLauncher module":http://dev.webinos.org/specifications/draft/launcher.html there are signficant differences.

webinos AppLauncher module:
* Provides two methods:
**** Launch a webinos application that is installed on the same device. The application to launch can be either webinos native or an installed webinos application and is identified by a unique application identity.
**** Check if a webinos application, identified by a unique application identity, is installed on the device.
* The operation of the API is guided by application execution policies, which can be modified by user.

Web Intents:
* Allows a web application to launch another "Service" web application identified by the action the Service performs and a type. For example pick an image (action="Pick", type="image/*") or view a video (action="View", type="video/*"). The User Agent allows the user to choose the Service application to use among a list of registered Services that are capable of handling this action and type. There is also a possibility for a Client application to point out a unique Service web application that should be launched, see "Explicit Intents":http://dvcs.w3.org/hg/web-intents/raw-file/tip/spec/Overview.html#explicit-intents.
* The Service executing the Intent does not have to be installed in the device, it can reside anywhere.
* The Client web application requesting the action to be performed and the executing Service web application are annonymous to each other if not an explicit Service is stated when the Client invokes the Intent.
* The security model is based on user consent when selecting a Service to use for the requested Action. Operation is not guided by any pre-configured application execution policies. However, a Web Intents enabled Service can of course implement any standard web security mechanisms as needed, e.g.login with user credentials or transport layer security.
* There is currently no explicit method to check the availability of a certain Service application and expose this information to the requesting Client web application (and I don’t think it should due to privacy/fingerprinting reasons). However, the specification opens up for applications to provide a user controlled check of registered Services. According to the Web Intents specification, section 4, 2nd paragrah:

> The User Agent must not allow web pages the ability to discover passively which services the user has configured to handle particular intents, or any intents, whether by enumeration or exact query. There may be mechanisms for the user to actively grant this information to web pages, but it must not be made available passively.

So, it should be possible to provide a method, that is governed by webinos security policies, to check registered Web Intents Services.

The conclusion is that Web Intents is a more general concept than webinos application launching but it should be possible to use Web Intents as an application launcher mechanism in the webinos context.
