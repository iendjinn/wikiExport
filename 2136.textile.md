Notes:
------

Some requirements could be satisfied by some restrictive hypothesis.

1.  **Attestation API** is currently considered deprecated in T3.4
2.  **Addressable applications**
    instances of applications are identifiable using PZH_name/PZP_name/random_number. However, presently this functionality is not accessible through a documented API (According to mail to WP4 of 23 of MArch from Andre Paul, it seems possible to access
    through eventAPIToUse.myAppID or webinos.messageHandler.getOwnId(), However, not an API but respectively an attribute and a core webinos method.
    Furthermore, this addresses instances, and from that it is not possible to understand what application really is, without some other information.
3.  **Application identity**
    If some method would exist to derive identity from address (and vice-versa) the thoughts from previous point applies here. However, it’s worth to remark that address and identity are different concepts (even if overlaps in some cases).
4.  **Component address**
    Component definition is a little vague. For PZP we have the string PZH_name/PZP_name/ (see previous points). However, this restricts to PZH, PZP and (instance of ) applications only.
5.  **Component attestation**
     The (no longer valid) attestation API provides only platform attestation, not "component" attestation
6.  **Device identity**
     if we consider device coincident to the PZP, and we can retrieve it in the sense of PZP name (not through and API, but through the string PZH_name/PZP_name/)
7.  **Identity communication**
    If identity=address, it is sent and received in any message exchange. In contrary case, the information is not available.
8.  **Remote device identity**
    Same discussion as above in the device identity. This could be complicated by the fact that this scenario is inter-zone. In theory, since there is the PZH_name in the string it should work as in the intra-zone device identity.
9.  **Mutual authentication**
    It’s realized at device level (after the enrollment) between PZH and PZP thanks to TLS security exchange (nothing to do with any API).

Review
------

[John] - This mapping looks good.
