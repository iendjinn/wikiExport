User ID and Data Management - Phase II
======================================

The content of this site is all relevant for specifying phase II. It must be considered there.

### 1 - Installation of PZP on the device

The PZP is a fundamental and trusted component of a personal zone. For proper security of the entire personal zone, we must address the issue of how does the PZP get installed upon the device.

The stricken out text is old and not suitable for the deliverable. However it provides good hints for what to consider when further flashing out details in phase II. It is to be moved for further use. Where to? (Sven Lachmund)

-The ideal principles of this process should be:-

-   -After installation a unique devices identifier and a unique PZP identifiers, should be cached on the PZH-
-   -The device identifier should be hard to spoof at time of installation-
-   -Some level of checking on the underlying OS, should be done before installation, to ensure compatibility (and safety?)-
-   -After point of installation, it should be possible for the PZH to attest to the integrity of the PZP-
-   -All PZH <-> PZP sessions which are establsihed post intstall should carry some derivative of the PZP <-> device binding-

### 2 - identifiers for local discovery

For the local discovery problem, we may need to define an algorithm that defines sets of identifier, to preserve some level of anonymity

### 3 - Extra webinos authentication

<span class="rev">AndrÃ©: If this section does not contain Phase 1 specification (why not btw?) why is it in here? At least i would remove the three UML sequence diagrams because its confusing in case its not further specified in phase 1. No SSO in webinos for the time being?</span>

In Webinos Phase I, intra and inter zones authentication and SSO features has been detailed. However, webinos Phase II will implement SSO features also toward webinos unaware services. PZH and PZP are candidate entity to achieve SSO on behalf of the user. This point will be further investigated in Phase II, here follows the candidate plan.

PZH is the central repository of all the valid credentials of the system. Ideally, it has the necessary credentials to identify and authenticate to each service user can connect. When required (e.g. in strictly controlled environments) PZH can be the mediator of the connection to all external (i.e. non in-zone) service.

It will support multiple identification and authentication mechanisms, from direct client-server exchange (e.g. exchange of username+password on TLS protectected channel for access to bank account), to multi-step authentications which involve third party Identity Providers (against who authentication is performed and a specific service authentication token is sent back, e.g. in the form of SAML exchange). Possibly, when required, also authorization to third party protocols (e.g. OAuth) can be experimented (e.g. to use facebook account for access to webinos services)

The following sequence diagrams details what will be the required behavior in different scenarios

Ideally, on the base of the kind of authentication/authorization protocol adopted by the service (mainly SAML-based or OAuth based) the PZP/PZH will be able to accomplish the authentication process. In principle, this can be transparent from the user perspective (but policies adopted by the specific personal zone can supersede transparency for sake of security, e.g. requiring a new user credential verification during the authentication process).

Applications can query and request authentication and connection service through PZH, thanks to the "authentication API":http://dev.webinos.org/specifications/draft/authentication.html

### 4 - Information about TLS sessions accessible by the app

The whole story is not as simple as it is presented in [[t3-5:Deliverable_Specifications_Session_Security|Session Security (D3.5)]]. True, we want to do the session amanagement on the transport layer using TLS. This allows the app developer to rely on authentication, confidentiality and integrity provided by webinos. This is good, no doubt. However, app developers need the sessions to distinguish them and to assign them and the messages they receive via the network to distinct users. If apps handle their own sessions, this is easy. However, if the layer below does that fully transparently, how does the app developer know which packet (HTTP, XMPP, …) came via which TLS connection from which peer? I (Sven) believe that current TLS implementations are not as transparent as I always want to make you believe. There is instead of a TCPSocket object a TLSSocket object in the code which also allows access to the connection state and to the certificate of the peer. The certificate contains the identifier of the peer and here we go. But we have to see how this is implemented in detail. We have to decide how to cope with this issue, as reviewers may complain that we have a too simple and unrealistic assumption of the world. But we’ll tumble over that during implementation anyhow!

What we need to solve is:
* How does the app distinguish connections (sockets?) between different apps on the same hosts?
* How do we access information about the TLS connection on the UA side (i.e. in the browser)?
* We need to provide a JavaScript API offering this information to the Web app developer!

Here is some further insight into this topic: on the server side, it is not a problem to access the TLS information at all. The example code below shows how to access it in PHP when using an Apache HTTP server. As the example shows, the app developer can refrain from using a connection if it is not considered secure and the developer can access the identifier of the device and the PZH.

if($_SERVER[‘HTTPS’] != ‘on’)

 if ($_SERVER[‘SSL_CIPHER_ALGKEYSIZE’] >= 128)
 {
 echo("Cipher is >= 128 bit: ".$_SERVER[‘SSL_CIPHER_ALGKEYSIZE’].". That is good!<br>");
 echo("Let’s start communicating with ".$_SERVER[‘SSL_SERVER_S_DN_CN’].". This is either the
 ID of the device or, in the case of the PZH, the unique URI of the PZH.<br>");
 echo("The personal zone is identified by the issuer certificate, which comes from the PZH: "
 .$_SERVER[‘SSL_SERVER_I_DN_CN’].".<br>");
 } else {
 echo("Cipher size is < 128 bit: ".$_SERVER[‘SSL_CIPHER_ALGKEYSIZE’].". That is really bad!<br>");
 }

The output of this fancy program on a webinos device that uses SSL is:

SSL is being used at present.

SSL Protocol: TLSv1
SSL Cipher: DHE-RSA-CAMELLIA256-SHA
SSL Validity start: Jul 1 12:49:53 2011 GMT

SSL Session ID: 4F8B4E52DDDEC24883AE03D2532E0FC8894C67C0B300CC48AC4E1FCA4A11D4D9

Validation

Cipher is >= 128 bit: 256. That is good!
Let’s start communicating with Alice’s MP3 Player. This is either the ID of the device or, in the case of the PZH, the unique URI of the PZH.
The personal zone is identified by the issuer certificate, which comes from the PZH: pzh://alice.pzh.myzone.net.
