Agenda

Intro Nick
----------

Went through introduction slide.

31 Reports

User ID (Nick)
--------------

Andrea: other area of interaction - device service discovery

Andrea: request for review by 16/3/11 - on basis of ppt presentation
Sven: common representation of identifier for users/apps/deices/services required - co-ordiante with discovery
- specific example - how do we find other usersâ€™ devices? Do we identify users first and then look-up their devices and set-up communication with a device?.
Ziran: answer to Svenâ€™s question dependent on the initial architecture - would like to review response after the draft architecture.

Context (GeorgeG)
-----------------

George question: should state of art cover just eu research of global: conclusion global
Nick: action revise over-aching draft architecture. proposal to annotate with context relevant sub areas
George: there is the risk of missing stuff in the process. so timing is important…
George: 1) plan state of art… then 2) add context structures….

Policy (Davide/Salvatore)
-------------------------

http://dev.webinos.org/redmine/projects/wp3-1/wiki/Policy_Management
Action: to chase down remaining parties for resourcing….

Discovery (Ziran)
-----------------

Nick and Dave will get back to Ziran on precise timing
Proposal: for all state of the art analysis to follow a similar structure and stand alone as a userul paper in its own right.
Airan proposes to follow up 1:1 with each area
Andre: is service discovery same as service discovery - ie javascript - as per 3.2
Claes:
Andres: how does service discovery contrast to 3.2 device api.
George: ertis and context identified in first item - aign wiht exictatins
Ziran->GeorgeG: Context management should take care in providing a mechanism for identifying/retriving/allowing access to the propertis to be used in Discovery
Hans: can we do a common sequence diagram representations…
Ziran: makese sense: shall we do in state of art… Can each owner or state of the art document their sequence flows.
Hans: distinguis between discovery of applications and services
Claes: SEMCA proposal contains this distinction. Webinos application utilise â€œservicesâ€
Action: Ziran to review Claesâ€™s proposal - and capture is an issue to be resolved
Claes: is there a template for landscape
Ziran: takes action to produce a template

Web App (Andre)
---------------

Nick: suggestion to engage â€œexternal expertsâ€ e.g Marcos and Robin - to help shape/test v2 widget specification..
background info: Widgets 2.0 Use Cases and Requirements: http://www.w3.org/2008/webapps/wiki/Widgets2_UC%26R
Need to chase resources: from Impleo and W3C

Privileged (Krishna)
--------------------

Krishna: some consierabel work to be done filling in concrete use cases - which are nto ye covered in WP2.1
Nick: clarifying the unis - are they weeks or months: ANSWER : weeks
ACTION Nick to reconcile reporting units with all parties.

Analytics (None)
----------------

Action: Stephan and Nick to discuss plan

Event Handling (Stefano/Marco)
------------------------------

ACTION: please review http://dev.webinos.org/redmine/attachments/410/comm_draft_1.pdf by 16/3/11 and send feedback back to lea
ACTION: ISMB to chase resourcing on missing areas
Nick: need to bare in mind distinction between implementation architectreh an specificaiton architecture

Browser (Simon)
---------------

Question Nick: is plugin repository similar to discovery
Simon: yes - but there is extra infomration not covered there - more similar to firefox plugin repository.
Nick: when do we do the alignment for the other groups
Simon: functional requirement analysis first (mid next week)

Overlay Network (Dave)
----------------------

I have to leave at 10am UTC but here are my slides:

* overlay slides see also wiki page

The overlay work cuts across the other subgroups e.g. authentication, context, discovery and extensions. The first priority is the extension mechanism, followed by discovery and device drivers, and in parallel clarifying the role of context (personal zones) as a means to support the overlay model.
Dave: outline the what and why, and short term steps
Sets the expectation that the overlay project - maps over many of the subtopics….

3.2 update Claes
----------------

Review of companies who have committed to already identified apis
HW: recommend that TIM take - Steffano -action to check internally and get back to claes
App data: Fraunhofer leasd SEMC support
Comms: SEMC to lead
App execution API: visionmobile to check by friday, Impleo to contribute (Fraunhofer might also be able to contribute)
Discovery APIs: Samsung to lead
Security and Privacy: Oxford (nick to check with andrew)
User and App data APIs: DT to contribute, Docomo to contribute
Overlay: W3C proposed (to check)-

ISMB - volunteer and contributors and reviewers.
