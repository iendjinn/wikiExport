Personal Zone Key Infrastructure - new proposal
===============================================

This proposal is based on several things.

1.  the existing PKI documentation: http://dev.webinos.org/redmine/projects/wp3-3/wiki/Personal_Zone_Key_Infrastructure
2.  the following change request: http://dev.webinos.org/redmine/projects/wp2-4/wiki/Personal_Zone_Unlinkability
3.  the desire to eventually support more peer-to-peer personal zone enrolment
4.  the desire to potentially support device-specific encryption (e.g. for webinos services)

New certificate and key hierarchy
---------------------------------

### PZH CA keys and certificates

The PZH will have multiple CA certificates and keys. Each CA certificate may correspond to an OpenID identity. E.g., Alice Smith who is hosting her PZH at hubfarm.com might have the following hub CA certificates :

  ----------------- ---------- ----------------------------- ----------------------------
  OpenID            Key        Certificate common name       Certificate email address
  alice@foo.com     CA Key 1   Pzh:hubfarm:alice@foo.com     alice@foo.com
  a.smith@bar.com   CA Key 2   Pzh:hubfarm:a.smith@bar.com   a.smith@bar.com
  [none]            CA Key 3   Pzh:hubfarm:[random string]   [randomstring]@hubfarm.com
  ----------------- ---------- ----------------------------- ----------------------------

### PZH keys and certificates

The PZH will have several other keys and certificates, in the following categories:

  ------------------ --------------------------------------------------- ---------------------------------- -- ------------------ --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- -- ---------------- ---------------------------- ------------------------------------------------------------
  Key                Use                                                 Certificate
  TLS (client) key   Client key for outgoing connections to other PZHs   Signed by one of the PZH CA keys
  CRL key            Signing CRLs for the revocation of PZPs             Signed by one of the PZH CA keys
  ------------------ --------------------------------------------------- ---------------------------------- -- ------------------ --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- -- ---------------- ---------------------------- ------------------------------------------------------------

Every key with a certificate issued by a PZH CA must be duplicated for each CA key that exists.

Incoming TLS connections to a PZH Farm can be handled by SNI, such that the client requests the particular identity it is looking for. In this situation, the identity ought to be the user OpenID identity.

### PZP keys and certificates

Each PZP will have the following keys and certificates:

  ------------------------ ------------------------------------------------------------------- ----------------------------------
  Key                      Use                                                                 Certificate
  PZP CA key               Creating certificates for other keys. Root identity for this key.   Signed by one of the PZH CA keys
  PZP TLS client key       Client key for connecting to the PZH and other PZPs                 Signed by one of the PZP CA keys
  PZP encryption key       Key that may be used to decrypt incoming data                       Signed by one of the PZP CA keys
  PZP WebSocket key        Key used as a server to the WebSocket connection from the browser   Signed by one of the PZP CA keys
  PZP Browser client key   Key used to identify the browser to the WebSocket connection.       Signed by one of the PZP CA keys
  ------------------------ ------------------------------------------------------------------- ----------------------------------

For each PZH CA key and certificate, there ought to be a new PZP CA _certificate_ at the very least. It can be argued that there would need to be multiple keys, too.

### With one identity and two PZPs

This diagram does not show the multiplicity of keys or certificates for different identities.
