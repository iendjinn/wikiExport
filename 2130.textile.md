Payment API
-----------

### Overview of API

http://dev.webinos.org/specifications/new/payment.html

"This API provides generic shopping basket functionality to provide in-app payment. It is not linked to a specific payment service provider and is designed to be sufficiently generic to be mapable to various payment services like GSMA OneAPI, BlueVia, Android Payment API or PayPal."

### Threats

#### API-Specific threats and misuse cases

-   An application could add items to the shopping basket with user consent. This could result in the user being charged more money or purchasing something they didn’t mean to.
-   An application could remove items from the shopping basket without user consent. This would be irritating, and might put them off using this application or payment provider.
-   An application could modify the item price, making it cost more for the end user. Alternatively, it could mean that the user thinks something is cheap. Or it could defraud the merchant.
-   An application could fail to update the basket after a change, resulting in an incorrect total amount being displayed.
-   An application could accidentally double-add items to the basket
-   An application could use an inappropriate out-of-band authenticator with the payment provider, resulting in unauthorised payment
-   The payment provider might use SMS-based authentication, which webinos could intercept and allow an attacker who has stolen one device to buy lots of things.
-   The invocation of the API may be logged by the context DB. This might mean that a item purchased privately or semi-anonymously is then recorded in the user’s personal history. This could cause embarrassment.
-   An application might create and load a shopping basket without user consent.
-   The process of authenticating might reveal user contact details or address information.
-   The API could accidentally link payments through different mechanisms (e.g. PayPal and Visa) which would otherwise be anonymous.
-   A child might misuse an app with access to the payment API - e.g. downloading pay-per-view content.

#### Threats based on remote invocation of this API from another device

-   The API could be invoked remotely on another device owned by the user, resulting in the payment provider’s authentication mechanism appearing on the wrong device. This could either be misused to trick the user into purchasing the wrong thing, or make it impossible for the user to properly authenticate.
-   The API could be invoked on someone else’s device, taking advantage of any credentials they have for authenticating to the payment provider.
-   If the webinos web/widget runtime allowed unauthorised cross-origin communication, then the App might be able to eavesdrop or intercept key presses / input from the user during payment authentication.

#### Implementation threats and possible attacks

#### Threats to apps and developers using this API (E.g. Jimmy and Jessica)

-   A failure of the payment API could result in the app developer missing out on revenue. E.g., the payment API does not work, or results in difficult to use behaviour, resulting in the user cancelling the payment.
-   Misuse of the payment API might result in the developer appearing fraudulent.

#### Threats to device manufacturers, operators, other stakeholders

-   Misuse of the payment API would cause bad publicity for any operator or manufacturer using/shipping webinos on their handsets.

#### Further considerations

-   The payment provider’s authentication mechanism may be fundamentally flawed, or make assumptions that do not hold in webinos.
-   Payment doesn’t fundamentally introduce anything new in webinos compared to the browser.

### Mitigations

-   Remove from webinos? Doesn’t add any innovation, does add complexity and an attack vector?
-   Do not allow remote invocation
-   Require user consent and authentication before invoking the checkout operation. However, this ought to be provided by the service rather than necessarily by the policy framework.
-   Recommend that a custom analysis on each payment provider is performed, to check that webinos is not introducing new attack vectors.

Applications will be granted access to this API without user consent being required. This can only be modified using a policy editor.
                                         Default allow (install time)        Widgets will need user consent at install time, but users will expect to allow it (the tick-box will automatically be filled in).                        Web pages will prompt for consent (Yes / No / Always) at runtime, this preference will be saved.
                                         Default ask at runtime (one-shot)   Widgets will require one-off user consent at runtime. This fact will be visible & modifiable at install time.                                            Web pages will prompt for consent (Yes / No / Always) at runtime, this preference will be saved.                                          Default ask at runtime (every time)   Widgets will require user consent at runtime, every time. This fact will be visible & modifiable at install time.
                                         Default deny (install time)         Widgets will require user consent at install time, but users will expect NOT to allow it (the tick-box will automatically be empty).                     Web pages will display a short notification at first-use saying that access was denied, with a button to change settings
                                         Silently deny                       2. Applications will not be granted access to this API, and users will not be asked at install time. This can only be modified using a policy editor.

Rationale: the payment API does not introduce anything new compared to regular browser payment.
