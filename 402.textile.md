Messaging
---------

By messaging in Webinos we mean all signalling (notifications, data, queries, context changes, capabilities, service discovery, etc.) that is needed for Webinos and Webinos applications to operate.

Messaging in Webinos roughly falls apart into 3 different categories.
# Messages and notifications needed for management of the Webinos cloud.
# Messages and notifications about changes in the personal Webinos that are of interest for applications.
# Messages and notifications originated from applications that can be reused by other applications.
# Messages and notifications originated from applications meant for entities that are not managed by Webinos.

Although the last category of messages does exist, and it is by definition out-of-scope for the Webinos project, it is good to take this category into account when discussing the requirements for messaging.

Answers on XMPP comments in the minuts.
---------------------------------------

Is there overlap between XMPP and the work of the W3C working groups on Web Event, Web Notifications and Real-time Communications?

From what I understand, the W3C WGs are working on APIs that can be used by web applications to access capabilities that are provided within the browser. They are not about specifying the underlying protocols that are used, by the runtime, to communicate over networks. Hence HTTP is not specified by W3C but by the IETF. The underlying protocols are litarly put out-of-scope by the real-time communication WG in section 1.2:

"The definition of the network protocols used to establish the connections between peers is out of scope for this group; in general, it is expected that protocols considerations will be handled in the IETF."

Our suggestion is to use XMPP as the underlying transport protocol for communication of messages and events between Webinos enabled entities. From my perspective the applications that are developed for the Webinos run-time should be agnostic on the underlying protocols but should use the W3C APIs where possible. The Webinos run-time itself should know about the underlying protocols.

In the future, WebSockets can be used to transport XMPP over back-and-forth between Webinos runtime and server. In current state-of-the-art this is done via BOSH (Bidirectional-streams Over Synchronous HTTP specified in XEP-0124).

Draft architecture
------------------

[[Event handling deliverable]] (work in progress)

_Feedback welcome. Put comments inline with you name/company and using block quotes (e.g., > Stefano/ISMB: blah blah blah.)._

### Overview

The event handling area is concerned with data exchange in terms of events among non-human addressable entities (e.g., applications, services, devices).

It relies on webinos’ overlay networking model and device/service/application discovery facilities to provide means for communicating, and provides mechanisms to describe, encapsulate, send and process event data.

The proposed architecture employs a simple but easily extensible design, and defines the core protocols for relatively advanced features such as RPC and publication/subscription functionality.

### Actors

Addressable entities, as specified by the requirements, include:

-   devices;
-   device features;
-   applications;
-   services;
-   application instances;
-   service instances. (?)

Furthermore, we do also require that PubSub nodes (see below) MUST be addressable.

> Stefano/ISMB: a PubSub kind-of-thing is not explicitly mentioned in the requirements, should it be added?

### Event format

Each event MUST contain:

  -------------- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ---------------------------
  Field          Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      JS representation                                                                                                             Transmitted as
  Type           identifier for the event type - this field does also determine the semantics of the payload field, if present                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    string other than "any" (reserved) and that would be a valid identifier in JS (regexp: [_a-zA-Z][_a-zA-Z0-9]*)   string
  Source         the original entity sending the message                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          proxy object                                                                                                                  address string
  Destinations   the entities that the event is originally sent to - each destination must also be associated with a destination type that specifies whether the destination is a primary recipient (like ‘To:’ in emails), a secondary recipient (like ‘Cc:’ in emails) or that the recipient is meant to receive a "blind carbon copy" of the event (like ‘Bcc:’ in emails)   3 arrays of proxy objects                                                                                                     3 sets of address strings

and MAY optionally contain:

  ------------------------------ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ ------------------------------------- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Field                          Description                                                                                                                                      JS representation                     Transmitted as

  In response to                 identifier of the original event that this event is a response to                                                                                SHA-256 hash string                   string
  Generation timestamp           moment in time in which the event is generated by the original event source                                                                      Date object                           string indicating milliseconds since 1970/01/01 (UTC) formatted in base 10 (i.e., Ã  la printf("%u", milliseconds);)
  Expiry timestamp               moment in time past which the event is no more valid/meaningful                                                                                  Date object                           string indicating milliseconds since 1970/01/01 (UTC) formatted in base 10 (i.e., Ã  la printf("%u", milliseconds);)
  Delivery notification wanted   flag indicating that the event source wants to be notified by the event destination(s) about the result of the event delivery (default: false)   boolean value                         "true" or "false"
  Cacheable                      flag indicating whether the event should be stored and forwarded later if a destination is currently unavailable (default: false)                booelan value                         "true" or "false"
  Forwardings                    list of forwardings (may be partial) the event was subject to                                                                                    ordered array of forwarding objects   ordered set of forwarding couples/triples ([source, destinations] or [source, destinations, timestamp])

  ------------------------------ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ ------------------------------------- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Furthermore, if the event was forwarded, the event SHOULD contain the source, destination and timestamp for each forwarding, and, in particular, it MUST contain such information (the timestamp being optional) w.r.t. the last forwarding.

> Stefano/ISMB: note on forwarding: in case we are concerned about the possibility of allowing applications to "synthesize" events claiming they come from an unaware source and asking for forwarding to the runtime, a simple way to prevent that would be to add to events one or more non JS-visible fields at the browser plugin level.

> Stefano/ISMB: requirement NM-DEV-FOKUS-108 is questionable, in that it is not clear why every event needs a generation timestamp and what’s the difference between event occurrence and event generation; it doesn’t even link to any use case and in the notes you read "Just an example"... the current architecture makes event generation timestamps optional instead, that means that the requirement should probably be changed.

Applications SHALL be allowed to act on the behalf of the entities they "own", i.e., they can generate events whose source is the owned entity and they will receive the events whose destination is the owned entity.

> Stefano/ISMB: How that ought to be implemented in a secure and reliable way is heavily dependent on a number of very high level issues that go well beyond the scope of this area.

The event identifier is determined by performing a SHA-256 hash on the one-to-one string serialization hereby described; the event ought to be serialized into a string with format using the "transmitted as" representation and using no characters for unspecified fields:

> type|source|{to_dest_1|to_dest_2|…|to_dest_n}{cc_dest_1|cc_dest_2|…|cc_dest_n}{bcc_dest_1|bcc_dest_2|…|bcc_dest_n}|in-response-to|generation-timestamp|expiry-timestamp|delivery-notification-wanted|cacheable|payload

> Stefano/ISMB: this has the following implications:
>
> # the identifier need not to be transmitted, since it can always be determined from the content of the event object itself - it may however be transmitted to perform an extra integrity check
> # special care should be put when performing stateful RPC or secure communication: since two different events with same content will lead to the same ID, the following countermeasures should be taken not to confuse them:
> **** if it is reasonable to assume that two or more such events cannot be generated by the same source within 1 ms, requiring the use of the timestamp is sufficient to ensure that IDs will be different;
> **** otherwise, a sensible solution might be requiring some state-related information to be present (e.g., requiring that the "In response to" field is always specified and/or requiring the use of a sequence counter in the payload).

### Delivery notifications

Delivery notifications have the type field set to "deliveryNotification", **mandatory** "In response to" field set and **mandatory** payload that indicates the delivery status of the event in question.

The payload data can be: "delivered", "failed" or "cached".

### RPC messages

RPC messages have the type field set to "rpc" and **mandatory** payload consisting of "JSON-RPC 2.0":http://groups.google.com/group/json-rpc/web/json-rpc-2-0 data.

In particular, responses (i.e., RPC messages containing Response objects) MUST also have the "In response to" field set.

RPC messages cannot be sent to users and requiring user intervention to determine the result of an RPC request is highly discouraged.

> Stefano/ISMB: Rationale: notifications and questions to the user are more likely to be stored and no assumptions could realistically be made on the user’s behavior.

### Publication/subscription

Publication/subscription works by active entities publishing or subscribing to "PubSub nodes", that are passive entities holding collections of events.

Four kinds of actors are involved in the management of a node:

1.  provider (cardinality: 1): the active entity that logically manages the storage of the PubSub node and that "runs the node" (i.e., receives and forwards messages from/to other involved actors).
2.  owner (cardinality: 1): the active entity that manages the lifecycle of the node and its configuration, including publication/subscription policy.
3.  publisher (cardinality: any): an entity that publishes content to the node.
4.  subscriber (cardinality: any): an entity that receives updates regarding the node content.

**N.B.**: the provider and the owner MUST be single entites, but that doesn’t mean they have to be single application instances. Indeed, application/service types are single entites, but MAY (SHOULD/SHALL?) refer to any number of instances.

> Stefano/ISMB: Actually, XMPP allows to have multiple owners for a PubSub node.

When a publisher publishes content to a PubSub node, the provider entity SHALL try to transmit it to all subscribers.

In other words, PubSub nodes represent a further level of indirection used to transmit data to "interested and authorized active entities" without specifying them explicitly.

Note that PubSub nodes may be themselves publishers or subscribers to other PubSub nodes; this provides a conceptually simple mean to do collection and/or forwarding of events in a more complicated fashion than with single PubSub nodes. The subscription of a node to another node may only be requested by the owner of the subscribing node and MUST be controlled/authorized by the provider entity in order to avoid creating loops. Furthermore, the provider SHOULD ensure that a PubSub node never contains two copies of the same event.

A discovery mechanism for PubSub nodes SHALL be provided.

> Stefano/ISMB: IMO the discovery mechanism should be formalized in the "device, service, application discovery" area. PubSub nodes may, hence, be services or part of (a) service(s).

#### PubSub node configuration

##### Persistence

-   Persistent nodes: meant to be alive until explicit destruction - e.g., RSS-like streams, if the owner entity is not present (e.g., application/service crash, device disconnected) they continue to be available;
-   Temporary nodes: automatically destroyed by the provider when the owner is no more present - e.g., IPC among different application/service instances;

**N.B.**: "presence" means different things in different contexts and w.r.t. different entities. Nevertheless we define presence of one entity w.r.t. another as the logical conjunction of the entity existence and availability - in other words, an entity is present to another entity if it exists (e.g., an application instance exists as long as it runs) AND there is a way to transport data between the two (e.g, connection - direct or indirect) AND the policies of all involved entities (both entities plus others in the middle, if any) allow for each other to exchange presence information.

> Stefano/ISMB: in case XMPP is chosen, the WRE SHALL ensure that the following conditions are met:
>
> * as soon as a new addressable entity becomes available, it SHALL force broadcasting of its presence information (e.g., as per RFC 3921, it SHALL send a presence stanza with no type attribute to the server);
> * it SHALL keep track of remote temporary nodes created by active entities running on it in order to ensure their destruction in case of "sudden disconnection" as soon as the device regains connectivity to the provider (XMPP lacks self-destruction of PubSub nodes).
>
> At this point one serious problem remains: in case of "sudden disconnection" of the owner entity (whether temporary or not), the remote temporary nodes still exist and may even still allow subscriptions, publishing, etc. One possible solution to this problem is to have yet another remote proxy entity that is somehow guaranteed to be (almost) always connected to the provider, so that it appears as the owner of the node to the XMPP server, but it basically just forwards requests from the logical owner entity and manages the destruction of temporary nodes itself.
>
> Another (easier) option is to use BOSH to avoid node destruction in case of temporary connection losses.

##### Discoverability

The discoverability options for a PubSub node should be the same or aligned with the discoverability options for services in Webinos.

> Stefano/ISMB: in a certain sense a PubSub node may actually be considered as a "passive service".

> Stefano/ISMB: discoverability options idea: open access, whitelist, blacklist, authorization request forwarded to the owner, special rules (e.g., discoverable if the discovering entity is a user in the "owner’s roster", non discoverable by users, discoverable by applications).

##### Publication/subscription policy

The options for publishing/subscribing to a PubSub node should be the same or aligned to those for accessing a service in Webinos.

> Stefano/ISMB: one more reason to consider PubSub nodes as services. This has interesting consequences w.r.t. the application/service distinction problem… idea: a service might be a passive entity managed by one or more applications, maybe?

_more configuration options?_

#### PubSub node requests

##### Node creation

The requesting active entity, that in case of success will be the owner of the newly created node, SHALL send an event to the provider entity, optionally specifying:

-   the node persistence (i.e., persistent vs temporary, default: temporary);
-   the node identifier (default: automatically generated);
-   node configuration key/value pairs (see Node configuration, default: default configuration).

The request SHALL fail if (the following list is non-exhaustive):

1.  the requesting entity is known not to be an active entity;
2.  the receiving entity is not a provider of PubSub nodes;
3.  the requesting entity is not authorized to create PubSub nodes;
4.  the requested node identifier already exists.

Except in cases 1 and 2, if the request fails, the receiving entity SHOULD report the error condition to the sender.

If, instead, the request was successful, the provider SHALL try to notify the owner about the success in creating the node, along with the assigned node identifier and SHALL be automatically given publishing rights.

TODO: syntax of request, syntax/semantics of responses.

##### Node destruction

###### Case 1: the owner asks the provider for node destruction

The owner of a node sends a node destruction request to the node provider. Such request shall specify the identifier of the node to be destroyed.

The request SHALL fail if (the following list is non-exhaustive):

1.  the requesting entity is known not to be an active entity;
2.  the receiving entity is not a provider of PubSub nodes;
3.  the specified node does not exist;
4.  the requesting entity is not the node owner.

Except in cases 1 and 2, if the request fails, the receiving entity SHOULD report the error condition to the sender.

If, instead, the request was successful, the provider SHALL try to notify the owner about the success in destroying the node and SHOULD notify all publishers and subscribers other than the node owner about the destruction of the node.

TODO: syntax of request, syntax/semantics of responses.

###### Case 2: the node is automatically destroyed by the provider

In case the owner of temporary nodes becomes no more present, the provider(s) of such nodes SHALL destroy them and SHOULD notify all publishers and subscribers other than the node owner about the destruction of the node.

TODO: syntax/semantics of destruction notification.

###### Case 3: the provider decides to destroy the node

The provider SHALL be able, in any moment and for whatever reason, to destroy a PubSub node.

In those cases it SHOULD notify the owner, all publishers and subscribers about the node destruction.

TODO: syntax/semantics of destruction notification.

##### Getting node configuration

The owner SHALL be able to retrieve the node configuration by sending a node configuration retrieval request to the provider specifying the node identifier.

The request SHALL fail if (the following list is non-exhaustive):

1.  the requesting entity is known not to be an active entity;
2.  the receiving entity is not a provider of PubSub nodes;
3.  the specified node does not exist;
4.  the requesting entity is not the node owner.

Except in cases 1 and 2 (and maybe 3 as well?), if the request fails, the receiving entity SHOULD report the error condition to the sender.

If, instead, the request was successful, the provider SHALL send a response to the sender containing a list of key/value pairs representing all node configuration settings for the specified node.

TODO: syntax/semantics of key/value pairs, syntax of response.

##### Configuring a node

The owner SHOULD be able to configure the node by sending a node configuration request to the provider, specifying:

-   the node identifier;
-   one or more node configuration key/value pairs.

Such key/value pairs represent a node configuration setting, where the key serves as the configuration option identifier and value is the requested settings and has option-specific syntax.

The request SHALL fail if (the following list is non-exhaustive):

1.  the requesting entity is known not to be an active entity;
2.  the receiving entity is not a provider of PubSub nodes;
3.  the specified node does not exist;
4.  the requesting entity is not the node owner;
5.  one or more key/value pairs are invalid;
6.  the requested settings are not supported;
7.  the request cannot be satisfied because of the provider’s policy settings.

Except in cases 1 and 2 (and maybe 3 as well?), if the request fails, the receiving entity SHOULD report the error condition to the sender.

If, instead, the request was successful, the provider SHALL try to notify the owner about the success of the operation and SHOULD notify those publishers and subscribers, other than the node owner, for which that MAY have consequences in the usage of the node.

TODO: syntax/semantics of key/value pairs, detailed notification behavior.

##### Getting affiliations

The owner SHOULD be able to request the status of affiliations (i.e., the list of publishers and subscribers) to the provider by sending an affiliation retrieval request specifying the node identifier.

The request SHALL fail if (the following list is non-exhaustive):

1.  the requesting entity is known not to be an active entity;
2.  the receiving entity is not a provider of PubSub nodes;
3.  the specified node does not exist;
4.  the requesting entity is not the node owner.

Except in cases 1 and 2 (and maybe 3 as well?), if the request fails, the receiving entity SHOULD report the error condition to the sender.

If, instead, the request was successful, the provider SHALL send a response to the sender containing a list of key/value pairs where each key represents an affiliated entity and the value represents the kind of affiliation (publisher, subscriber or both) that the entity represented by the key has w.r.t the node.

TODO: syntax of key/value pairs, syntax of response.

##### Setting affiliations

The owner SHOULD be able to modify affiliations to the node by sending an affiliation change request to the provider, specifying:

-   the node identifier;
-   one or more node affiliation key/value pairs.

Such key/value pairs represent an entity affiliation to the node, where the key represents an affiliated entity and the value represents the kind of affiliation (none, publisher, subscriber or both) that the entity represented by the key will have w.r.t the node.

The request SHALL fail if (the following list is non-exhaustive):

1.  the requesting entity is known not to be an active entity;
2.  the receiving entity is not a provider of PubSub nodes;
3.  the specified node does not exist;
4.  the requesting entity is not the node owner;
5.  one or more key/value pairs are invalid.

Except in cases 1 and 2 (and maybe 3 as well?), if the request fails, the receiving entity SHOULD report the error condition to the sender.

If, instead, the request was successful, the provider SHALL try to notify the owner about the success of the operation and SHOULD notify those entities affected by the change.

TODO: syntax/semantics of key/value pairs, detailed notification behavior.

##### Publish authorization

Entities SHALL be able to ask for publishing rights authorization to the provider, specifying the PubSub node identifier.

The request SHALL fail if (the following list is non-exhaustive):

1.  the receiving entity is not a provider of PubSub nodes;
2.  the specified node does not exist;
3.  the node configuration does not allow the requesting entity to be granted publishing rights for that node.

Furthermore, according to the node’s publication/subscription policies, the request MAY be forwarded to the node owner and a notification about that MAY be sent to the requesting entity.

Except in case 1, if the request fails, the receiving entity SHOULD report the error condition to the sender.

If, instead, the request was successful, the provider SHOULD try to notify the owner and the newly added publisher about the success of the operation.

TODO: syntax of request, syntax/semantics of responses.

> Stefano/ISMB: this is different from XMPP, where the owner does add publishers to the node. However a mapping is still possible by requiring to have the owner’s JID in the discoverable node metadata. IMO, our approach is generally better than XMPP’s, since it allows to automatically assign or reject publish authorization, when the policy is configured in that way, thus reducing the complexity of the owner and the amount of generated traffic.

##### Subscription

Entities SHALL be able to ask for subscription to the provider, specifying the PubSub node identifier.

The request SHALL fail if (the following list is non-exhaustive):

1.  the receiving entity is not a provider of PubSub nodes;
2.  the specified node does not exist;
3.  the node configuration does not allow the requesting entity to be subscribe to that node.

Furthermore, according to the node’s publication/subscription policies, the request MAY be forwarded to the node owner and a notification about that MAY be sent to the requesting entity.

Except in case 1, if the request fails, the receiving entity SHOULD report the error condition to the sender.

If, instead, the request was successful, the provider SHOULD try to notify the owner and the newly added subscriber about the success of the operation.

TODO: syntax of request, syntax/semantics of responses.

##### Publication

A publisher entity SHALL be able to publish content to a PubSub node by sending a publishing request to the provider, specifying the PubSub node identifier and the content to be published.

The request SHALL fail if (the following list is non-exhaustive):

1.  the receiving entity is not a provider of PubSub nodes;
2.  the specified node does not exist;
3.  the requesting entity is not a publisher for the specified node.

Except in case 1, if the request fails, the receiving entity SHOULD report the error condition to the sender.

If, instead, the request was successful, the provider SHALL try to notify the requesting publisher about the success of the operation and SHALL try to forward the published content to all subscribers.

TODO: syntax of request, syntax/semantics of responses.

### Event routing

#### Application/service instance-level routing

![](ev_instance_routing.png)

##### Event generation and listening

From the applicaiton/service developer point of view, the handling of simple events reduces to two basic concepts: generating new events and registering listeners for incoming events.

The event handling Javascript API will be asynchronous, hence the application/service developer will provide callbacks implementing the listeners and to be notified of the result of sending an event (success, failure, cached, others?).

Event sources and event destinations will be in a 1:N relationship in the general case, hence multiple listeners will be able to listen to the same event.

###### Delivery notification

A delivery notifications is an event that is sent in response to another event explicitly asking for it via the "Delivery notification wanted" field (see Event format).

TBC

###### Event forwarding

TBD

##### PubSub node requests

The PubSub API will be built on top of the event handling API, that implies, among other things, that it will be completely asynchronous.

An instance SHALL be able to become PubSub node provider if authorized (e.g., stated in the application manifest - to be decided), and the WRE shall provide a default and extensible/"hookable" PubSub API and implementation to build upon, if needed.

> Stefano/ISMB: this is to gain better scalability, modularity, concurrency, security and reduce device-level traffic… on the other hand it makes no sense to have this "centralized" in the WRE, since, being the PubSub implementation completely event-based, it would be easy to build equivalent mechanisms at an application level. In other words it’s way better to provide an extensible API/implementation rather than trying to force everybody to use a "closed" one, thus avoiding the risk of having people implementing their own incompatible mechanisms. In case moving PubSub traffic back and forth the provider application results too heavy, it should be possible to have the default mechanism implemented by the WRE, and overridden only if/when requested by the provider application itself.

##### Dispatcher

![](ev_instance_disp.png)

(dashed lines: PubSub node requests from/to other addressable entities)

FIXME: instance-specific PubSub nodes make no sense, those should be removed from the drawing above.

The event dispatcher is a logical unit that represents the event processing mechanism hidden to the application developer.

Its input and output event queues are meant to be provided by the event handling Javascript implementation, while the routing part (i.e., the actual moving of data from the application to the outside and viceversa) is up to the browser plugin.

In particular, the browser plugin is expected to process events in the browser’s event loop (e.g., by adding a hook into that loop - the whole process could either be done in native code or there could be a JS part too - this, however, is abstracted away by the proposed design).

Event queues are needed in order for the API to be asynchronous (e.g., multiple sends between two event loop executions).

On instance destruction, events in the out queue will be forwarded, while events in the in queue will either be discarded (messages to the specific instance, messages to the application/service type while there are other such application/service instances that have received the same message) or put back into the WRE cache (all other cases).

##### API mockup

###### Basic eventing

webinos.Event = function(type, to, cc, bcc, from, respTo, timeStamp, expireStamp, notifyMe, data, id)

> Event object constructor

webinos.addListener = function(cb, source, type)

> Adds a listener callback (cb) for events of the specified type (type) and generated by the specified source (source). If type or source (or both) is (are) null, no filtering w.r.t. that parameter is done (e.g., if both are null, the listener callback catches all incoming events).
>
> Returns a string that uniquely identifies the listener.

webinos.removeListener = function(id)

> Removes the listener callback identified by the given id string.

webinos.sendEvent = function(evt, cb)

> Sends the evt event object; cb, if specified, is the callback for being notified of the sending status.

###### RPC

TBD

###### PubSub

TBD

#### Device-level routing

![](ev_device_routing.png)

The WRE Browser Plugin handles events (creates events into in queues and deletes them from out queues, calls Javascript callbacks) and routes messages among applications/services/WRE and from/to "the outside".

Device-specific PubSub nodes and event cache are located in either the HTML/JS part of the WRE, or in the Browser Plugin (which is more convenient? â€“ to be decided).

> Stefano/ISMB: IMO the Browser Plugin should be â€œas stateless and small as possibleâ€, hence PubSub nodes and event cache should belong to the HTML/JS part.
>
> WRE HTML/JS could also be made of a number of separate â€œspecial servicesâ€ rather than one big thing - there is a parallel to the OS development world: microkernel vs monolithic kernels.
>
> I tend to like a hybrid approach, where the browser plugin could just implement the kind of event-based IPC+networking described here, a limited set of relatively low-level device APIs that only the HTML/JS "daemons" belonging to the WRE can directly access, and another limited set of application/service-level APIs that need to be synchronous, hence cannot be event-based.
>
> Then, if all synchronous APIs are stateless, it means that all of the state is in Javascript form, hence easily serializable to, e.g., JSON. This could heavily simplify state/session management (e.g., state could be split in device-state-specific data and WRE/application-state data, that is the session).
>
> Then we would have all the benefits of microkernel-like systems (isolation of faulty components with the possibility to restart them on crash and/or to substitute them on the fly).

#### Network-level routing

![](ev_net_routing.png)

Events will be routed according to the mechanisms/mappings specified in the "overlay network" area.

> Stefano/ISMB: I advocate the use of XMPP since it is quite close already to what we want to do. The domain, user and device part would map to the JID, and would suffice to establish a connection, even if the parties don’t have public IP addresses.
>
> It would make things like remote device/service/application discovery trivial to do (also because we would have the same addressing scheme for anything that’s Webinos-enabled).
>
> Furthermore, it does support P2P communication already. We could either use their solution, that implies using Zeroconf, but I think it would be better to provide our own, which to me looks all but difficult to do and which would allow us to gain in integration (e.g., we might want to use UPnP instead, or support both, or DPWS).

##### Client-server communication

TBD

##### P2P networks

TBD

##### NAT traversal

TBD

#### Caching (storing/forwarding)

### Notifications

Notification messages can be of two kinds: notification requests and notification responses.

#### Notification requests

Notification requests have the type field set to _<TO BE DECIDED>_, can only be directed to users and have **mandatory** payload consisting of the JSON serialization of a notification object.

A notification object MUST contain:

  Summary   Single line overview of the notification (e.g., "You have mail")   string
  --------- -------------------------------------------------------------------- -------------------

and MAY contain:

  -------------------- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ---------------------------------------------------
  Field                Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             JS representation
  Replaces ID          Event ID of an existing notification that this notification is intended to replace (this also serves to cancel a previous notifications involving user interaction)                                                                                                                                                     hash string

  Expiration timeout   number of milliseconds since the display of the notification at which the notification should automatically close                                                                                                                                                                                                       numeric value
  -------------------- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ---------------------------------------------------

> Stefano/ISMB: should add human-readable name of the sender?

> Stefano/ISMB: Rationales:
> * URIs for category: possibility to automatically get metadata for unknown categories in the future (e.g., RDF data from the specified URI);
> * URIs for icons: known URIs will correspond to cached/stored icons - no need to retrieve them again (it should be ok for theming too, the URI points to the default icon, a local setting overrides that), while unknown non-data URIs point to an image that can be just downloaded.

The WRE is responsible for the handling and visualization of incoming notifications.

> Stefano/ISMB: a (privileged?) API may be offered to intercept, interact and/or replace the WRE notification system…

The urgency level parameter does also give an indication on whether a notification SHOULD be somehow logged/remembered (by default, it should be the case if it is "normal" or "critical") or not.

> Stefano/ISMB: deliberate vagueness here.

#### Notification responses

Notification responses have the type field set to _<TO BE DECIDED>_, can only be coming from users and have **mandatory** payload consisting of just the chosen action keyword and **mandatory** "In response to" field set to the original notification request identifier.

Such events SHALL always have the entity that sent the original notification as the primary recipient and the receiving user as secondary recipient, so that all devices owned by the user become aware of the fact that a response was given (e.g., they can close the notification).

Normally, responses to notification requests that are somehow logged/remembered (e.g., having "normal" or "critical" as urgency level) SHOULD be logged/remembered as well.
