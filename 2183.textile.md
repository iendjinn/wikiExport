Remote UI Usage
===============

Currently while applications can access underlying device features (like GPS, screen orientation or sensors) remotely, they can’t access a remote UI (user interface) directly. The intended way of displaying information on a remote device is to run a second web application on that device. The second application should then present the UI on that device and communicate with the primary application. In some cases however, the information displayed on a remote device might be trivial (such as a ‘you have mail’ prompt on a TV screen, with the mail application running on a tablet or laptop) and providing a full web application for a simple prompt is inconvenient.

In such cases, a direct manipulation of the remote DOM would be desirable. While this might cause problems in other systems (unwanted pop-ups, impersonation, communication protocol, discovery of remote UI), webinos is well suited to provide a resolution here, since the underlying challenges are already solved for other types of remote access (such as sensor or location access) and remote UI access could be provided with relative ease while using available mechanisms.

Specification
-------------

Two of the important advantages of webinos are the capability of accessing device features remotely and multi-device applications. Any webinos device can offer access to its UI the same way as any other service is offered. The access to the service is governed by policy settings on the local and remote device.

On binding to the service, a window on the remote device is opened, which needs to be uniquely recognizable as a window instantiated by a remote instance by having a specific frame and including information about which application on which device has opened it remotely. The purpose of this is to avoid remote programs being able to spoof the appearance of programs running locally on the device.

The window will show a textual/graphical presentation of the device that runs the application and the iconic/text representation of the application using the window. Within the window, the access to the DOM "document" element is restricted to a document element of iFrame. If the runtime environment supports that feature, the iFrame should be instantiated with the "sandbox" attribute. The opened window on the remote device contains as named elements a head element with the id "head" and a body element with the id "body".

Binding to a service creates an object that exposes the remoteDOM() method, which takes, in addition to a success and error callback, a DOMstring paramenter. This string will be transmitted to the remote device and executed there, using the eval() method. All remote DOM commands need to be individually and directly executable on the remote "document" element. the service returned by the findService on remote UI functions will not be a mirror of the remote DOM, but will expose a method (remoteDOM) that allows the passing of commands to be executed on the remote UI. Basic values from the remote DOM can be retrieved, but not objects.

This is mainly relevant on the creation of elements, since it is necessary that the elements receive an unique id and are added to the parent element in a single operation, so that the object can later be referenced by the object id.

Not possible is the following construct:
<pre>
remote_doc.remoteDOM("var d = remote_document.createElement(‘div’);");
remote_doc.remoteDOM("d.id=‘div-id’;");
remote_doc.remoteDOM("document.getElementById(‘body’).appendChild(d);");");
</pre>

This needs to be performed as a single command with ‘document’ as the root element:
<pre>
remote_doc.remoteDOM("document.getElementById(‘body’).appendChild((document.createElement(‘div’))).id=‘div-id’;");</pre>

In a practical example:
<pre>
webinos.discovery.findServices(new ServiceType{api:‘http://webinos.org/api/remoteUI’},
 {onFound: function (service) {
 remote_doc = service;
 }});
remote_doc.remoteDOM("document.getElementById(‘body’).appendChild((document.createElement(‘div’))).id=‘div-id’;
remote_doc.remoteDOM("document.getElementById(‘div-id’).appendChild(document.createElement(‘p’)).id=‘p-id’;
remote_doc.remoteDOM("document.getElementById(‘p-id’).textContent =("You got mail!");
</pre>

In most cases, this only requires adaptation on the creation of elements. Once they are created, attached and have an id, remote DOM manipulation will be similar to using it on a local system.

<div class="uml">
participant "Application" as APP
participant "Local PZP" as LPZP
participant "Remote PZP" as RPZP
participant "Remote UI " as RUI
APP -> LPZP: Find Service "Remote UI"
LPZP -> RPZP: Discover Service "Remote UI"
RPZP -> LPZP: Return Service "Remote UI"
LPZP -> APP: onFound:Service"Remote UI"
APP -> LPZP: remote_document = Service"Remote UI";
LPZP -> RPZP: Bind Service "Remote UI"
RPZP -> RUI: Open Window
RUI -> RUI: [Window opens]
APP -> LPZP: remoteDOM("document.createElement(…);");
LPZP -> RPZP: Service"Remote UI"(eval("document.createElement(…);"));
RPZP -> RUI: document.createElement(…);
RUI -> RUI: [Element is added]
