Implementation Architecture
===========================

Device discovery faces challenges of multiplicity of networking technology. Different internetworking technologies are likely to adopt a variety of discovery protocols among themselves. As a result, the services information & presentations from different discovery processes vary depending on the discovery mechanisms used. While on the other hand, web developers donâ€™t want to know the details of the bearers and prefer to have generic structures for different services. A solution as shown in Figure 1 is to provide two layers of APIs - a high level discovery and context APIs in webinos using Javascript libraries built on top on lower level one specific to each interconnect technology, with mappings between under layer details to the generic upper layer discovery API.

This solution will bring two benefits:
* Reduces effort for developing applications
* Tolerance to changes in networking technologies, addressing schemes and topologies

In this section, we will look at the implementation issues from the following aspects:
* Low level native code & APIs
* High level JavaScript APIs
* Mappings/wrappings between lower level and high level implementations

The descriptions are based on the use scenarios described in the earlier part of Discovery section.

Scenario 1 - George wants to view his mobile hosted MP4s on his set top box and both devices have access to the internetÂ¶
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Implementation 1.1: Set Box can be reached via local connection. George to discover his set box via local discovery â€“ Internet access is not essential.

**Aspect 1:** Low level native codes & APIs - Georgeâ€™s mobile scans for his set box with any local discovery implementations. We give a few examples as below:

-   Avahi - Zeroconf implementation

Avahi is a zeroconf implementation It provides a good range of for multicast DNS/DNS-SD service discovery. It is under the GNU Lesser General Public License (LGPL). With the advantage being open source over Appleâ€™s Bojour implementation, Avahi had already become the de-facto standard implementation of mDNS/DNS-SD on free operating systems such as Linux.

Avahi provides a set of language bindings, e.g . python, C, C+*. It ships with most Linux and **BSD distributions. Avahi source codes are available to download free online.

Following figure illustrated some main APIs used in avahi.

** BlueZ - Bluetooth

BlueZ is a widespread Bluetooth stack implementations initially developed by Qualcomm. It is included with the official Linux kernel distributions. As of 2006, the BlueZ stack supports all core Bluetooth protocols and layers [wiki]. BlueZ provides a set of language bindings such as python, C, Java, C*+ etc.

[In our implementation, hci_inquiry performs a Bluetooth device discovery and returns a list of detected devices and some basic information about them in the variable.]

-   UPnP implementations. There are a few open sources UPnP implementations existing for Linux system, e.g. gupnp-tools and upnp-inspector. Since these implementations may come with a lot dependencies, e.g gupnp implementation depends on glib etc. As SSDP protocol is not so complicated itself, an alternative way is to write our own SSDP codes. See [http://www.w3.org/2011/04/discovery.html]

-   OpenSLP â€“ SLP

The OpenSLP project is an effort to develop an open-source implementation of the IETF Service Location Protocol suitable for commercial and non-commercial application. It is under the Caldera Systems open source license - a license that is legally compatible with the popular BSD open source license[ http://www.openslp.org/]. OpenSLP is hosted by SourceForge.net and source code and binaries are free for download.

Main APIs:

Registration - SLPReg (…, service_type, service_attribute, callback…);
Service find - SLPFindSrvs (…, service_type, filter, callback…);

**Aspect 2:** High level JS discovery implementations

The high level discovery implementation is to expose both low level discovery interfaces, device and service features to web developers and end users, ideally in JavaScript. This means to advertise, find and bind services via web page scripts. The scripts listen for requests from other browsers and then respond in some manner. This might involve extensions on the current browsers with a server of some kind. Extensions on browser out the scope of discovery and will not be discussed here. High level discovery APIs that are going to be exposed to web developers, however, should be defined and illustrated. Details on high level JavaScript APIs are described in API & protocol sections.

Exchange device/service request and response messages are handled by event handling or messaging. It can be implemented in http level or socket level. Refer event handling and dependencies sections for details on messaging exchange.

**Aspect 3:** Mappings/wrappings between lower level & high level implementations

To expose low level native codes to high level Javascript, one option is to use a cross browser plugin. Following figure shows an example on exposing avahi_service_browser_new() api to a Javascript object using NPAPI. Refer section on plugin for more details on Browser plug-in/extension handling .

Scenario 2 - George wants to listet to Pauls MP4s on his mobile - mobile to mobile, and both have access to the internetÂ¶
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Scenario 3 - George has music hosted on a web service, and wants to listen to them on his own mobile deviceÂ¶
