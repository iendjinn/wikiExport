The adaptation is regulated and executed by two main components. The WRT is linked to the webinos bootstrap component (which is injected at start-up time). This component contains an _Adaptation Client_ which is bootstrapped at application launch and will execute all the UI adaptations. The second component is the _Adaptation Manager_, which resides in the PZP. The Adaptation Manager aggregates all the rules, analyzes the rules and stores them in an Adaptation Rule Engine, registers itself with various services, fetches properties and fires adaptation rules by sending them to the Adaptation Client.

As the figure above demonstrates, the Application is the packaged application as explained in the section "webinos Applications and Widget Runtime specification". The application contains its content and various metadata. Newly defined here are the application rules, which can be defined by application developers who want to adapt their application to the running context and context changes. The metadata will also contain two settings:
* A setting which can disable the adaptation process completely
* and one that will only disable the generic platform adaptation rules contained in the Adaptation Manager.
