PZH
===

{{toc}}

A webinos personal zone is a combination of two types of entity, Personal Zone Hubs (PZHs) and [[PZP_Introduction|Personal Zone Proxies]] (PZPs). There is only one PZH in each zone and it is reachable on the public Internet at all times. It can either be a cloud-based service or could be integrated in a DSL router. A PZP, on the other hand, usually resides on a user operated device. There is one exception - a cloud-based PZP (which does not belong to a user operated device) can be created to expose services that other PZPs can use, such as context database.

In client - server terminology, the PZH acts as a server in the webinos architecture and the PZPs act as clients. The PZH is limited to just one user, i.e. Alice is a sole owner of her PZH. If the user wishes to establish communication with the other users, they securely exchange certificate and perform connection between the two personal zones.

PZHs provide the following functionality:

NA: question to ask ourselves here: is there enough information and what is the check list for me to imlement a full PZH in Python for example. is most of the material required in PZH admin section

habib: All the relevant details has been covered such as message exchanges, pzh web server information, directory structure, pzh tls connection. IMO the material needed to implement include whole of PZH and PZH deployment to understand how to communicate with the PZH

-   Routing communication between personal zone devices
-   Synchronizing information about the personal zone, including access control policies and device certificates
-   Administration of the personal zone through a web interface
-   Export and import of personal zone information.
-   Storing of certificates, trusted list of devices, policies and user data.
-   Support for service discovery API.

[andrÃ©] see comment about events API in events API section!

Most of these capabilities are described in more detail in the [[PZH Admin]] section.

In this document we refer to the PZH as a monolithic server. In implementation, PZH runs externally at service provider. To support running at same address and port, it uses SNI (server name indication) and is covered in detail in the informative section, [[PZH deployment]].

Pre-configuration
-----------------

Starting a PZH results in the web server running and listening for the incoming connections. The PZH and its web server must only allow secure connections over TLS, so when the PZH runs for the first time it will create a set of X509 certificates as shown in Figure 1.

PZH configuration
-----------------

The PZH creation does not bind it with a particular user. The PZH are configured through the owner logging into the PZH web interface for the first time using their chosen OpenId credentials. Webinos uses OpenId mechanism to authenticate the user. The PZH does not provide any mechanism for storing user credentials, once authenticated via OpenId, webinos platform allow users to perform various actions.

Any other mechanism that can validate user but does not mandate the PZH to hold user/password on the PZH could be used for the user authentication purpose. In this specification only OpenId mechanism is covered, it does not cover details about other mechanism that could be used for user authentication.

[andrÃ©] Why does webinos needs OpenId support? Is it used for something else than just log-in to PZH? I understand the current implementation doesn’t wanted to store and handle user data itself. But isn’t this implementation specific. Can i implement a PZH using electronic identity cards (like the German one http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_identity_card) or just using Username/Password and ask for user data?

[habib] no it is for user authentication and not implementation specific. Since any mechanism for username and password will mandate storing information and we do not want the PZH to have any secure/database storing mechanism.

After the user has successfully logged in, the PZH will received an identity assertion from the OpenID identity provider providing about the user details. This identity information will then be re-used when authenticating subsequent log-ins by the zone owner.

Once configured with the user identity, the TLS server is initialized and will wait for the incoming PZP connections. The processes involved in PZH configuration are:

-   Certificate generation (see the [[Personal Zone Key Infrastructure]] documentation to see which certificates are required)
-   Initialization of PZH TLS Server
-   Storing certificates, keys and user data

This is a one time activity that will be dependent on the PZH service provider rules. In this document we do not specify how a PZH provider will configure their system or how users are allowed to create PZHs. It is assumed before providing login option, user has to select the service provider’s facilities.

The PZH can also be created from the PZP, It is part of browser enrollment as described in the "PZH Admin":http://dev.webinos.org/redmine/projects/wp3-3/wiki/PZH_Admin section. In the PZP enrollment step, if the PZH does not exist it asks for a user consent to create the PZH. Based on the user consent, the PZH is created for the user. It is similar in process as described above, but differs only that it is initiated from the PZP end.

[andrÃ©] PZH Admin spec does not describe how this can happen when triggered from the PZP. Connect to PZH provider? How, protocols needed? How to tell PZH provider that i want to create a new PZH for me?

[andrÃ©] Yes it does please auth-status message. I have covered in pzh admin all protocols and message detail. By logging in if pzh does not exists it creates for you. As described before above diagram PZH provider should impose some rules before allowing PZH to be created.

After PZH is configured, the following functions will be performed by the PZH.

-   Create PZH default policy
-   Create PZH identity
-   Assign PZH address
-   Update PZH/PZP Status
-   Messaging and routing
-   Service discovery

### PZH default policy

After the PZH is configured it should be given a set of default policies. Policies comprise a target, set of rules and conditions. The policy target should make sure that this PZH can only be used by the user identity provided. Default policy are covered in the "following section":http://dev.webinos.org/redmine/projects/wp3-3/wiki/Policy#Default-policy.

[andrÃ©] did we defined how the default policy looks like? If so provide reference, if not we need to define one.

[habib] added link, salvatore is going to add contents to above link

### PZH Identity

The identity assigned to the PZH is fetched via user authentication mechanism. The user authentication mechanism should return attributes of values that identifies the user. The information that the PZH looks after authentication are the user’s first name, last name, country and email id. The PZH identity used is user email id such as alice@example.org

[andrÃ©] again, is OpenID really mandatory or implementation specific? Currently still don’t see that OpenID is a must for a PZH.

[habib] IMO still yes it is mandatory but altered text to make it generic .

### PZH Address

The PZH should be reachable by a standard URL and this address can be enrolled with the WebFinger server in order to map it to a user identity. This address should be reachable to user all the time when connected to the Internet. The [[Entity Definitions]] documentation describes the address of a PZH.

A WebFinger server should typically return following following attributes. The attribute pzhid should describe the fields.

<pre>
 <Subject>acct:alice@example.org</Subject>
 <Link rel=`http://webinos.org/spec/1.0’
 ref=`http://pzh.example.org/alice@example.org’/>
</pre>

To find another user PZH, minimum information needed is user email id to retrieve value from the WebFinger server.

[andrÃ©] could we have an example here? On the one hand we could say that discovering PZH address is out of scope of the spec but if we say WebFinger can be used don’t we need then to specify something like a key that represents a webinos PZH URL? Or how to know which URL is the one for the PZH?

[habib]added information about pzh id.

### Messaging and Routing

The PZH provides routes between personal zone devices and for communication outside the personal zone devices. It is a central point of communication in the personal zone architecture and facilitates devices in different location communicate despite location or the network they are using. Routing is performed by the PZH which is trusted to send messages to the right locations. Messaging:"http://dev.webinos.org/redmine/projects/wp3-3/wiki/Messaging_and_Routing" section covers this in details.

### PZH/PZP Status Update

The PZH maintains a list of all the PZPs and the PZHs that may be connected to the PZH at any time, as well as their current connection status. This includes list of trusted the PZP’s which are not connected. The PZH sends the PZP _update_ message at the following occasions :

-   PZP connected to the personal zone
-   PZP disconnected from the personal zone.
-   A PZH from another zone has connected
-   A PZH from another zone has disconnected

The update message include following fields:
* Remote PZP’s friendly name and identity
* Remote PZH’s friendly name and identity
* Connection status i.e current connection between the PZH and other PZHs

[andrÃ©] clarify that the connection status is about a connection between "my PZH" and other PZHs - otherwise it reads like my PZH sends me a message about if i am connected to my PZH.

[habib] comments addressed

The update message sent by PZH to PZP format is presented below:
JSON:
<pre>
{
 â€œtoâ€: PZP ID,
 â€œfromâ€: PZH ID,
 â€œtypeâ€: â€œpropâ€,
 â€œpayloadâ€: {
 â€œstatusâ€:â€Updateâ€,
 â€œmessageâ€: {
 "PZH":
 {
 ["name": "",
 "connected":true/false]
 },
 "PZP":
 {
 ["name": "",
 "connected":true/false,
 "ipaddress": "",
 "port": ""]
 }
 }
 }
}
</pre>

The PZH uses identity information internally but for display purposes the user is always shown a friendly name.

### Service Discovery

Each webinos enabled device has a set of services. These services are updated in the PZH when they connect or when they become available. These services are discoverable by other PZP’s. The PZH acts as a central repository to get all services searchable for all connected PZP’s. It also holds services hosted at other PZHs that belong to the trusted third parties, such as friends. All services hosted at the PZH are services from connected PZPs and PZHs.

Details are covered further in the [[Service Discovery]] section.

PZH Components
--------------

The PZH provides a web interface for administering the personal zone. This administrative functionality can only be accessed through logging into the PZH with OpenID user credentials. After logging into a PZH web interface, the user can:

-   Enrol and revoke devices
-   Establish connections with other personal zones
-   Export and import data

### Enrolling and Revoke device

Enrolling a new personal zone device is a one-time event (per device) that allows a new PZP to join the personal zone. More information about this can be found in the [[PZH_Admin|PZH Administration]] section.

Removing (or "revoking") a device from a personal zone is also done through the same web interface. After revocation all personal zone devices and known PZHs are updated with this information.

### PZH - PZH Communication

Communication between two PZHs requires the owners of both zones to be able to identify one another and trust each other. Identification is assured through a certificate exchange protocol described in the [[Personal Zone Key Infrastructure]] section . Once certificates have been exchanged both PZHs can connect to each other, although policies will limit what these are able to do, with no access granted by default.

### Export and Import of PZH

The PZH can be migrated from its current service provider to another provider. Export and import ensures policies, user preferences and user details are moved to new location. More detail on this can be found in the [[PZH_Admin|PZH Administration]] section.

### Platform Synchronisation

The PZH allows for synchronisation:"http://dev.webinos.org/redmine/projects/wp3-3/wiki/Synchronisation" between PZPs. It does synchronisation of certificates, policies and settings. The synchronisation of items is bi-directional i.e., PZPs can update the PZH with changes to synchronised items as well as the PZH making changes to PZPs.

[andrÃ©] add reference to synchronization section.

[habib] done

Client and Server TLS connection
--------------------------------

The PZHs have the following client and server TLS connections. The TLS Server is the main entity and it facilitates communication between the personal zones.

### TLS Servers on the PZH

[andrÃ©] why is port 80 mandatory? could be default but i don’t think that we can mandate this. Is this TLS Server on Port 80 the admin interface Web site or something different for connecting devices (or is both on same port?)?

[habib] if we do not mandate 80 then we cannot connect to PZH from PZP. we can faciliate finding PZH via webfinger but not port.

| Port | 80 (Should be consistent, if address changed then PZP will not be able to communication with PZH) |
| Description | Incoming connections from PZPs (zone devices) as well as connections from external (friend) PZHs. |
| Parameters | rejectUnauthorized = true (unauthorized certificate connection is rejected),
 requestCert = true (this is to enable mutual authentication) |
| Trusted certificates | Signed PZP certificates & trusted external (connection) PZH certificates |
|/2. Authentication | Entities with PZH certificates are assumed to be a device within other user’s PZH |
 | Entities with PZP certificates are assumed to be zone devices |

### Outgoing TLS connections on the PZH

| Port | Random Port |
| Description | Outgoing connections to connect external PZHs |
| Parameters | Connecting PZH address |
| Trusted certificates | Just the certificate of the PZH we are contacting. May not be entirely trusted |
|/2. Authentication | The remote party must use the certificate we are expecting |
 | Any incoming data from this connection must be mapped to the user of the PZH we are connecting to. They may not be trusted to do anything other. |

[andrÃ©] i am not an expert in TLS connections but if we are talking here about parameters must then not also the whole message be defined? Or is it part of TLS? How does the message / protocol looks like when using rejectUnauthrized etc parameters?

[habib] it is standard tls interface and that’s why not specified in detailed.

PZH States: incoming connections from enrolled PZPs
---------------------------------------------------

The PZH moves between the following states when PZPs connect, starting with the state "NoPzpsConnected". In this state chart, multiple PZPs may connect to the PZH at any time, with the list of connected PZPs shown in the state "PzpsConnected".

[andrÃ©] i don’t see how this diagrams helps to understand PZHs. What does an implementer of a PZH get from looking into this Figure? Also it looks more implementation dependent. This spec should be about mandatory features and protocols needed to implement these features. The rest is probably implementation specific and must no be specified.

[Habib] this is necessary for getting PZH in the correct states
