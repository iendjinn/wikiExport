Abstract
--------

This area defines in detail how applications are authenticated, signed and certified. It also defines how the runtime constraints placed on applications and how they communicate securely with the PZP and external services.

1 Types of webinos applications
-------------------------------

Because webinos allows for applications running within different renderers and with different levels of certification, we define the following types of application.

Table 1.1 Types of webinos applications
|_.Type |_.Runs in |_.Local / hosted |_.Manifest? |_.Delivered over |_.Installed? |_.Authentication |
| B-A | Browser | Hosted (+ app cache)| Yes | HTTPS | No | TLS certificate, root trusted by browser |
| W-R | Widget renderer | Combination | Yes | File + HTTPS | Yes | Signed widget authenticated by widget processor. ‘Recognised’ as per [WAC]. HTTPS traffic only from recognised origin. |
| W-U | Widget renderer | Combination | Yes | File + HTTPS | Yes | Signed widget, but unrecognised identity [WAC]. HTTPS traffic only from recognised origin. HTTPS traffic authenticated by widget runtime OR connected to same entity as the widget signature. |

B-A is a web Browser based, Authenticated, webinos application. It is hosted by a remote HTTPS server, and runs in a browser. In this way it is similar to a traditional hosted application. The difference is that it MUST be delivered over HTTPS.

W-R and W-U stand for signed webinos Widgets, whose identity is Recognised or Unrecognised.

All applications must have a manifest file corresponding to the webinos specifications. This includes applications hosted in a web browser.

Missing: How do browser-based apps get hold of and interpret the manifest?

2 Widget installation and browser-based application registration
----------------------------------------------------------------

All applications MUST be installed on a device before they can be used.

Missing: How do browser-based apps get installed?

Applications may be installed by users, by device manufacturers shipping webinos, or as part of the webinos installation as bundled by webinos developers. "Installation" refers to copying a application to a local device and the registration of the application with the webinos framework on device. In this section only installation by users after the platform has been installed is described. This specification does not describe where applications may come from.

The installation of an application is the time when a trust decision must be made. If the application is not trusted, it should not be installed. If there is doubt about the provenance of the application - whether it is from the right source and has the right name - it should also not be installed. The following steps are taken from [WAC] and modified for the webinos install process:

### 2.1 Widget installation steps

1.  A new widget is downloaded
2.  The widget contains at least one digital signature file containing signatures of all files in the downloaded widget which are not themselves signature files [WidgetSignatures]. The widget will also contain a manifest.
3.  Signatures are verified against the signing key and content of the widget, as per [WidgetSignatures]. Widget signatures MUST contain at least one Transform element (this is a change from the WidgetSignatures specification).
4.  Webinos will check to see which of the signing authorities that were used to sign the application have certificates with roots in those installed in the platform.
5.  The user will be informed if none of the signing authorities are trusted by the platform and advised not to use the widget. A policy MAY exist preventing the installation of such a widget.
6.  Standard widget security and privacy control checks and authorisation. These include:
    1.  Checking the policy.xml to see if the action of installing this widget is permitted.
    2.  Prompting the user that installation of the widget will take place
    3.  Showing the user the permissions requested (defined in "feature" tags) and allowing them to make changes to these permissions.
    4.  Adding the widget to the list of ‘installed widgets’ stored by the PZP
    5.  Adding the widget code to the file system in the pre-defined location
    6.  Creating policy rules defining the permissions this widget is allowed to have

An example UI is shown below. This is not implemented but explains the expectation for how an install screen might look.

![]({width:600px}Permissions_phase_II.png)
The above image is not normative: it describes a potential UI but conforming implementations of this specification may have different UIs.

Each permission will be displayed under the API requested. The text below each API will be machine-generated based on the features requested (e.g. which File permission - read or write) and the obligations and data handling policy defined in the "Privacy Policy" section of the webinos specifications.

The install screen UI _shall_ by default only display features being requested by applications.

The default setting for permission requests _shall_ be set based on a configuration file on the local platform - `default_permission_settings.xml`. This configuration file will have the same format as the access control policies, but is only processed to set defaults for the installation screen. If there is a conflict between the `<feature>`s requested by a application and the default permissions, defined as where default permissions state ‘denied’ but the feature is requested, this shall be flagged visually by the installation GUI. The installer MAY set the default (in this instance) to an ask-at-runtime prompt. The aim is that, should user ‘click through’ without changing anything on this form, the application will receive the default permissions defined by the platform rather than those requested by the application.

The result of the install screen UI will be additional XACML policies stored in the policy.xml file.

Applications may refer to remote content, such as through importing JavaScript in _<script src="http://example.com/myjs.js" />_ statements. This is a potential attack vector unless the content is accessed securely and is served from the recognised origin or an origin defined in the manifest. The script "src" MUST point to a HTTPS location, with certificate trusted by the webinos runtime. A script being loaded from other locations will not be allowed.

All applications must have signed manifests, but they may be signed by keys with self-signed certificates. User policies will dictate whether this is supported by the runtime. The PZP must store the association between the application and its certificate, and a different self-signed certificate cannot be used for subsequent versions of the application.

### 2.2 Use of a B-A application

Browser-based webinos applications are rendered in the same way as web pages. B-A applications can access webinos IF they are served from an origin with scheme HTTPS and the user registers them with the browser. The registration process will be triggered by the B-A attempting to use webinos APIs for the first time. When this happens, the B-A will create a WebSocket request to the PZP and pass with it the origin of the B-A. This is in accordance with the WebSocket specifications. The origin is the identity of the application and MUST be stored by the webinos runtime and used in webinos policies.

After the B-A is registered and first used, a web cache MAY store a copy of the B-A locally with the webinos platform. The previously used application functionality MAY be used offline in the case of the B-A origin is unavailable.

If the user does not register the B-A with the local webinos platform, subsequent attempts to use webinos will be ignored. The decision to not register a B-A therefore effectively blacklists it. This decision must be revocable through a PZP-provided UI.

When the PZP gets the ID of the B-A, which is the web origin, it MAY attempt to check the validity of the certificate of that domain where the B-A comes from to check that the certificate is trusted by a set of root authorities installed in the PZP, which are likely to mirror those in the browser.

Upon registration, the webinos platform shall create a new set of policies based on the recommendations outlined in the Security Framework [D36] for the application type. A prompt shall appear showing this information to the end user, as defined in the policy specification [Policy]. This prompt will allow such a policy to be edited in some respects.

### 2.3 Implications of widget installation and B-A registration

Installing a widget and registering a B-A imply that the entire Personal Zone may be aware that the application has been available for use. As per the policy specifications, registration of an application will result in the synchronisation of application manifests and policies to all Personal Zone devices.

3 Update of widgets and widget signatures
-----------------------------------------

Widgets can be updated by following proposals described in the W3C Widget Update Working Draft [WidgetUpdates]. Remotely hosted contents loaded by a widget and B-A applications require no special mechanism to be updated.

4 Revocation and management of widget signatures
------------------------------------------------

The webinos application security framework relies upon valid certificates being used and the webinos runtime containing a set of trusted certificates, much like a web browser. Webinos must periodically (as well as when the certificate is first installed) check each certificate is valid, and use OCSP to check that it has not been revoked. This task should be performed to the PZH, which can make the necessary updates and synchronise them between all user devices.

5 Application communication with the PZP
----------------------------------------

Webinos applications will communicate with the PZP in different ways depending on the application type and the platform.

Table 5.1 webinos application communication with PZP on different platforms
| Platform | B-A applications | Widgets |
| Android | Web socket | Android IPC |
| Windows | Web socket | Web socket |
| Linux | Web socket | TBC |

All platforms will inject the webinos.js script in some way to allow applications to access webinos APIs.

### 5.1 WebSocket

The PZP will create a secure WebSocket server on localhost which should only accept connections from local entities.

The secure WebSocket server SHALL use the certificates defined in the Personal Zone Key Infrastructure documentation.

WebSockets SHALL request client certificates and SHALL reject unauthenticated connections. Each widget renderer SHALL therefore contain a valid certificate issued by the PZP. Installation of this certificate is a platform and renderer specific process.

### 5.2 Widget renderer communication

A widget renderer may communicate with the PZP through either the Web Socket mechanism given above, or through a native IPC mechanism. The IPC mechanism SHALL protect the integrity and confidentiality of communications and SHALL provide a means to authenticate the PZP and renderer.

6 Application communication with external services
--------------------------------------------------

Outside of webinos, application can communicate with external entities in a number of ways, including:

-   XmlHttpRequest (XHR)
-   Get/Set from form fields, hyperlinks, image insertion
-   postMessage()
-   WebSockets to external entities
-   Cookies set by subdomains
-   Third party plugins, add-ons and browser extensions

A valid widget render will not enable extensions while webinos applications are running.

To avoid the security and privacy implications of some of these mechanisms, the following policies are used in widget renderers.

### 6.1 CSP restrictions

By default, downloaded widgets will have the following Content Security Policies enforced:

<pre>
 default-src ‘none’;
 script-src ‘self’;
 object-src ‘self’;
 style-src ‘self’;
 frame-src ‘self’;
 font-src ‘self’;
 img-src **;
 media-src**;
 connect-src ‘self’ ws://localhost:<webinosport>
</pre>

where webinosport refers to the WebSocket port connection to the PZP. When WebSockets are not used to connect to the PZP, this can be removed.

B-A applications are the same, but with the following changes:

<pre>
 default-src ‘none’;
 script-src ‘self’ [the hosted-origin value];
 object-src ‘self’ [the hosted-origin value];
 style-src ‘self’ [the hosted-origin value];
 frame-src ‘self’ [the hosted-origin value];
 font-src ‘self’ [the hosted-origin value];
 img-src **;
 media-src**;
 connect-src ‘self’ ws://localhost:[webinosport] [the hosted-origin value]
</pre>

Where [the hosted-origin value] is given in the `feature` tag in the manifest for the `http://webinos.org/feature/internet` permission.

Widgets MAY specify additional CSP restrictions for img-src, media-src and connect-src via the `feature` tag in the manifest. For example:

<pre><code class="xml">
<feature name="http://webinos.org/feature/internet">
 <param name="csp-img-src" value="http://www.foo.com"/>
 <param name="csp-media-src" value="http://www.bar.com"/>
 <param name="csp-connect-src" value="http://www.remote-service.com"/>
 <param name="hosted-origin" value="https://www.example.com" />
 <param name="hosted-page-uri" value="https://www.example.com/index.html" />
 <param name="hosted-page-uri" value="https://www.example.com/style.css" />
 <param name="hosted-page-uri" value="https://www.example.com/main.js" />
</feature>
</code></pre>

The values given in `csp-img-src` and `csp-media-src` will _overwrite_ the default. The values given in `connect-src` will _append_ to the default value.

Hosted widgets MAY specify CSP restrictions in HTTP headers. These headers will overwrite any headers specified in the _manifest_ but not the defaults specified here.

Because these CSP directives are applied, this means that the following is not permitted in webinos widgets:

1.  Eval and other text-to-javascript functions
2.  Inline JavaScript

### 6.2 Cross Origin Resource Sharing (CORS)

The webinos application renderer SHALL enforce any Cross Origin Resource Sharing [CORS] headers received as part of HTTP responses to widgets. If present, CORS headers SHALL take precedence over the "csp-connect-src" string.

For example, a widget which has requested the "http://webinos.org/feature/internet" feature using the example tag in section 6 would usually be able to make an XmlHttpRequest to http://www.remote-service.com. However, if http://www.remote-service.com returned a CORS header containing "access-control-allow-origin: …." which _does not_ include the "hosted-origin" of the widget or the recognised origin of a local widget the the request SHALL NOT be served, in line with CORS specifications.

7 Feature Strings
