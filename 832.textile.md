Secure Storage
--------------

### Introduction

This section describes conceptual components and threats for securely storing data in the PZP/PZH. PZP data will be stored locally on the device and, for PZHs, will be stored in the cloud. Data on both nodes need to be secured and managed from all threats. The information related to user identities, key, certificates and password are the one that need to be guaranteed most of secure storage in the webinos platform.

Functional aspects relating to storage are illustrated in Deliverable 2.1. In some scenarios, it is explicitly mentioned and, in some cases, assumed that storage is secure during the event flows. The section below highlights the relevant use cases and user stories.

The API’s required for accessing this section are expected to be covered in Phase 2. The components defined in this section are recommendations and could be considered during platform implementation.

* User friendâ€™s list and device information
* Atomicity of data if updated via user or personal hub based on synchronization techniques.
* If device is shared between multiple users, then storage should not be accessible to other user.
* Context data and analytics data
* Network storage and photo storage that user uses to store data in cloud.

### Components

Two most important aspects of storage are file system and key exchange between devices. File system security is controlled via access control list and encryption mechanism used to control different file system area. Key exchange is more about private key and synchronization between PZP and PZH.

#### Encrypted file system

Traditionally file systems are hierarchically structured stored in the form of trees. Based on the tree structure, access to different areas is controlled by access list control mechanism. To be secure, webinos should aim to provide both access control and encryption mechanisms.

webinos sits on top of underlying OS and the area of the memory available should be access controlled depending on user and application usage. Suggested levels of access control to webinos memory area:
* Unsecured (but still not public): Any application can use this memory location where data stored is not required to be secured. External user will not be able to access this memory location but memory area will not be encrypted.
* App-specific secure storage: Context data related to the application, data collected as part of analytics or any other application data can use this storage area. Data security in this section is application responsibility. This storage should not allow someone scanning memory to collect application collected data. The encryption mechanism that application developer can use to secure storage in this area will be based on Security Cryptography API’s.
* Webinos platform secure storage: Storage area to store XACML policies, user credentials, keys and password. The security for this area should be highly secured and access to this area should be user credential control. The cryptographic mechanism used will be highly secure, and the webinos platform is responsible for secure data storage.

The file system architecture implementation is dependent on the underlying OS and device. Depending on the implementation, the access control mechanism and encryption specific support to different memory area should be supported.

#### Key Exchange and Synchronization

Keys and certificates stored in PZP need to be exchanged with PZH. As part of authentication, keys are exchanged based on a public / private key mechanism. Private keys that will be used will be securely stored locally in user devices. Sending devices will send public keys and user details that a private key can use to decrypt key data. More details about the private and public key usage are specified in "Authentication Specification":http://dev.webinos.org/redmine/projects/wp3-1/wiki/Spec_-_Authentication.

PZH will act as a point for storing relevant data securely for each device. Synchronization needs to take place when a device connects to PZH or when there is some context data. As part of webinos platform, secure storage, certificate or password information might need to be updated between PZP and PZH.

In order to support webinos, the platform shall guarantee that device exchanging details are connected securely over TLS, and the user is securely authenticated with the device. All the data exchanged will be encrypted using cryptographic mechanism used while authenticating.

### Security and privacy issues

Some of the identified security issues and solutions for secure storage are listed below:
* Loss/Forgotten Keys: In public private key infrastructure, the user’s private key plays an important role for authenticating. If a user loses or forgets this key then the user will have problem authenticating with webino. To handle this, webinos should support a forgetten key retrieval mechanism such as the use of mobile phones to retrieve password, or PINs sent via SMS to generate new password.
* Hardware attacks: Lost devices should not diverge user identities, password and certificates. To support this, webinos platform will require user authentication with device and shall provide cloud based service to revoke password and certificate stored in this device. Access to secure storage will require credentials.
* Synchronisation to device with lower encryption capabilities: In case devices authenticate with the lower encryption supported devices, these need to guarantee that data exchange supports a minimum of Digest-MD5 encryption capability.

### Future directions

The second phase of webinos development will consider further secure storage issues. An important feature requiring more work is the revocation of keys used for encrypted storage. In particular, corporate use cases require the removal of confidential company data if the device is lost or stolen. Many existing mobile phones contain this capability, including Android and RIM, and webinos could provide this on other devices such as TVs and cars which may otherwise be forgotten.

A further issue is the policies governing the synchronisation of confidential data. In some cases, applications may want the ability to synchronise their data store between user devices. However, some data may be marked so that it is not shared with less-secure devices. Furthermore, synchronisation policies may govern exactly how some data is allowed to be stored on each device (e.g. encrypted, using secure hardware).

Digital Rights Management is another capability we would like to expose to webinos applications, and the best way of doing so should be included in phase two of the deliverable to satisfy several ecosystem requirements.

Finally, we would like to take advantage of the hardware-based cryptography which exists on some platforms (e.g. the Trusted Platform Module on the PC) to provide hardware-backed secure storage. This would allow the device to protect itself from the loss of data even when malicious software is present or a custom ROM is installed. It would also increase the security available for a digital rights management system.
