### Related Security and Privacy Architectures in Industry

This page summarises the main related work in industry on mobile web application security and privacy, as well as some summaries of how this has affected webinos design.

#### Web Application Systems

##### WAC and BONDI Security architectures

-   WAC Core Specification: Security and Privacy ([[D036_References#WAC|WAC]])
-   OMTP App Security Framework ([[D036_References#OMTP|OMTP]])

From WAC we borrow much of the widget handling specifications and installation behaviour with regards to signatures and identities. The webinos policy architecture is also based on the WAC approach, but with modifications for cross-platform flows and privacy.

##### Google Chrome

-   Hosted Applications Documentation ([[D036_References#ChromeHosted|ChromeHosted]])
-   Chrome User Identification ([[D036_References#ChromeUserId|ChromeUserId]])
-   Packaged Apps - Disabled Web Features ([[D036_References#ChromePackaged|ChromePackaged]])
-   Chrome Manifests ([[D036_References#ChromeManifest|ChromeManifest]])
-   Chrome CSP for Packaged Apps ([[D036_References#ChromeCSP|ChromeCSP]])
-   Chrome API Permission Warnings ([[D036_References#ChromePermission|ChromePermission]])

From these references we intend to follow recommendations on limitations to javascript within web applications, such that inline javascript and ‘eval’ statements are not permitted.

##### Boot2Gecko / FirefoxOS / OpenWebDevice and Mozilla Web APIs

-   Boot 2 Gecko Runtime Security ([[D036_References#B2GRuntimeSec|B2GRuntimeSec]])
-   Boot 2 Gecko App Security ([[D036_References#B2GAppSec|B2GAppSec]])
-   Boot 2 Gecko App Security Model Discussion ([[D036_References#B2GAppSecDis|B2GAppSecDis]])
-   Application Manifest format for Open Web Applications ([[D036_References#MozillaAppManifest|MozillaAppManifest]])
-   Mozilla Web APIs ([[D036_References#MozillaWebApi|MozillaWebApi]])

##### Recommendations and specifications on web privacy from the W3C and IETF

-   Patterns for Privacy by Design in Javascript ([[D036_References#W3CPatternsPriv|W3CPatternsPriv]])
-   Report from the Internet Privacy Workshop ([[D036_References#rfc6462|rfc6462]])
-   Privacy Considerations for Internet Protocols ([[D036_References#Draft-iab-priv|Draft-iab-priv]])
-   Do Not Track: A Universal Third-Party Web Tracking Opt Out ([[D036_References#DoNotTrack|DoNotTrack]])

Based on these guidelines, we intend to try and avoid introducing APIs which allow for fingerprinting without any form of user consent. I.e., web applications should not be able to gain additional information about a user, or any form of user identity, unless the policy architecture allows it. We also intend to make information flows more visible to users by encouraging developers to explain their data handling policies when requesting data.

##### Security analysis by ENISA

We focus on one of the recommendations given by ENISA in their report ([[D036_References#ENISA2011|ENISA2011]]) - End User Policing. From the report:

> Several specifications depend on the end user to ensure security, typically by means of a permission system. With the rapid development of new APIs offering new functionality, this approach is reaching its limits. Typical web users are unable to assess the ramifications of granting certain permissions to certain origins. Additionally, involving the user too often might quickly lead to blindly approving permissions.
> A first recommendation is to require an awareness indicator, so the user knows when a site is using a granted permission (e.g. when a site is locating the user). Currently, this is only included as a suggestion in the Geo-location API and is missing from other APIs, such as the System Information API.
> A second recommendation is to offer the users a way to select predefined security profiles or to create a security profile (e.g. by means of a wizard, which could explain the ramifications of sharing your location and then provide the option to allow this or not.). Once a security profile is chosen, it is used to determine the appropriate actions when a site requests permission for an action.

##### Web intents

An analysis of web intents security issues can be found in the D3.4 deliverable.

#### Mobile application security and privacy frameworks

While the following projects are less directly applicable, they provide an important context for webinos applications. In particular, we borrow concepts from the Android permission system.

##### Android

-   Android Security Overview ([[D036_References#AndroidSecurityOverview|AndroidSecurityOverview]])
-   Security Enhanced Android ([[D036_References#SEAndroid|SEAndroid]])

##### iOS

-   iOS Security ([[D036_References#AppleIosSec|AppleIosSec]])

##### Chromium OS

-   Chromium OS Security Overview ([[D036_References#ChromiumSec|ChromiumSec]])

##### Meego security architecture

-   The Meego Security Architecture ([[D036_References#MeegoSec|MeegoSec]])

##### Tizen security architecture

-   Security Overview Presentation ([[D036_References#TizenSec|TizenSec]])
-   Application installation and Manifest ([[D036_References#TizenManifest|TizenManifest]])

#### Summary

The webinos security framework is informed by all of the sources given above. In particular, we make use of recommendations from WAC, Chrome, W3C and ENISA to try and avoid threats that they have identified.
