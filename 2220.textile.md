PZH Deployment
==============

{{toc}}

Introduction
------------

A PZH in webinos is an entity that is always addressable over public IP network. Typical services it provides are certificate signing, synchronising, policy enforcement, and establish connections between different devices and other Personal Zones. In this section we cover about the PZH deployment options, current implementation details, deployment details of PZH and PZH component diagram.

Deployment Options
------------------

There are several implementation options for the PZH, many of which have different profiles with respect to security and privacy. In this section we will outline some of the options for those designing the architecture of a particular PZH or PZH provider.

### Monolithic PZH Provider

The approach taken in the webinos implementation is to create a single process - a PZH Provider - which creates multiple conceptual PZHs. The provider component contains capabilities for:

-   TLS server for PZP and external PZH connections
-   Routing
-   Certificate management - issuing, revoking certificates, enrol devices
-   Policy enforcement
-   Synchronisation of core files (policy, certificates)

Further features can be provided by cloud based PZP’s, which are the same as normal PZP’s but are hosted as online services rather than on physical end-user devices. The aim of such PZP’s are to provide services such as context database.

### Virtualised PZH

Another approach to PZH deployment is the creation of a single piece of server software offering just one PZH. This platform can then run as a virtual machine, with one virtual machine per person. In this model, each PZH is a self-contained system with its own copy of the common functionality provided by the webinos runtime. This style allows the PZH to be easily provisioned, since copies of pre-configured PZHs can easily be maintained and instantiated when needed. Furthermore, migration features provided in a virtualised environment would enable users to easily switch between PZH providers.

This style offers two approaches for enriching the functionality provided by the PZH: paired VMs and VM patching. In a paired VM approach, new services are deployed as virtual machines, similar to the way the PZH is deployed. The service VMs are then paired with the PZH instance to ensure that the two can work together in a secure manner. In the VM patching approach, new services are added to the PZH by either patching the PZH instance or installing new software on the PZH VM. The former can be considered a "virtualised microkernel approach" and the latter a "virtualised monolithic approach"

### Microkernel-style PZH

The final approach is the definition of a PZH as a set of distributed communicating services based around a single "kernel", analogous to a microkernel operating system. In this model, the PZH core entity has the following features:

-   TLS server for PZP and external PZH connections
-   Routing
-   Policy enforcement
-   Synchronisation of core files (policy, certificates)

Other services can be provided by entirely independent service providers

-   Certificate management - issuing, revoking certificates, enrolling devices

This can effectively be offered by another "virtual" PZP or a similar service. The advantage to this approach is that this service can be more securely implemented. This service might also be contained within one device owned by the end user, rather than an online service.

-   Synchronised application storage

This can be implemented on a separate file store and be made accessible to the PZH when necessary.

-   Context storage

This can be implemented on a separate file store and provide message-level encryption for incoming context data.

Current Implementation of PZH
-----------------------------

The "current PZH implementation":https://github.com/habibvirji/Webinos-Platform/tree/v0.6.0 is based on a monolithic PZH provider approach. In the implementation cycle, the first implementation was a Virtualised Monolithic PZH but was later updated to run as Monolithic PZH provider. This section does not mandate implementing PZH as a monolithic PZH but shows implementation details of the current implementation.

### Monolithic PZH provider

A Monolithic PZH provider includes multiple PZH’s in one process. The reason for this implementation was each PZH requires its own port. This leads to the problem of a PZP knowing on which port PZH is running currently. Dedicating a complete virtual machine is not required as a single instance of the PZH does not have a high traffic load and does not perform server side request handling for APIs. The Monolithic PZH provider approach allows multiple PZH’s each capable of running in their own context and using separate certificates to run at one IP address and port.

The Monolithic PZH provider is the actual TLS server which forwards request to the PZH instance when any request comes. It does not perform any activity of its own. The current service hosted at pzh.webinos.org is running as a Monolithic PZH.

Each PZH connection is differentiated based on the servername, the URI of the PZH, which the PZP sends in its TLS connection request. If the TLS connection has the proper certificate corresponding to the provided servername then the connection is accepted or else the connection is rejected. It mandates that the PZP knows its PZH address, otherwise a connection is not possible.

In order for each PZH to run with its own certificate, SNI (Server Name Indication) mechanism is used. SNI enables each PZH to have a separate certificate but run on the same IP number and port number. This allows Monolithic PZH to host multiple PZHs but each running with its own certificate.

The Monolithic PZH is also responsible for initializing a web server. The web server provides users to login via OpenId credentials. After successful login, the web server loads the respective PZH Administration page for the PZH owner. The web server differentiates PZH’s based on the authentication information provided by the OpenId provider. For example: If user A authenticates via OpenId provider example.org, after authentication a@example.org is the identity of PZH used by web server to load PZH administration for the PZH owner.

#### Monolithic PZH provider initialization

The Monolithic PZH provider should be running in the cloud or on a publicly accessible IP address. Information about the PZH providers should be provided as REST service on a trusted source. The PZP before enrollment connects to the trusted source to fetch a white list of the available PZH provider hostnames. A hostname is resolved to the correspondingIP address before connecting. The publicly accessible IP address if used for PZH provider, there is no mechanism to fetch this information. It is assumed the user who does not use white listed PZH provider know about the PZH provider IP address.

The Monolithic PZH provider initialization involves creating a connection, master certificate, and private key. This master certificate should be signed by a trusted authority. These certificates are loaded for initializing the TLS server. The TLS server runs at port 80 and address "0.0.0.0".

Once the Monolithic PZH provider is up and running, it loads all existing enrolled PZH’s. Then it initializes a web server with the certificates signed from the trusted authority. The web server certificate is tied with the provider address such as example.org. Once certificates are made available then it is started at address "0.0.0.0" and run at 443 port.

#### PZH Creation

The Monolithic PZH provider functionality is broken into functionality provided through the web server and functionality provided by a TLS server. The enrolment task for PZH and PZP are handled in the web server.

The PZH can be created via the PZH provider’s web server. The user can login to their choice of the OpenId provider, once authenticated if certificates are not present they are created. These certificates are then added in the SNI context of the PZH provider running. In case certificates are already present, they are already loaded in the SNI context and do not need to be reloaded. If PZH provider has to be restarted it loads PZH certificate in SNI context.

The PZP connecting at PZH provider are differentiated based on the servername. The Servername should match with the name used in the SNI context.

#### PZP Enrolment

The enrolment mechanism allows the PZP to become part of the personal zone. The end results of the enrollment are a set of certificates that the PZP gets from the PZH. These certificates allows the PZP to connect with the PZH TLS server and communicate with other personal zone PZP’s.

The enrollment mechanism is done through the PZH provider web server. The user initializes a PZP which has not been enrolled in any personal zone. It enables option of the "Connect to PZH", this triggers fetching a white list of the PZH provider. The user can select the PZH provider or enter an hostname or IP address where the PZH provider is hosted. The login page is fetched from the user’s selected PZH provider web server. This login page should provide user with options to select an OpenId provider. The user is authenticated through the selected OpenId provider. The OpenId provider redirects to the PZH provider web server if successfully authenticated. The OpenId provider also provides information about the user such as name, country and email id. This information is then used to formulate identity for the PZH.

The PZH provider web server then redirects back to the PZP from where request originated along with information whether the PZH exists, the PZH identity based on the information provided by OpenId provider, and the authentication token. The PZP on receiving of authentication response gets the user consent about enrolment of the PZP. If the user consents to create the PZP at the mentioned PZH, the PZP sends the CSR (certificate sign request) and authentication token to the PZH provider web server.

The PZH provider forwards to request to the PZH. The PZH validates the authentication token, if it matches a signed certificate is generated. The PZH provider is agnostic to the enrolment process; it just forwards all received requests to the respective PZH. All communication with the PZH provider is based on the details fetched through OpenId provider.

#### PZP Revoke

The user can revoke the PZP that it does not want to be part of the personal zone. The PZP revoke can be done from the PZH Admin page. This functionality is handled in the PZH provider web server.

The user can select the option for revoking device through the PZH administration page. Revoke device will present list of the PZP that are enrolled in the personal zone. The user can select the PZP they want to revoke, on selection the PZP identity is sent to the PZH. The PZH then using certificate manager generates a new CRL. The CRL contains information about the PZP certificate signature details that has been revoked. Generated CRL is then synchronised across personal zones using the PZH TLS Server.

The PZP that has been revoked cannot connect to PZH, the personal zone PZP’s and the trusted other zone’s PZH. The PZP revoke could also involve remote wipe of details. If revoked PZP connects to PZH, it gets certificate revoked event and remote wipe event. On receipt of this event, the PZP deletes all the personal data.

#### PZH - PZH connection

A PZH to PZH connection involves the PZH authenticating each other and exchanging certificates. The connecting process is initiated via user using PZH web server. To find another PZH, web finger along with other user email id can be used or else if user knows the PZH url they can enter directly.

The PZH URL includes information about the PZH provider. The PZH provider details are resolved and request for the certificate exchange is requested for a particular PZH is requested. Details about the authentication steps are covered in "PKI":http://dev.webinos.org/redmine/projects/wp3-3/wiki/Personal_Zone_Key_Infrastructure.

The PZH authentication is a binary process involving both parties to validate each other. Once they agree, the respective master certificates of the PZH’s are exchanged. On completion of certificate exchange, PZH that initiated request connects to another PZH TLS server. Since both ends have proper master certificates to validate connection certificate, connection is accepted.

The PZHs synchronises certificates across the PZP’s. These allow the PZPs to communicate with other zone devices when the PZH is not reachable.

### Session Manager

The Session manager initializes the PZH Provider, PZH, The Messaging Manager, and The Policy Manager. The main entities of session manager are the TLS server and the web server. The server performs different set of functionality respectively and was covered in previous section in more detail.

The Session Manager does device authentication using certificate manager. Certificate manager is responsible to generate and verify for the session manager. Session manager interaction with the certificate manager is during device enrolment and device connection.

The Session Manager is responsible for loading configuration details for PZH when it starts. It stores PZH details for persistent purpose and uses the information during connection and during import and export.

Physical storage of configuration detail differs on different platforms. To support multiple different platforms, The Session Manager creates the webinosRoot at the following locations:

|Platform |Path|
|Linux | $HOME/.webinos|
|Windows | %appdata%/webinos|
|MAC OS | $HOME/.webinos|
|Android | /External_Storage/.webinos|

Inside webinosRoot, for each PZH it creates a directory based on user name. Inside this folder it creates below listed file and directories. The structure is important as based on this structure synchronisation is performed.

  ----------------------------- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Path                          Content
  /pzh.json                     This file contains information about PZH.
  /devicelist.json              This file contains the list of known devices and users
  /crl.pem                      This file contains the certificate revocation list
  /policies/                    This folder contains all XACML policy files
  /policies/manifest/           This folder contains application manifest file
  /policies/exception/          This folder contains exceptions that should not be synchronised across devices
  /certificates/external/       This folder contains certificate files referring to other users’ PZHs and PZPs
  /certificates/internal/pzp/   This folder contains certificate files referring to the user’s own PZPs
  /certificates/internal/pzh/   This folder contains certificate files referring to the user’s own PZH
  /userdata/                    This folder contains any other user profile data and preferences
  ----------------------------- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Synchronisation Manager is invoked by the Session Manager when PZP or PZH connects. The Synchronisation Manager scans above directories and if there are any differences send updates to PZP.

The Messaging Manager is initialized along with session manager. The Messaging Manager is needed for routing packets inside the personal zone and for communicating with service discovery manager. In order to work along with the messaging manager, register message is exchanged with information about the session identity.

The Service Discovery Manager is supported at PZH to hold service information for various PZP’s and connected PZH. The PZP when it connects sends list of registered services. All this information is hold in service discovery manager. The PZP searching for service queries PZH to get list of current services available.

The Policy Manager works along with the Session Manager to allow or deny connection request or a service request.

The Session Manager is implemented purely in JavaScript and uses several nodejs modules.

### Certificate Manager

The Certificate manager generates set of certificates and key. Various certificate and keys generated are:

1.  PZH master key: A master private key of PZH, this key should be protected and not exchanged outside PZH.
2.  PZH master CA certificate: This is the PZH master certificate and contains public key. This certificate is exchanged across personal zone. In PZH deployment, this certificate should be signed by a trusted authority.
3.  PZH connection key: The connection key is associated with the connection certificate; this is a private key and should be properly protected.
4.  PZH connection certificate: PZH uses these certificate for TLS server, these certificate are signed using PZH master key and master CA certificate.
5.  PZH web server certificate: PZH web server certificate are not generated for each PZH but instead they are generated only for the PZH provider. This certificate should be signed by trusted authority and is associated with provider address.
6.  PZP certificate: PZP enrolling at PZH are signed using PZH master CA certificate and master key.

Other functionality it providers includes checking of certificate signature to validate if the certificate is from the trusted source. This is performed when PZP tries to connect PZH.

The Certificate manager is implemented in native code C++ using OpenSSL library.

### Synchronisation

The Synchronisation Manager works in tandem with session manager. When a PZP or PZH connect to the personal zone, it synchronises contents of the directories presented in session manager section.

The main items to synchronise are certificates and policy files. The items selected are based on policy files and user preferences.

During first time connect of PZP, all available information is sent from PZH to PZP. In subsequent connections, it uses the rsync algorithm to synchronise only changed sections.

The synchronisation implementation is in JavaScript and is based on the rsync algorithm.

### Messaging & Routing

The Messaging Manager supports functionality for routing, support for event API and service discovery API. The Messaging Manager allows storing and forwarding of messages inside the personal zone and to the devices outside personal zone.

Messaging relies on the Session Manager for two endpoints to be connected. Endpoints once connect register with the Messaging Manager with their identity. This identity is used by messaging to route packets.

It supports communication with two APIs:
# Event API: Event API supports PZPs to subscribe for events across personal zone at PZH. PZH then publishes event information across devices as they are available.
# Service Discovery API: Services hosted on PZP are updated at PZH to enable them being searchable across personal zone. Messaging interacts with the service discovery manager to allow PZPs to register service and allow other PZP’s to search those services.

### Policy Manager

The Policy Manager is a policy enforcer in PZH. It provides three types of action: one time allows, defaults allow, and default deny. Depending on the policies, a particular action can be performed in the policy manager.

It works along with the Session Manager to decide whether to accept connection from the particular source. Session manager relies on policy manager in particular for connection outside personal zone. For example: if user A has been allowed to access device A but not device B. This kind of restriction can be done via policy manager.

The Policy Manager works along with messaging manager to handle service invocation request. The services are checked if they are available and if they can be accessed by the request originator.
