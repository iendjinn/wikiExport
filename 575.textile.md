Access to APIs on remote devices
================================

Problem definition
------------------

The general problem we have to solve is:

â€œHow to provide a consistent way for web applications to access userâ€™s resources or any other resources hosted anywhere, i.e. in userâ€™s current device, in another device connected through the network, at a network server, or in a locally connected device.â€

The problem has two major parts:

-   Service Discovery
-   Access to the service

So this involves not only WP 3.2 but also WP 3.1 for example Discovery, Communication, Event handling and Overlay networking sub tasks.

A example use case illustrating this issue is:

_A web application running in a TV needs access to a camera and the user selects to use her mobile phone camera._

Brainstorming and proposals
---------------------------

### Proposal 1: Only local API access to Device Features

As of the requirements, user stories and use cases, webinos has to provide means to push code from one device to another one in order to execute the code remotely. This could be also used as means to access device features remotely.

**Two illustrating examples for code outsourcing:**

1 Smart Text Input:
`Using a smartphone as text input device for applications running on a TV set. Here, the smart phone not only sends key-codes to the â€œmainâ€ application, it also shows some appropriate forms in order to support the text input. In addition, the outsourced code running on the smartphone may check the text input in order to prevent sending of unnecessary or incorrect data to the â€œmainâ€ application.`

2 Smart sensors:
`Assuming an application wants to be informed when remotely available sensor data (real sensor or any another webinos enable/compatible device) crosses a specific threshold. The application could check periodically the actual value and take some action based on this. Since this would produce unnecessary traffic and needs the primary application to run continously,  it would be better to only get a sensor event if the threshold  is reached. To achieve this, the application may outsource a piece of code to the desired sensor or device. The code locally checks the sensor/requested data until the threshold  is reached. The outsourced code informs the â€œmainâ€ application via an eventing system about this so that the application can take their specific actions.`

Since we have to provide code outsourcing anyway, we can use this concept to access remotely available device resources. The application which needs access to a device feature requests a webinos code outsourcing component to send code or the whole application to devices which provide the needed features, using a webinos discovery API (or even to all devices and filter locally).
After code was deployed (permanent installation or one-time execution) on the target devices it is automatically (depends on the applied security mechanism) executed and accesses the local device features via the provided JavaScript APIs. After doing the work and if needed (depends on the actual executed code) results could be sent back to the â€œmainâ€ application via a webinos event API (alternatively direct stream-able communication mechanisms via socket or http APIs could be provided).

**How could this look like for a developer in pseudo code:**

//find devices which have a display, text input capabilities and a geo-location provider
WebinosDevices devices = webinos.findDevices(â€œCapability: Display, TextInput, Geolocationâ€);

//since we may find multiple ones select one to use
WebinosDevice device = selectADeviceToUse(devices);

//request to deploy a widget, here another pre-defined widget located in the widgets resource folder, on the selected device
DeployedCodeInfo info = device.deploy(â€œressourcestextInputWidget.wgtâ€);

//register an event listener to get notifications if the remote application has done its work.
//the actual event listener subscription depends on the webinos eventing system specification
this.addEventlistener(info.Event(â€œtextInputSuccessfullâ€), function (){ //process things on result});

//request to execute the widget if desired (otherwise it is only installed)
info.execute();

On the remote device the application is doing its work, e.g., showing some GUI, allowing the user to enter some text and accessing the deviceâ€™s geo-location. Afterwards notify the parent application about any results.

navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition(onPositionReceived);

function onPositionReceived{
 webinos.eventing.notify(webinos.getContext() .parentApplication, â€textInputSuccessfullâ€);
}

A webinos.getContext() API may be provided by webinos and gives information about the application context. For the here relevant code outsourcing part it could provide information about the parent application, i.e., the application that outsourced the current code, in order to allow to communicate together and to exchange date between both application parts.

### Proposal 2 (Add-on to Proposal 1): Binding remote Features to local JavaScript Objects

Since we have the requirements to outsource code some kind of proposal 1 would be possible in webinos anyway. But in case that forcing developers to actively think about how to access remote features an approach that is a bit more transparent could be used.
The approach is described using the W3C geolocation API which normally can be used calling

navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition();

In this proposal a feature discovery API is provided by webinos which allows finding all available API implementations which could be placed on local or remote devices. For example:

//find all known (and accessible) geolocation providers, no matter on local or remote devices
GeolocationList availableGeolocationImplementations = webinos.discovery.findFeature(Geolocation);

//select one of the found geolocation implementations
Geolocation geolocation = selectAResult(availableGeolocationImplementations);

//use geolocation API from a remote device the same way as it would be used from a local device
geolocation.getCurrentPosition();

In addition the webinos device discovery module may provide information about the device that provides the concrete geolocation implementation.

**Issue Remote Access Protocol:**

We need to define a protocol that is able to communicate JavaScript calls to remote devices in a way that does not need remote API definitions (like REST, WADL, WSDL,â€¦) for each of our JavaScript APIs. Remotely these calls must interpreted and executed and results are sent back to the initial requestor of the API call. From the programming paradigm point of view there is no difference in using a local feature or a remote feature.
The actual requirements on such a protocol must be investigated further. For example, function calls and results must be transmitted between devices. This mostly relates to JavaScript Objects which can be data objects or which may be functions again. Functions must be transparently executed remotely again. In some cases binary data must be transported for a proper remote API call. For example a picture was remotely taken and the result is a file reference. This file reference may be a remote reference but the file could also be transported to the requesting device to be locally available.
