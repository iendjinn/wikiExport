The objectives of webinos analytics
-----------------------------------

The objective of webinos analytics is to help application developers provide and learn more about the application and its users. It is designed for application developers that would like to outsource the analytics task to gain more focus and time to develop the application. Webinos analytics is the process of aggregating reports from application sessions that users have with the applications. Gathering metrics is the process of gathering and making information about the individual application sessions available for the analytics. Conducting metrics is therefore the enabler for providing analytics. Webinos applications must be equipped with webinos metrics components as means to enable the aggregation of webinos analytics. Thus, analytics is the process of aggregating data from the captured metrics data, and performing the analytics on top of the metrics can be seen as a specialised application process.

How does the webinos metrics and analytics work for the application developer and the users? There are many ways one can perform analytics and subsequently many architectures that could be implemented for providing metrics and analytics. For webinos applications, the metric data can either be conducted within the local application on the client side, or alternatively remotely in conjunction to the web site that the applications on the devices communicate with. Webinos offers two different ways to collect the metrics data: within the application on the user device, or remotely on the web site that the application communicates with.

Conducting webinos metrics is quite straight forward. The overall user scenario to keep in mind is:

1.  The user interacts with the application on her device, such as requesting for some content on the web
2.  The application uses some webinos metrics software - either on-device, or on the web
3.  The webinos metrics software collects metrics data about how the application is used
4.  The gathered metrics data is securely sent/uploaded to the analytics service
5.  The analytics service gathers and analyses the metrics data for the application developer
6.  The application developer logs on to the analytics service to see and learn about the application and its users

How to integrate webinos analytics with the application
-------------------------------------------------------

Webinos applications can run across multiple devices and web servers. Much of the communication in a web application is via the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP). The HTTP-protocol is regarded as stateless, because there is no notion of state preserved by the protocol itself. Webinos applications are however not stateless, because the user has to interact with and go through various stages to interact with the application. Any notion of state has therefore to be explicitly gathered and stored somewhere by the web application. This can either happen on the device or on the web site in a webinos application.

The application on the user device sends HTTP-requests to web sites for content, and as part of these web request, it has to provide sufficient context information for the web site to compose and provide the correct response.

The chosen implementation strategy for the webinos analytics is to provide a suite of metrics components that together can cater for the needs of a wide range of web application architectures in need for outsourcing to webinos analytics. For example, it could be an offline application running locally on the device, that connects to the web perhaps once per month, or it could be a web application where several thousand HTML requests and responses travel between the client and various web servers. By addressing both of these, we believe we will able to address most needs for metrics and analytics in web applications, because one can choose to gather the metrics data in the application instance running on the usersâ€™ device, and one could also want to perform some analytics work as light weight workers on the web server side. The work balance for metrics gathering can therefore be shifted towards the online web servers or more towards the client application on the device depending on the analytics requirements of the application.

An important aspect for webinos analytics components is for users and application developers to be able to trust them. Providing for analytics across applications therefore means catering for privacy. It is in general possible to monitor individual interaction with application, but also to aggregate statistics for a set of users. Most analytics approaches today provide aggregated statistics for all users using the web application/ web servers. However, if one places some metrics on the local device, then one can achieve very accurate and also individual statistics. This could be used for an application to provide smarter, and more personalised information experiences. Note however that individual statistics about a user always is personal and sensitive data above all. Storing and using such data requires permission/ consent from the user.

The scope of the webinos metrics components is to be a solution for application developers to be able to plug in and start using webinos analytics.

As with web applications, webinos applications can be built in the following ways:

1.  Client-side application
2.  Client-side and server-side application
3.  Server-side application

The communication between the client and the server will normally be using the hypertext transfer protocol.

Unlike static websites, webinos applications offer a richer experience which can be more integrated with mobile devices, tablets, car infotainment, and laptops. The webinos applications will be able to more context information than previously possible in web applications. It can can capture metrics data about access location, motion, camera, local sensors, networks, near-field communication and so on. The webinos applications will have different session models and, as mentioned will also enable offline use. This means that the scope of collecting metrics in the webinos platform is two-fold:

-   To enable the gathering of metrics data through the use of the context API
-   To enable the gathering of metrics data pertinent to HTTP-requests and responses; including context information around these

Conceptual Architecture
-----------------------

Reading this will help webinos application developers understand the conceptual level of integrating the application with webinos metrics components. An application developer integrates in the same way on any webinos enabled device. This makes it easy to develop and it obtains efficient development, allowing application developers to focus on what the application should do instead of what marketing managers would like to know.

It takes only some minutes to read through this guide to the conceptual architecture, and afterwards you will be able to spend only a few hours to plan what you would like to conduct metrics on, and then you integrate this with your application. It is possible to only read the metrics API specifications to be able to integrate. However, we recommend for every application developer to spend some time to read through this conceptual document in order to know the possibilities before starting to integrate with webinos metrics.

As mentioned, this documentation is independent of the target device that your application will be/ or is running on.

Overall system concepts
-----------------------

Here is some of the core overall system concepts and vocabulary that application developers will need to be aware of when we discuss webinos analytics:

### Webinos application sessions

A webinos application session starts when an application instance starts, and ends when the application instance stops. Each session is uniquely identifiable for your application. Throughout the session there are will be certain points and events that you will be interested in gathering metrics about and analysing.

### Webinos metrics data and metric points

The metrics are chunks of data that you are interested in gathering. This can be about the user context, the device context, the application context, specific events that occur, or contextual information about HTTP-requests and their responses, in your application where you would like to conduct data and metrics. Thus, metrics is context information that captures important aspects of the user, application, and the device. The metric points are the places in your application that you would like the metrics to be conducted.

### Webinos metrics events

A metrics event is created by you at the every chosen metrics point in the application. An interesting event occurs in the application and you as an application developer decide that it is important to log this event. A metrics event contains metrics data. Here are some examples of metrics data that application developers might want to log:

-   The user opens a particular view or page
-   The user changes her profile
-   The user is using different devices
-   The user earns more loyalty points
-   The user checks out and pays for products
-   The user arrives at a new destination
-   The user changes the privacy policy
-   The application presents an advertisement
-   The user sends a new HTTP request
-   The application receives a HTTP response
-   The application crashes
-   The device goes off-line
-   The device goes online
-   The battery status of the device is low
-   The application is upgraded
-   The user has changed to another device
-   The user specifies some interests
-   The user queries for some information to a search facility
-   The application starts
-   The application stops
-   The user chats with another user
-   The application sends data to another application
-   The cookie(s) in the web application are changing

### Webinos metrics workers

Metrics can be conducted either locally on the user device or remotely on web servers. In both cases there are metrics worker threads/ processes that perform the metrics separately in the background. This enables both heavy- and light-weight metrics tasks to be executed without affecting the user interface behaviour or any other communication activities such as web requests and responses. The overall idea is to conduct webinos metrics as a background task preferably on the user device, and alternatively on the web server side. In webinos, we therefore propose two metrics types of metrics workers:

-   **Application metrics workers** - integrated with the local application on the device
-   **Server metrics workers** - integrated at the front-tier of remote web servers

A web site can be standalone of distributed across several web servers. In the latter case, information from the metrics events occurring in the client application will be needed to glue together web logs on the server side. It is difficult to uniquely identify application sessions on the website side. Logging the webinos metrics event on the client side is therefore the recommended route, however, sometimes this will lead to too much metrics and the marketing manager might instead want you to monitor what is going on the web server side and not bother too much about what happens on the client application.

An e-commerce web site might consist of a product offering server, an advertisement server, and a separate payment service provider. In this case it will be difficult to know what is going on in the application session, because the dynamically generated web pages from the domain name result in a response that is build from subsequent requests to the other web servers in the background.

Webinos server side deals with this problem by offering webinos metrics workers for the web server. These components are geared towards web sites that consist of several web servers, and when there is a need for metrics on the sever-side to be able to act in the metrics data in the situation between a web request and its response from the web site.

### Application metrics logs and server metrics logs

Webinos metrics workers collects and adds metrics data and add them to the metrics logs. A webinos metrics log is either stored locally on a device or remotely on for instance a web server. Metrics logs located on the user device are called application metrics logs, and server metrics logs created by a worker thread/ process on a remote web server, are referred to as server metrics logs. Both types of metrics logs are created by the webinos metrics workers which are either running locally on the user device, or remotely hooked up and integrated in the front-tier of the web site/ web farm.

Formal Specification
--------------------

### Reference architecture for application metrics workers

The following diagram shows the reference architecture for when an application developer chooses to implement Use Case I above. The advantage of following this approach is that one can very accurately monitor and capture the application session for each individual application on the device. It ensures a high quality of the gathered metrics data, because the application on the user device is in full control over the interaction states that the user is going through. The general principle is that each application can monitor the local metrics data and events as and when these happen on the device. Moving the webinos metrics intelligence towards the application client can also significantly reduce the computational resources needed for the webinos analytics service to effectively aggregate analytics data from the metrics data of the individual application sessions.

The application registers its intent to use the application metrics library. It also does the same for the context API. If the webinos runtime allows this, the application will be writing metrics data to the local application metrics log when it encounters the metrics points in the application. The application developer is able to consume the context information provided by any context provider on the device - provided that the policy manager permits. Such context information originating from other context providers in the system is captured and added to the application metrics log. Examples of such context information is location, nearby devices, wireless networks, and so on. Furthermore, context information about the application, such as when it started, paused, resumed, stopped, and ended can be logged. Finally, metrics data about web requests can be added to the log by the application metrics worker - again only if the policy manager permits. Thus, any context information sourced by a context provider on the end-user device, including also context information about web requests and responses, can instantly be logged by the application metrics workers.

"Webinos analytics" -> "Application metrics log" [label="Aggregates data from"]
}

</div>
The webinos analytics receives the application metrics log from a background task that is running on the user device. The application session is easy to maintain locally, because there is only one session. The application maintains its own state, and the application developer can choose to gather and add whatever context information believed to be needed for the analytics. Capturing context information about web requests is also straight forward. The application developer makes use of the context API to capture and manage the web context attributes whenever the application is requesting for information from remote web servers. The aggregation of analytics from the logged metrics data, becomes an easy task, because all of the captured metrics data is uniquely related to the application sessions at hand, and well defined context providers on the user device - such as for example various sensors.

Note that webinos-enabled applications using the webinos metrics library need to flag the intent to use the API. This means that it is possible for the webinos runtime, and the individual users, to switch off all or some of the gathered metrics data at any time. We believe that this will create more trust and transparency for the users compared to the existing approach of for instance Google analytics, which is: "don’t tell the user about what is being metered, and don’t let them switch it off either".

Thus, both from the local metrics and privacy point of views, webinos analytics certainly makes progress in favour of users compared to existing analytics solutions for the web. Moreover, from the application developer’s point of view, it is possible to gather richer metrics data, because the application metrics worker is working locally within the context of each application session.

### Reference architecture for server metrics workers

This next diagram exhibits the reference architecture for when an application developer chooses to implement Use Case II above. The advantage of this approach is that the metering capability is added to the front-end of the web site. This is a less intrusive approach, because the metrics worker is integrated on the web server instead of within the client application. This approach is also capable of capturing metrics data about individual application sessions. The difficulty, however, is in being able to keep track of the application session and state when interacting with the web site. In general, this is regarded as more difficult to do this on the web server side, because the amount of context information that can be captured other than those directly related to the web requests and responses is reduced due to the stateless nature of the HTTP protocol, and also because there can be many sessions from different applications instances to serve at the same time. However, it ensures that the client application code does not have to be altered to achieve the metrics data, because the server metrics worker is responsible for capturing states that the user is going through. The general principle is that each web site gathers the metrics data of individual application sessions as and when these events happen. Moving the metrics intelligence towards the server side however does increase the computational resources needed for the webinos analytics service to aggregate quality data the from the metrics. The metrics points would not always correlate with the points of web requests, and similarly it sometimes would also be artificial to send web requests to a web server just because a metrics point in the client application was reached. Such situations create overhead for the webinos analytics in terms of aggregating analytics data.

"Server metrics worker" -> "Web site" [label="Works at the front end of"]

"Webinos analytics" -> "Server metrics log" [label="Aggregates data from"]
}

</div>
The server metrics workers use the context information available on the web server in conjunction with web requests and responses to capture and elicit metrics data. A web request starts inside the client application on the device when the user clicks a web link, or formulates the request via some other means. The request lasts until the local application has retrieved, parsed, and rendered the response to the user. During the response period, the web site performs a variety of subsequent activities often starting with sending cookies to the local application at first, before proceeding to respond with subsequent content that in return can lead to subsequent requests for other content such as more html text, scripts, multimedia, and images. In a webinos-enabled application that works by performing many web requests and responses during the application session, it can be natural to conduct metrics on the contextual information pertaining to web requests and responses.

Web servers in general have a set of environment variables that together define the context of the web server for each connection, including web requests and responses. Some of these variables are web server specific, whereas the majority of them are web request specific. One can obtain a list of these variables on the web server. Server metrics workers have access to these environment variables and uses a cookie framework to keep track of individual application sessions. Although, it is in principle possible to extend the set of context information available on the web server side, we believe this approach to be more limited compared to gathering metrics data from within the actual application instance residing on the user device. For more on available environment variables (i.e. contexts information), see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Gateway_Interface#History

Note that from the end user’s point of view, this use case is less intrusive, gathers less context information, but is more difficult to control because the server metrics worker is not deployed on the user device.

### Protocol definitions

The protocols between the application, the webinos metrics workers, and webinos analytics are inspired by the emerging "W3C standard for Web Workers":http://dev.w3.org/html5/workers/ (See Editor’s Draft 7 July 2011). Web workers enable web applications to launch scripts that runs in the background while the user interacts with the user interface. In this way, time consuming tasks can be executed without interrupting any ongoing user interface, storage, or communication activities. With such background scripts in mind, the W3C standard for web workers was proposed as a JavaScript API, where it is up to the application developer to implement what the web worker actually does.

The difference between the metrics workers in webinos and the W3C standard for web workers, is that our workers are specialised to perform application and web metrics. This means that our notion of a metrics worker is more specific than the web worker definition. Thus, we have made some more choices on what the webinos metrics workers do. This is also why the webinos metrics can only seek inspration from the W3C web worker standard. If webinos fully adopted the web worker standard as is, it would simply make the application code grow unecessarily large for the application developer.

### JavaScript APIs

This specification defines an JavaScript API for application metrics that allows application developers to start a background application metrics worker that run in parallel to their application. The desired metrics data can be gathered throughout the application session at both predefined and custom metrics points. The metrics data is passed on as messages to the metrics worker in a thread-like, asynchronous fashion. The metrics worker can upload the metrics to the analytics service in the background.

This library enables the application developer to run metrics scripts in the background independently of the main application. This means the application metrics worker will not be interrupted by the user’s interaction with the application, and therefore can be performed without worries about how long it may take to gather and upload the metrics for analytics.

Each application is provided with only one instance of the application metrics worker each, so that the runtime is not overloaded with metrics workers. In principle, it is anticipated that the application developer will register its intent to use the metrics worker at the beginning of the application session, soon after the application has been launched, and the metrics worker thread will normally continue until the application ends - unless the application developer wants to end it earlier.

#### The MetricsProvider interface

<pre><code class="javascript">
interface MetricsProvider {
/* The metrics provider interface must be implemented by
any application that would like to use webinos analytics.
**/

void onRegisterMetrics(Session session, MetricsPermissions permissions);
/** The method is called back by the metrics worker
if the registration has been successful by the application.
An application session object is provided as parameter for the
application to refer to when providing metrics. Also a list of
the permitted data and events is communicated to
the metrics provider.
**/

void onUnregisterMetrics(Session session);
/** The application metrics worker calls back this method
when the application has been successful in calling
the unregister method of the application metrics worker.
The application session object is provided as input parameter.
**/

void onStopUpload(Session session);
/** The application metrics worker calls back this method after
the application has called the stopUpload() method of the
application metrics worker to initiate the stop.
**/

void onStartUpload(Session session);
/** The application metrics worker will call back this method
when the application called the startUpload() method of
the application metrics worker to start the upload of
the metrics data to the analytics service.
**/

void onMetricsLogged(Session session, Event event);

/*This method is called by the metrics worker whenever
 metrics data has been added to the application metrics log.
(Rename to onMetricsEvent?)
**/

void onMetricsUploaded(Session session, Event event);
/*
This method is called by the metrics worker whenever
a batch of metrics data has been uploaded to the analytics service.
**/



};
</code></pre>

h4. The MetricsWorker interface

<pre><code class="javascript">
interface MetricsWorker {

void register(Intent intent, MetricsProvider provider, Key key);
/** The application must to register its intent to use the
application metrics worker. It needs to use the key provided to
the application developer when registering online as
a user of analytics. It also must refer to the provider itself.
A metrics permissions object is returned that contains a list of
metrics permissions.
**/

void unregister(MetricsProvider provider, Session session);
/** The application can unregister itself from application metrics.
This will stop the metrics worker and close any web connection that
maybe busy uploading metric data to the online analytics.
The call will result in a call back to the onUnregisterMetrics method
with the session object. The input parameters must be correct for
the un-registration to succeed.
**/

void startSession(MetricsDataEvent);
/** This method indicates when the application session is started.
It should normally be called by the application just after
the application has been created/ initialised.
?Returns that the application session started via a call back method?
**/

void pauseSession(MetricsDataEvent);
/** This method tells the metrics worker that the application session
has temporarily paused. The normal place to call this method,
would be when the user or the runtime is pausing the application
in some way or another. This would typically be in conjunction with
the onPause method of the application.
?A call to the method will result in a call back from
the metrics worker to the … method of the application with parameters
indicating that the session has been paused.?
**/

void resumeSession(MetricsDataEvent);
/** This method tells the metrics worker that the application session
has been resumed/ become active again after it was paused.
The usual place to for the application to call this method,
is in conjunction with the onResume method of the application.
?Returns that the application session resumed. A call to this method
will result in a call back from the metrics worker to the … method
of the application with parameters indicating that the session
has been resumed.?
**/

void closeSession(MetricsDataEvent);
/** Calling this method will log that the session has been closed.
It will log this and stop any eventual upload activity to the
analytics service.
?This returns that the application session has been closed. ?
**/

void startUpload(Session session);
/** Calling this method will start a separate background activity
dedicated to uploading the gathered metrics data to the webinos
analytics service. The metrics data will be posted at regular intervals.
One can optionally also delete the metrics data locally,
once metrics data has been uploaded.
It will use secure web connection to webinos analytics to upload the metrics data.
?After starting the upload, a message will returned via a call back to the
… method as means to inform the application about the start of the upload.?
**/

void stopUpload();
/** A call to this method will stop any uploading activity to
the webinos analytics service. It will also close the secure
web connection to webinos analytics. ?After stopping the upload activity,
a message will returned via a call back to the … method as means
to inform the application about the uploading has been stopped.?
**/

//void onContextEvent called. Returns the Context information added.
//void post new application metrics data at regular intervals

};
</code></pre>

h4. The MetricsError interface

A metrics error describes an event that is considered to be an error compared to normal system behaviour. Please note that this interface is only intended for application developers to use when integrating with the metrics worker. These errors should not be presented to the user.

<pre><code class="javascript">
[NoInterfaceObject]
 interface MetricsError{
 const unsigned short PERMISSION_DENIED = 1;
 const unsigned short METRICS_NOT_ADDED = 2;
 const unsigned short UPLOAD_CONNECTION_LOST = 3;
 readonly attribute unsigned short code;
 readonly attribute DOMString message;
 };
</code></pre>

The code attribute must return the appropriate code from the following list:
** PERMISSION_DENIED - The authentication process failed because the application does not have the permission to gather the metrics data that it intends to use.
* METRICS_NOT_ADDED - The metrics data that was supposed to be added to the log, was not added to the log for some reason. For instance, a provider of context information does not work, the log is not possible to write to, and so on.
* UPLOAD_CONNECTION_LOST - The secure connection to the analytics service was unexpectedly lost. For instance, if the device is out of range from the wireless network etc.

The message attribute must contain an error message that describes the details error details. Please note that this attribute is primarily intended for application debugging. Application developers should not use for instance to present it to the user.

#### A metrics worker needs the following interface to be included in the foundations

An application affords tasks and information to the end user. Tasks are focussed activities that the end user can perform to accomplish their goals, desires, and interests related to the information. An application enables a finite set of user tasks, and some applications can also to some extent perform automatic tasks on behalf of the user. An application provides a user interface for the application developer to render user interface components, text, video, graphics, sound, vibration and so on. Thus, it provides a canvas/view where the application developer can present the user interface components and the information to the user. Applications would normally be presented in full screen mode on most mobile devices; however, applications can also be presented in other ways depending on the look and feel of the device.

Applications must be started by the runtime via the startApplication method. This might have been triggered by the end user for instance clicking the application icon to launch the application. The ApplicationLifecycle interface reflects the various states that the application can undergo during its lifecycle - from whenever after it has been installed/ made available for the runtime to launch.

Webinos metrics workers assume a tight integration with the application lifecycle states and method calls, because an application session endures throughout the application lifecycle. An application session should normally start when the application is launched, and normally should be closed when the application is being shut down.

<pre><code class="javascript">

interface ApplicationLifecycle{
/* The ApplicationLifecycle interface must be implemented by all applications.
If the application developer see no need in implementing and using
some of the methods, the application developer can leave the methods
unimplemented.
**/

void onCreate();
/** onCreate is called by the runtime when the application is starting.
The application should initialise its starting state when
implementing this method. A user interface is instantiated and
provided in conjunction with this call.
**/

void onStart();
/*Called by the runtime when the application is (re)started.
The application should call the startSession method of the
application metrics worker when this method is called,
as means to log when the application session (re)started.
Thus, this is either called after the onCreate() or onRestart()
methods have been called. The application user interface will be
redrawn again in conjunction with this method call.
**/

void onResume();
/* Called when the application is resumed/ put in the foreground.
The application should call the resumeSession() method of the
metrics worker when this method is called,
as means to log when the application session resumes.
**/

void onPause();
/** Called when the application is paused/ put in the background.
The application should call the pauseSession() method of the
metrics worker when this method is called,
as means to log when the application session pauses.
**/

void onStop();
/** Called after onPause when the application is no longer
visible for the end user. One of three things can happen
after this method call: The application can either
be restarted, destroyed, or just do nothing of the device
for example is switched off by the end user. Thus, what
happens next depends completely on the interaction with
the end user. The methods onRestart() or onDestroy()
can be called, but this is not guaranteed unless that was the
intention of the end user.
**/

void onRestart();
/** Called after the onStop method if the user interacts
in a way on the device that indicated that the user
wants the application to restart again. It is called when the
application is presented/ made visible to the end user again.
A call to this method also implies that both the onStart and onResume
methods will be subsequently called afterwards as a result.
**/

void onDestroy();
/** The application will use this method to shut down the
application metrics worker before the application exits.
The application should call the closeSession method of the
application metrics worker when this method is called,
as means to log when the application session is closed.
The metrics worker will try to upload the metrics in the background,
after the application has been destroyed.
**/

};
</code></pre>

Please note that the webinos application lifecycle interface is heavily inspired by the activity lifecycle in Android. See the Android "Activity":http://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/Activity.html class. This is a tested foundation that works very well. The activity lifecycle of Android is inspired by other state of the art mobile platforms too, such as J2ME, Symbian, and iOS.


h3. Dependencies on other components

Application metrics workers are dependent on the following:
** Context API
* Secure storage
* Secure Socket Layer communication

Server metrics workers are dependent on the following:
* The web server platform of choice
* The Common Gateway Interface of the web server
* Secure storage
