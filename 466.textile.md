Overlay networking APIs
=======================

-   [[Overlay networking]]

The overlay networking model shields users and web developers from lower level details for each interconnect technology. Lower level APIs are exposed by browser extensions and made use of by 3rd party libraries written in JavaScript. These libraries in turn expose higher level APIs for discovery, browsing the context and sending messages between devices. We need to prototype the overlay network model, but the emphasis will be on the usability of the high level APIs. The low level APIs will need to be standardized, but that can be done in a later phase.

Description
-----------

This section defines low level APIs for access to interconnect technologies including discovery and messaging mechanisms.
