Abstract (draft - up for discussion)
------------------------------------

The following chapter specifies how the Personal Zone Proxy (PZP) enables the local, client-side adaptation of the user interface (UI) of a webinos application based on the device characteristics. The adaptation process takes several of these characteristics into consideration, the most notable being screen size and resolution, device type and input modalities.

To make this possible, applications will be created with a declarative user interface description that is device-independent. This description will stay as close to the basic web technologies as possible. At this time, two approaches are viable: HTML annotations or JS declarations. At runtime, this description is transformed into a HTML/CSS/JS layout suited for a web runtime.

This chapter will also explore the possibility to share parts of the user interface across devices. Using the basic JS mechanism to fetch DOM elements for a local page, an application can get parts of a remote applicationâ€™s user interface to incorporate into its own interface. This allows lightweight provision of UI elements to a remote device without the need to install a full widget or child widget there. From an architecture point of view, the intrusion is lightweight - the necessary mechanism for PZP to PZP communication already exists - the primary challenge is the handling of security on the secondary devices to avoid impersonation of a local UI by a remote application.
