Background information on further development of webinos phase 1 APIs
=====================================================================

This section describes the updates made in phase 2 to the API specifications from phase 1 and the rationale behind these updates.

General changes due to migration to latest W3C WIDL specification.
------------------------------------------------------------------

Web IDL (â€widlâ€) defines the language webinos uses to define APIs. This is an interface definition language that can be used to describe interfaces that are intended to be implemented in web runtimes. Web IDL is an IDL variant with a number of features that allow the behavior of common script objects in the web platform to be specified more readily.

Since the webinos phase 1 APIs were specified in task 3.2 W3C has updated the "Web IDL specification":http://dev.w3.org/2006/webapi/WebIDL/. In task 3.4 the webinos API specifications were aligned with the latest W3C Web IDL specification.

The following general changes have been done to all webinos APIs:

-   â€œmoduleâ€ is no longer a valid keyword for Web IDL and all webinos phase 1 API specifications used â€moduleâ€. To adapt to that change the wrapping module Foo { } declaration in the Web IDL was removed.

-   Dictionaries should be used to define bag of properties. Interfaces had to be used before.
    See: http://dev.w3.org/2006/webapi/WebIDL/#idl-dictionaries.

-   Instead of using numerical constants, the preferred approach is to use strings; the list of valid strings can now be defined using the â€œenumâ€ keyword: enum Foo { "bar", "baz" };

-   There is now a specific mechanism to describe callback functions (using the â€œcallbackâ€ keyword) that is used instead of [NoInterfaceObject] interfaces.

-   Generally "DOMError objects":http://dvcs.w3.org/hg/domcore/raw-file/default/Overview.html#error-types-table in error callbacks are used instead of minting new errors for each API.

-   The raises / getraises / setraises keywords are no longer valid. Re-using DOMException with a specific type is now preferred. In the descriptive text it is stated which exception is thrown in certain situations. See: http://dev.w3.org/2006/webapi/WebIDL/#idl-exceptions and http://dvcs.w3.org/hg/domcore/raw-file/default/Overview.html#domexception.

Context API
-----------

In the 3.1 deliverable for context the focus was on the integration of the Context API with the rest of the proposed (then) webinos architecture, together with a set of specifications revolving around the potential usage of the API by webinos applications, while providing a few points on the actual implementation architecture. It was soon discovered during 4.1 that there was an important strategic decision to be taken. The Context API had to leave part of the data handling of the contextual information to the application developers by providing a number of tools to create, store, extract and analyse contextual information, while at the same time provide automatic mechanisms that store contextual information already transferred throughout the platform. The result was the introduction of the term and structure of "Context Object". A Context Object refers to a notion similar to a meme. It’s the minimum of data that are required to define any single personal contextual piece of information (e.g. MyLocation, MyHouse, MyFriend, MyFavoriteTVChannel etc).

The definitions of what pieces of data form a complete Context Object, where, when and how to find them are included in Context Vocabularies. These are text files in json structure. There are two forms of Context Vocabularies that were created in 4.1. The first one is the API Context Vocabulary, which is read-only to the application developer and contains definitions of Context Objects that utilise the RPC API calls that are made by applications to automatically store Context Objects. The second one is the Application Context Vocabulary, which contains the definitions of Context Objects created by applications. Application Context Objects are not stored automatically, but rather are requested to be stored by the application that defined each.

The Context Objects are flattened and stored on an SQLite3 database located on the PZH. If a connection to the PZH is not available (Virgin Mode), the data are stored in a temporary file as a buffer, until a connection to the PZH is available. The extraction of the Context Objects is performed via a custom SQL query builder created for the Context API, rather than the SPARQL specified in the previous version. This change is due to the change off scope for the query language towards a more structured database. All the events relating to Context pass through the Policy Manager.

Additionally, a Scheduled API Call has been described to run on a background Context Service, in order to allow for applications to poll on contextual information without implementing timers on an ever running application. This operation is now handled by webinos.

App2App Messaging API (previously named Event Handling API)
-----------------------------------------------------------

Rewrite based on the channel concept resulting in a smaller, more secure and more implementable API. Implements indirect inter-application communication (i.e. the applications do not directly address each other). The API supports multiple operation modes (e.g., send-receive, receive-only, p2p) and will use the webinos routing system under the hood.

AppLauncher API
---------------

Functionality of this API remains the same but asking if a certain (webinos) application is available was changed from a synchronous to an asynchronous method to be better suited for use in a distributed system like webinos where RPC calls that may take a while are involved.

Messaging API
-------------

Messaging API remains unchanged from the Version I (except for editorial fixes made earlier).

As it followed the WAC specification closely and WAC added an isSync attribute and a sync method on mail attachments, an evaluation was made on whether this should be included in webinos. The decision was made to exclude that. Partly on account of WAC messaging inheriting from a synchonizeable object, which is not present in webinos and partly because synchronization of mail attachments should be an implementation issue and not made explicit in the API.

NFC API
-------

This is a major rewrite from Version I. It reflects the charter for the proposed W3C NFC Working Group, and draws upon implementation experience for JavaScript NFC APIs at Mozilla, PhoneGap and others. The new version of the webinos NFC API includes support for the Link Logical Control Protocol for pushing NDEF messages between devices, and for bi-directional asynchronous messaging. The API further allows for discrimination between different tags for read/write operations when there are multiple tags within operational range of an NFC controller.

Payment API
-----------

While the version 1 payment API was sufficient to handle payments in an idealized world (where payment providers accept webinos authentication as secure and trustable), currently real payment providers require the use of their own authentication process and security features. To allow for this, the checkout method received an additional callback, allowing payment providers to present security queries, images and web pages to the user and receive additional confirmation to verify the payment, based on their own (and not webinos) criteria.

The Generic Sensor API
----------------------

The main changes done to this API were removing normalized values in the sensor event and addition of new sensor types.

In the phase 1 version the sensor events contained both the measured sensor value in the unit appropriate for the sensor type as well as a "normalized" value between 0 and 1. However, we have not seen any use cases for this so normalized values were dropped.

Support for humidity sensor type has been added and the rationale for this is mainly that this sensor type is now supported in Android and we want to provide it to webinos applications as well.

Support for heart rate monitor sensors has also been added. Heart rate monitors are commonly used by runners and we want to provide a simple API to developers of webinos training applications, such as the webinos heart rate monitor application.

For the future we plan to add support for external "Internet of Things"/Machine-to-Machine (M2M) sensors. This is an area that is explored by webinos. See the "webinos blog on Internet of things":http://webinos.org/blog/2012/08/13/putting-the-internet-back-in-the-internet-of-things/. To make the API more generic and extensible and facilitate support for external sensors we added a generic JSON coded configuration parameter that can be used to configure specific sensors. We also added position in the sensor event: in case a sensor has not a fixed position and a gps module onboard, it can be useful to know the position each time a values is retrieved.

Furthermore, W3C DAP WG is currently specifying a set of small sensor specific APIs and as our ambition is to align as much as possible with W3C we will consider using those APIs, when specifications are mature, for the sensors supported instead of the webinos Generic Sensor API. W3C is also standardizing Web Intents and Web Intents based APIs. We should explore and work with W3C on the possibility to use Web Intents to discover and interact with internal and external sensors/actuators.

Discovery API
-------------

The Discovery API was only slightly updated. Beside of the general changes according to WebIDL and DOMError introduction the createService method was removed from the specification. This method was used in order to bind to a pre-known service based on the service ID. This can be done too with just using findService and comparing the returned services. To not unnecessarily start discovery a serviceID field was added to the filter field so that only this one service will be returned by the discovery mechanism.

TV Control API
--------------

Two changes were made to the API. First was a bug fix which resulted in cycles between Channels and TV sources. The second on was changing the Stream attribute that represents a TV Channel to MediaStream. The MediaStream object is used by the W3C Media Capture and Streams specification so that there was a match because a TV Channel is "just" another media source.

Vehicle API
-----------

There are two major updates on the Vehicle API for the second iteration of the webinos platform. First, the API exposes additional properties available from the vehicle bus. Secondly we created a new separate API for satellite navigation related methods of the previous API. The motivation to create an additional API is that a navigation service can also be available on other devices such as a smart phone or tablet.

The new supported parameters are:
* door status (open or closed)
* window status
* enigne oil level
* seat settings

There have been minor changes to follow the W3C recommendations about API design and newly introduced features in the Web IDL specification. Where possible, constants have been replaced by enumerations and no interface objects have been replaced by dictionaries.

There might be further changes to the API in order align the specification with the efforts in Genivi fo Web API.

The webinos core interface
--------------------------

The additions in this interface are the information about the PZH name, the PZP name, connection status and application identifier. All these information are static and hold at the PZP end. The reason for exposing this information to application developer is use this information to differentiate between the PZP, the PZH and the Applications on different devices. It also includes connection status which provides information whether connected to the PZH or the peer.

Widget API
----------

The interface itself was redesigned as extension to the original W3C Widget API recommendation so that the original attributes and functions are not copied within the webinos specification but the extensions only. In addition the notification related functionality was removed from the specification, instead the W3C Web Notification API is used now for this.

Contacts API
------------

WAC and W3C APIs have been merged to create the webinos Contacts API (formerly it was based on the W3C contacts API only). The basic set of methods have been taken from WAC, to allow not only read access to contacts, but also the capability to create, add, update and delete contacts. Since W3C has a more detailed representation of the attributes of an individual contact, the definition of contact attributes have been taken from W3C.

Authentication API
------------------

isAuthenticated and getAuthenticationStatus methods are changed to asynchronous to better adapt to distributed systems.
A new callback is defined to receive isAuthenticated response.

MediaContent API (replaces W3C Gallery API)
-------------------------------------------

In phase 1 webinos adopted the W3C Gallery API. This specification has now been shelved, which means that W3C is not pursuing the approach outlined in the specification anymore. So webinos decided to search a new reference specification.

Three possible solutions have been checked:
* The Mozilla DeviceStorage API; this is a filesystem API with less functionalities than the W3C filesystem APIs adopted by webinos;
* The Tizen mediaContent API; this is similar to the W3C Gallery API previously adopted; it adds some functionality (for example the possibility to edit some metadata of the media object);
* The new W3C Gallery API; which is based on Web Intents.

The new W3C Gallery API has so far been discarded since the webinos platform does not yet support Web Intents. The decision is to adopt the Tizen solution. If and when webinos will add support for Web Intents, this will be re-investigated and eventually changed to the W3C solution.

WAC Device Status API and Vocabulary module
-------------------------------------------

The webinos phase 1 refers to WAC devicestatus module and has a webinos version of the WAC devicestatus vocabulary module that adds a number of properties needed for webinos. However, the latest version of the "WAC devicestatus module":http://specs.wacapps.net/devicestatus/index.html includes the vocabulary. For webinos phase 2 a webinos version of latest version of the WAC devicestatus module, including the added webinos properties, has been created.

For the future we should consider alignment with W3C DAP Network information API (http://dvcs.w3.org/hg/dap/raw-file/tip/network-api/Overview.html) and Battery Status API (http://dvcs.w3.org/hg/dap/raw-file/tip/battery/Overview.html) and other coming device status APIs.

WAC Device Interaction API
--------------------------

The device interaction API has been adopted directly from WAC. The primary reason for changing the API from a referred API to a webinos API is that the status of the WAC APIs seems unclear since the recent acquisition by GSMA. The intention is to keep the device application API as closely as possible aligned with the WAC API in the future, provided there are no legal or organizational reasons not to do so.

W3C Calendar API, W3C DeviceOrientation Event, W3C Geolocation API, W3C File API, W3C File API: Writer, W3C File API: Directories and System
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We continue to refer to the W3C specifications without making any modifications and follow W3C by referring to the latest versions of the W3C specifications.
