Open issues
-----------

> It SHALL be possible to address sensors and actuators that does not provide webinos support. (DA-DEV-ISMB-004)
> The webinos runtime SHOULD allow access to non-webinos APIs to device features (CAP-DWB-FHG-002)
=> Are there generic policies for non-webinos applications? need for a cloud PDP component.

> webinos SHALL provide the means to Applications to identify an event occurring in a device. (DA-DEV-NTUA-002) and others requirements under "Remote Notifications and Messaging" section
=> "Positive/Negative/… decision taken" is an Event? a change in a policy seems to be notified by an event.

> A publish-subscribe system for events SHALL exist which requires authorisation for application subscriptions. webinos SHOULD provide a policy system regarding events (PS-DEV-IBBT-004).
=> webinos should provide a policy system or a set of policies?

> A webinos Cloud shall determine the services a webinos Device is authorised to use before providing access to its services. (PS-USR-Oxford-120)
=> do we need a remote PDP or just to store these informations? in the second case: where can we store them?
=> do we need to consider the whole "Policy Manager" as an application ad apply requirements of the section "Transferring Application State Between Devices Belonging to the Same User"

### [where to store these informations?]

-   webinos shall ensure that no application can use more resources (e.g., CPU, memory, …) than declared ahead (PS-USR-TSI-3)

Not Placed Requirements
-----------------------
