Architectural Risk Analysis
===========================

Motivation
----------

The design of webinos did not start with a blank page, but with a bricolage of different model elements. By re-using existing software components, we introduced design elements into our architecture. Assumptions about possible attacks might also influence architectural decision making. Even designers with a good understanding of both the problem and solution domains may not appreciate the implications of protocol selection, or the wording of requirements. Moreover, because the abstractions used by a designer don’t always match those used by an attacker then flaws missed by the former may be found and exploited by the latter. Consequently, we need tools that help us assess the security consequences of bringing together different model elements.

The aim of an architectural risk analysis is to identify design-level flaws in a software architecture. This process was first described by McGraw ([[D036_References#McGraw2006|McGraw2006]]), and motivated by the claim that design flaws account for a significant number of security problems; such flaws cannot be identified by code-inspection alone. An architectural risk analysis shares many of the characteristics of classic risk analysis: it emphasises tangible assets of business value and, as a process, is knowledge intensive, requiring knowledge of both the problem domain and security expertise about potential flaws and attacks. In other respects, however, architectural risk analysis is more challenging. It relies on additional knowledge about solution-based models that form the basis of a software architecture, along with a sense of the requirements and constraints implicitly assumed when these are adopted.

In D2.7 and D2.8, we illustrated how the IRIS meta-model can deal with risks in the broader socio-technical environment within which a software system is situated. The IRIS (Integrating Requirements and Information Security) meta-model was developed at the University of Oxford to integrate concepts from Usability, Security, and Requirements Engineering ([[D036_References#Faily2010b|Faily2010b]]); this laid the foundations for subsequent work that evaluated the security and usability implications of mitigating risks ([[D036_References#Faily2010b|Faily2010b]]), and representations for archetypical attackers behind these risks ([[D036_References#Atzeni2011|Atzeni2011]]). This work has also contributed to the development of the open-source Computer Aided Integration of Requirements and Information Security (CAIRIS) requirements management tool ([[D036_References#CAIRIS|CAIRIS]]), which has been validated using real-world case studies, e.g. ([[D036_References#Faily2010c|Faily2010c]], [[D036_References#Faily2011a|Faily2011a]]).

Two further augmentations are needed for undertaking a more detailed analysis of software architectures. First, although the IRIS meta-model provides substantial support for modelling the problem domain, solution domain concepts are limited to the notion of assets. While modelling assets is necessary for architectural risk analysis, it is not sufficient as many features of an architecture warrant analysis in their own right; these include the architecture’s _attack surface_ — the measure of its exposure to attack — and the properties of connections between its elements. Second, model representations are needed for specifying the elements of software architecture and the attacks these need to resist. These representations need to match the thinking that designers might have about different perspectives of a system, and it should be possible for them to quickly evaluate the consequences that attack and defence elements might have on each other.

Approach
--------

The approach prescribed by McGraw for carrying out an architectural risk analysis involves carrying out three steps. In the first step, an _attack resistance analysis_ is carried out to identify general flaws from the literature and knowledge bases of known attacks and, based on these, identifying potential risks and their viability. In the second step an _ambiguity analysis_ is carried out to discover new risks resulting from ambiguity and inconsistency in a design. In the final step, a _weakness analysis_ identifies weaknesses that might arise due to the impact of the architecture’s dependencies. Interested readers may wish to refer to ([[D036_References#McGraw2006|McGraw2006]]) for a more detailed presentation of this process, although Khan et al. ([[D036_References#Khan2011|Khan2011]]) provide a more recent illustrative example based on an analysis of the Chromium browser.

To support a _model-driven_ architectural risk analysis, we build two model-based constructs: architectural patterns and contextualised attack patterns. The following sections describe how these constructs are defined and used.

### Architectural patterns

Architectural patterns were proposed by Buschmann et al. ([[D036_References#Buschmann1996|Buschmann1996]]) to express a model of a software system, provide a set of pre-defined sub-systems, specify responsibilities, and include rules and guidelines for organising the relationships between model elements. To capture the elements of an architectural design pattern, we introduce new concepts to the IRIS meta-model, while making use of existing concepts and relationships. Collectively, the architectural patterns meta-model in Figure 1 provides three different views of an architectural pattern.

_Figure 1: Architectural Pattern Meta-Model_

The first of these is a component and connector view, which is expressed using UML component diagrams. This captures the runtime attributes of a system in terms of its computational elements (components) and the interaction pathways between them. Components are attached to connectors via interfaces; these are services or methods through which component interaction takes place. Interfaces are associated with an access right to indicate the level of authorisation needed to use the interface. Interfaces also have a particular privilege level. Connectors, like components, are characterised by their access rights and also by the protocol upon which the connector runs. These meta-model components are closely aligned with the model of software architecture described by Gennari & Garlan, which was recently adapted to capture the elements of a software architecture’s attack surface ([[D036_References#Gennari2012|Gennari2012]]). This involves specifying the model elements associated with components and connectors, and assigning numeric privilege, access right, and protocol values to these elements. These values range between 0 and 10 and represent an element’s exposure to attack; the higher the value, the greater the exposure. These values make it possible to formally evaluate the damage potential associated with interfaces, data transmitted through a connector, and untrusted data items with respect to restrictions placed on the data they contain. This model is described in more detail in the ambiguity analysis section.

The second is a goal view, and is characterised by the system requirements that motivate or constrain the architectural components; within the IRIS meta-model, these system requirements are expressed using KAOS (Knowledge Acquisition in automated Specification) goals and goal models. ([[D036_References#VanLamsweerde2009|VanLamsweerde2009]]). KAOS responsibility links describe the roles responsible for satisfying the behaviour associated with requirements, while concern links are used to describe instances where requirements reference or constrain assets.

The third view is based on a module view of assets. These assets are salient concepts of value that are specific to components or connectors; this view is expressed using UML class diagrams.

### Contextualised attack patterns

Attack patterns are descriptions of common methods for exploiting software that both provide an attacker’s perspective, together with guidance towards mitigating them ([[D036_References#CAPEC|CAPEC]]). In recent years, work on attack patterns has been popularised by the development of open-source intelligence Common Attack Pattern Enumeration and Classification (CAPEC) ([[D036_References#CAPEC|CAPEC]]) and Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) ([[D036_References#CWE|CWE]]) repositories. Although these repositories offer a wealth of useful attack data, the patterns are deliberately abstract in order that they can be applicable in as many contexts as possible. To provide this context and re-use as much existing model data as possible when applying these patterns, we have developed a meta-model for _contextualised attack patterns_. These model both the attack and design elements necessary to instantiate an attack within a specific context of use.

The model upon which contextualised attack patterns are based is the _Gang of Four_ design pattern template ([[D036_References#Gamma1995|Gamma1995]]). However, the meta-model is based exclusively on existing concepts and associations in the IRIS meta-model. As such, when a contextualised attack pattern is introduced into CAIRIS, it introduces a new risk, together with the IRIS model elements that act as its rationale. The relationship between the contextualised attack pattern structure and the meta-model is illustrated in Figure 2 by the UML comment nodes denoting the name of the pattern elements.

The intent and consequences elements are used to describe the overall intent of the attack, and the external impact of the attack being successful. This impact is broader than the impact of a particular architectural pattern and is described using terminology that all system stakeholders can understand. The applicability element states the environment within which the attack pattern will be introduced. This is also the same environment within which architectural patterns will be situated to determine whether the design elements are resistant to this or other attack patterns within the environment.

The structure element describes the details of the attack itself. Attacks and Exploits are drawn from both CAPEC and CWE. The structure is closely complemented by the participant element, which models information about the attack; this includes the attacker’s capabilities and motives for carrying out the attack. This information is derived from personas that have been created for possible attackers. Personas are specifications of archetypical user behaviour that are grounded in empirical data collected from representative users ([[D036_References#Pruitt2006|Pruitt2006]]). These add a substantial amount of context to the analysis because not only do these add a human face to the attackers behind attack patterns, these are grounded in data sources about real attackers.

To describe how the attack defined by the structure might be implemented, leaf obstacles are associated with threats and vulnerabilities and a KAOS obstacle model is defined to describe how these might arise. Like the KAOS goal model in the architectural pattern, these obstacles might concern assets, and responsibility associations describe the roles responsible for satisfying obstacles.

As van Lamsweerde et al. have observed ([[D036_References#VanLamsweerde1998|VanLamsweerde1998]]), a KAOS obstacle model can be seen as a goal-driven form of a fault tree. However, unlike fault trees, our approach to obstacle modelling is closely tied to other artifacts such as previous knowledge about attacks and information about the attackers that might carry these out. Collectively, where useful statistical data about possible attacks exists, this information can help us predict the likelihood of particular obstacles being satisfied. When a probability value is specified for this likelihood then a rationale statement also needs to be provided to justify it. This is necessary because, when attack patterns are imported into a CAIRIS model, it may not be immediately obvious that the obstacle or the obstacle model arose from them. By proving this justification, we have some way of understanding the thinking that motivated this value. Based on these values, we can evaluate the probability of a particular cut of an obstacle tree based on the same equations used to evaluate the faults in a fault tree. For example, for an obstacle O_x with leaf goals O_1 and O_2, the probability of O_x (i.e. P (O_x)) where O_1 and O_2 are AND-refinements is O_1 x O_2; where O_1 and O_2 are OR-refinements then P (O_x) is O_1 + O_2.

Like classic design patterns, the collaboration concept describes the classes necessary to achieve the designer’s intent. However, in the case of attack patterns, the classes are assets and the designers are attackers. As such, the collaborating assets are those which are targeted by threats or exploited by vulnerabilities. Closely aligned with this concept are motivating security properties of interest to an attacker realising this pattern.

### Architectural Risk Analysis Process

For D3.6, we have applied an architectural risk analysis process which is based on that proposed by McGraw. These are described in more detail in the following steps.

#### Attack resistance analysis

In this step, we begin to populate the contextualised attack pattern template based on potential security concerns that may be associated with the pattern. This includes searching the imported knowledge bases for the pattern structure elements, and identifying attacker personas with the ability to carry out the identified attack. If the existing attacker personas do not have either the capabilities or motives for carrying out the attack, then it may be necessary to create a new, more meaningful attacker persona. The process for doing this is beyond the scope of this paper, but is described in more detail by ([[D036_References#Atzeni2011|Atzeni2011]]).

To illustrate how each attack pattern comes about, KAOS obstacle models are developed to illustrate the conditions that make the attack possible. Where appropriate, attack and exploit elements are associated with root or leaf obstacles in the obstacle model. As further obstacles are elicited, these are refined to identify other potential threats and vulnerabilities. As this model evolves then, where possible, probability values are assigned to obstacles, and potential goal and responsibility links are assigned to known system assets and roles referenced in the contextualised attack pattern.

Once the attack patterns were finalised, the leaf obstacles in each attack pattern obstacle model were noted for subsequent ambiguity analysis. These would either need to be satisfied by the software architecture, or their non-satisfaction would need to be motivated.

#### Ambiguity analysis

For a specific areas of architectural significance, architectural patterns are created to encompass the component and connector, requirement, and asset views associated with this area. As McGraw suggests ([[D036_References#McGraw2006|McGraw2006]]), this is the most intellectually demanding part of the process because the information necessary to populate the pattern needs to be elicited from various sources, including design documentation and source code. It is also necessary to involve other designers and domain experts to validate the architectural pattern as it is specified. For this reason, the pattern itself will invariably be revised throughout the architectural risk analysis process.

Once the architectural patterns have been finalised, the _Damage Effort Ratios_ (DER) were calculated for each architectural pattern. The DERs are a ratio of the potential damage done by exploiting resources over the amount of effort an attacker expends to access it ([[D036_References#Gennari2012|Gennari2012]]). Building on previous work by Gennari and Garlan [ibid], it is possible to evaluate the damage potential across the interfaces (DER_m), channels (DER_c), and untrusted surfaces (DER_i) are calculated. These formulae for these ratios are defined below:

-   DER_m: Privilege / Access right
-   DER_c: Protocol / Access right
-   DER_i: Surface type / Access right

These ratios not only provide a high-level quantative measure of the webinos attack surface, their automatic evaluation also provides a quick spot check for unexpected results that might suggest an incomplete analysis, or hitherto unaddressed areas of the architectural risk analysis. If there are unusual or unexpected values, the source architectural patterns can be reviewed and, where appropriate, revised before proceeding.

The next step in this analysis involves taking the leaf obstacles from the attack resistance analysis, and eliciting one or more requirements that mitigate them. Each mitigating requirement is categorised with the affected architectural pattern component/s, an indication of whether it is satisfied or not, and the rationale for how the mitigating requirement is treated. Where mitigating requirements are satisfied, the requirements are added to the architectural patterns and incorporated into the KAOS goal model associated with each component. A KAOS _resolution_ link is also added to the attack pattern obstacle model to indicate that the leaf obstacle has been mitigated. Where mitigating requirements are not satisfied, a KAOS domain property object is created to capture the rationale for not addressing the requirement. These domain properties represent hypothesis or assertions about the environment that assume as part of our analysis, e.g. that a particular requirement is out of scope. Like mitigating requirements, the KAOS obstacle model associated with the respective attack pattern is updated to reflect that the obstacle is resolved [albeit imperfectly] by the domain property.

#### Weakness analysis

The final step in the architectural risk analysis considers whether any residual weaknesses remain in each architectural pattern. This analysis involves considering assets that are associated with both architectural and contextualised attack pattern, and — for threats or vulnerabilities associated these assets — whether the software architecture adequately addresses them. For each architectural pattern, the measures in place to address the affected threats or vulnerabilities are described.

#### Tool-support

To support it, we modified CAIRIS to support the aforementioned changes to the IRIS meta-model. We have also modelled architectural patterns and contextualised attack patterns as XML Data Type Descriptions; these facilitate the import of both types of artifact directly into CAIRIS. Because these patterns make use of existing models from previous work from other deliverables, D2.4, D2.5, D2.7, and D2.8) as well as open-source intelligence from CAPEC, CWE and OWASP, we have stored these pattern files in the webinos WP 2 git repository, and have updated the specification build scripts (developed for D2.5) to import both the patterns and directories of potential threats and vulnerabilities into CAIRIS. More information about CAIRIS’s facilities for importing threat and vulnerability directories can be found in ([[D036_References#Faily2011b|Faily2011b]]).
