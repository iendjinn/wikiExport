WP32 Status update session notes
================================

See "Webinos-WP3_2-APIs Status update presentation Sophia Antipolis June 7":http://dev.webinos.org/redmine/attachments/644/Webinos-WP3_2-APIs_Status_update_Sophia_Antipolis_June_7.pptx

Event handling APIs.
--------------------

Stefano plans to submit API proposal prior to deadline.

Dom asked why we need this low level API. Is it for developers? Use cases need to be clarified.

Daniel proposed multicast.

Issue - Webinos wrappers for references API specifications from W3C and WAC
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Daniel offered to create Webinos wrappers for referred W3C and WAC specifications "Task 371":http://dev.webinos.org/redmine/issues/371 created

Issue - "Feature" URI string
------------------------------

**Action for all API editors to define "feature" strings, used e.g. to identify API features in findServices(), in section 4 of each API specification.** Se example "Sensors feature URIs":http://dev.webinos.org/specifications/draft/sensors.html#api-features

Nick: Should developers always use service discovery to access Webinos APIs, even for local resources.

Anders: No, we can’t override existing implementations of for example the W3C Geolocation API. However, all Webinos APIs should be discoverable through ServiceDiscovery.

Issue - Extended IDL attributes
-------------------------------

Dom: No need to make this 100% consistent within Webinos. Implementations will work anyway. However, when we take API specifications to standardization this has to be correct.

Claes proposes that we as starting point follow the W3C DAP way, which means:

-   All interfaces define [NoInterfaceObject]
-   Callback interfaces also define [Callback=FunctionOnly]

**Action for all API editors to update their APIs according to above**

Issue - APIs start page
-----------------------

Dom has updated webinos.sh to generate "APIs start page":http://dev.webinos.org/specifications/draft/

The summary text is fetched from the first paragraph in the section 1 Introduction of the API specification.

**Action for all API editors to check the first paragraph in the section 1 Introduction of the API specification and update it if it doesn’t look good in the summary at the API start page**

Issue â€“ event based APIs consistency
--------------------------------------

**Action for all API editors to add â€initEvent methodâ€ for DOM events (if used) if not there already. Proposed wording: see "Sensor event":http://dev.webinos.org/specifications/draft/sensors.html#::sensors::SensorEvent**

Statement on "addEventListener" under investigation. Will come back on this.

Issue â€“ Date and version and copyright in API heading
--------------------------------------------------------

**Action "374":http://dev.webinos.org/redmine/issues/374 on Stephan to state the wording on copyright and Daniel to include the statements in the idl toolchain.**
