widlproc executable for Windows.
--------------------------------

No update from Paddy. The new version of Visual Studio causes problem for upgrading the widplproc executable. So currently windows users cant’t "test generate" html specifications on their local machine. For those users modified widls have to be committed/pushed to the Redmine API repository without previous local validation. This is not convenient and might mean several commits/pushes. For each push error messages have to be read, widl be corrected and a new commit/push has to be done. This is not ideal but we need to start updating our API specifications so windows users have to live with this until the widlproc is fixed.

Wrappers for referred APIs
--------------------------

Development tool chain needs widl wrappers and we need to create full widl wrappers for the referred APIs for which we donâ€™t have that already. Dom to provide tool and do the extraction work according to http://dev.webinos.org/redmine/issues/900. All wrappers to use the latest version of original specification.

Better background information and traceability for new webinos APIs
-------------------------------------------------------------------

http://dev.webinos.org/redmine/projects/t3-4/wiki/New_proposed_Webinos_APIs

We need to provide better background information and traceability for new webinos APIs. This was a comment from the latest EU review. A process for providing Scenarios and Use Cases as background information to new APIs is proposed. See mail https://listen.fokus.fraunhofer.de/sympa/arc/webinos-wp3-ml/2012-06/msg00021.html. Paolo stated that this process does not suit all APIs, e.g. the oAuth API, and Christian meant that the need for some APIs are obvious. Claes stated that most important is that we provide some traceable background information/motivation for new APIs that we specify and implement and suggests that this process is followed when appropriate. Other means to provide background information is also ok if this suits better.

webinos core management api - Habib
-----------------------------------

Habib requests an API for things like:

-   Path towards webinos storage
-   Webinos PZP id
-   Webinos PZH id
-   Webinos connected PZP’s online and offline status
-   Webinos connected PZH’s online and offline status
-   Error status - (communication failure, connecting to pzh failure, authentication failure)
-   Retrieving Application ID.
-   Webinos logging mechanism
-   Webinos service capability broadcast
-   PZH & PZP configuration parameters
-   Remote management provisioning
-   Personal device management
-   QoS based discovery

Some of this is implemented in task 4.1 but it is not well specified and could be considered as a Q&D solution. So we need to work on this a provide a well specified API.

API specification alignment with task 4.1 API implementations and prestudy on further work
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

http://dev.webinos.org/redmine/projects/t3-4/wiki/API_specification_alignment_with_task_41_API_implementations

-   Context API: Christos has updated the wiki with implementation notes and suggestions for improvements for this API. "Action Christos to initiate an e-mail review of improvements proposed and if no objections update specification accordingly.":http://dev.webinos.org/redmine/issues/880

-   Events API: Andre proposes simplifications to the API. Does not seem controversial. "Action Andre to update specification according to simplifications proposed":http://dev.webinos.org/redmine/issues/881

-   Messaging API: Webinos Messaging API is based on WAC Messaging API. WAC has now added ‘isInSync’ attribute and ‘sync()’ method to MsgAttachment interface. We should add this our API as well. If no objections on mailing list "Action Christian to add ‘isInSync’ attribute and ‘sync()’ method":http://dev.webinos.org/redmine/issues/904

-   NFC API: There is a lot of activity on NFC in W3C, B2G, Tizen etc. Action Claes to ask Hans, Stefano and Dave on their view on webinos NFC API taking activities around NFC in W3C, B2G, etc into consideration.

-   Payment API: The Payment API is currently limited. It works for SIM/Mobile subscription payment methods but not for general credit card payment. However, for now Christian proposes to leave this API as is.

-   Sensors API: "Action Claes to update API according to proposal at wiki":http://dev.webinos.org/redmine/issues/885. In addition Ziran has "Action to add proposed additional sensor types to Sensor API":http://dev.webinos.org/redmine/projects/t3-4/wiki/New_proposed_Webinos_APIs#Sensor-API-proposed-additional-sensor-types. This is based on MWC pulse meter demo.

-   Service Discovery API: Alexander has updated wiki and proposes to remove createService. "Action Anders to discuss createService and long-lived relations with Service":http://dev.webinos.org/redmine/issues/905.

-   Service Disovery versus Device Discovery API: Ziran has provided input on implementation of discovery in task 4.1. See https://listen.fokus.fraunhofer.de/sympa/arc/webinos-wp3-ml/2012-05/msg00074.html. "Action Ziran to investigate need for Device Discovery API":http://dev.webinos.org/redmine/issues/906

-   TV API: "Action Martin to update TV API":http://dev.webinos.org/redmine/issues/907

-   Vehicle API: "Action Simon to update Vehicle API":http://dev.webinos.org/redmine/issues/908
