Session Security
----------------

### Introduction

This section is about how to protect sessions. There are several types of sessions in webinos, including:

# normal web sessions: HTTP out of the box is a stateless, sessionless protocol. However, most web server technologies implement a "session" construct on the server, using cookies or URL rewriting to preserve session across multiple HTTP requests.
 # sessions between devices within a personal zone, (Intra personal zone sessions)
 # sessions between applications and remote services (External services sessions)
 # sessions between two personal zones
 # user sessions on the webinos runtime which may move between devices (User centric distributed intent sessions)

### Background

There is no standard way to implement sessions over traditional HTTP browser, web server connections. Almost all web server application frameworks (ASP, Java, PHP) will create their own session constructs on top, but natively HTTP (being a stateless protocol) does not support it. This omission comes with its drawbacks, which are outlined in the Threats section below.

Within webinos the type 2 and type 3 sessions, which are the two critical communication layers in a distributed webinos flow, are defined to run exclusively over TLS. This provides both strong integrity and authentication for the session life-cycle, at the expense of some performance.

Type 2 and 3 sessions are low level implementation constructs that are not visible at the end user level

The final class of sessions to be considered from a security perspective is the distributed notion of a session, as a user completes one specific activity, over a number of different devices. This is something new that webinos is introducing, that needs proper exploration.

#### Requirements

-   Requirement "ID-USR-OXFORD-34":http://dev.webinos.org/redmine/projects/wp2-2/wiki/DeliverableVersionAll#ID-USR-OXFORD-34 implies that session data must remain private, as it contains device identifiers.
-   Requirement "DA-DEV-ambiesense-048":http://dev.webinos.org/redmine/projects/wp2-2/wiki/DeliverableVersionAll#DA-DEV-ambiesense-048 indicates that session data will move between devices
-   Requirement "PS-USR-Oxford-71":http://dev.webinos.org/redmine/projects/wp2-2/wiki/DeliverableVersionAll#PS-USR-Oxford-71 "PS-USR-Oxford-68":http://dev.webinos.org/redmine/projects/wp2-2/wiki/DeliverableVersionAll#PS-USR-Oxford-68 require the webinos runtime to have ultimate control over session instantiation and closure, which can be triggered from events.
-   Requirement "CAP-DEV-FHG-204":http://dev.webinos.org/redmine/projects/wp2-2/wiki/DeliverableVersionAll#CAP-DEV-FHG-204 indicates that session data can be stored outside the device.

#### Threats

Sessions require protection because the hijacking or unauthorised disclosure of a session can have security and privacy implications. Session data may contain private information, but more importantly it may be possible to use a hijacked session to impersonate a user on an application. This could then lead to the disclosure of further security or privacy-sensitive data, as well as potential damage to digital assets. This is discussed in [[Deliverable_Background#OWASP-threats|OWASP Threat A3 in the Background section]] of this document. Good examples of session hijacking are the Firesheep application ([[Deliverable_References#Firesheep|Firesheep]]) and FaceNiff android application ([[Deliverable_References#FaceNiff|FaceNiff]]) which are both capable of intercepting insecure browser sessions with social networking websites.

Traditional browser-web server HTTP sessions, that are based upon cookies, or dynamic URL rewriting are extremely vulnerable to impersonation attacks. Because HTTP does not support session and session authentication natively, each application developer is free to continually make the same mistakes. Mitigating against this threat is, therefore, very hard as it requires either

1.  a complete re-education of web developers everywhere, or
2.  the introduction of new technologies which help mitigate against the issues

The approach taken in webinos is the latter. The webinos session layers covering intra personal zone traffic and external services traffic are intended to provide useful tools which attract diligent developers away from the more dangerous technologies.

Specifically, webinos sessions (type 2+3) offer the following advantages

-   All traffic between zones and services is encrypted to make snooping traffic more difficult.
-   All client server sessions are mutually authenticated. This mutual authentication includes, user and device
-   All traffic can be monitored at the PZH for anomolies. For example sudden changes in IP address, can be challenged be asking the device to re-authenticate. This helps mitigate against real time token stealing attacks

This means that all traffic within a zone or between zones is encrypted according in webinos.

The principle adopted in webinos is one of gradual change, to be encouraged by offering both useful and secure alternatives to conventional techniques. Attempting to _switch off_ traditional cookie based web server sessions overnight would be too disruptive; this might put webinos uptake at risk.

However, by offering viable alternatives to traditional session techniques, with proven security advantages, programmers can be encouraged to move to a more robust platfrom.

### Specifications

#### Types of session

Session types are formally defined in the Architecture sub section. [[wp3-1:Webinos session creation]]

#### Synchronisation

Intra zone sessions, are worthy of specific security consideration, due the the sensitivity of the information to be exchanged.

As per the specification it is defined that over a PZP-PZH session the following data should be synchronised.

1.  shared authentication tokens for users, devices, services.
2.  user data
3.  application specific data
4.  context events and stream

Each of these items is obviously highly sensitive, and creates major issues if leaked.

The first thing to note is that within the webinos architecture, we have improved upon the current state of the art, in that the 3rd party application developer no longer has direct access to this data. This is especially important for authentication tokens and session ids. This information is now stored within the trusted component (the PZP) and the application developer now only has indirect access to this data.

As stated however, the PZP now becomes highly trusted. Within the implementation of the PZP, we must take great care to ensure that

-   all communications with the PZH is done so over secure communication channels
-   all data stored/cached at the PZP is at least encrypted, and in an ideal world is delegated to a trusted storage
-   the PZP itself is developed to have strong integrity check built in or around it, to limit the forms of attack that can be made against it.

### Future Directions

We intend to continue to monitor new threats and vulnerabilities to session protocols and investigate further mechanisms for securing device identity keys.
