Introduction
============

The webinos project delivers a cross-platform web application runtime environment; it provides standard JavaScript APIs as well as inter-device communication and interaction. The development of this runtime environment will help to provide a seamless end-user experience for web applications across multiple devices. The webinos consortium aims to make several innovations in the runtime environment and, as a research project, it aims to go beyond the current state of the art in web application technology.

One of the most important areas for improvement in existing web application technology is the provision of better security and privacy. webinos-enabled web applications will be able to support important and high value functionality such as electronic payment and may store confidential and valuable information belonging to companies or individuals. At the same time, vulnerabilities in web technology are being discovered regularly, with large projects such as OWASP ([[D036_References#OWASP|OWASP]]) dedicated to cataloguing and mitigating the most common and severe. Furthermore, user privacy is an increasing concern, and mobile applications frequently appear in the news for violating user expectations for how their data are collected and used ([[D036_References#Leyden2011|Leyden2011]]).

A key challenge facing the webinos project is that existing threats to security and privacy could potentially have a greater impact on webinos than on existing systems, due to the capability for cross-device interaction and standardised architecture. From the outset we have been aware that an insecure webinos platform could result in the creation of cross-device malware. This malware could capture sensitive private information or commercially valuable data or even create a large, cross-platform botnet capable of launching denial of service attacks against people and organisations. These threats are real, and must be solved in the webinos architecture. The webinos project has therefore been considering security and privacy issues from the beginning, and this document represents the rationale behind the webinos specifications with regards to security and privacy.

There is another compelling reason for the creation of a webinos security and privacy architecture: the standardisation of security and privacy controls and interfaces which will increase usability and reduce development effort. At present, each device manufacturer provides different interfaces and conceptual models for securing applications and protecting users. This makes the task of securing all personal devices challenging for users. By unifying the interface and allowing the management of security policies on all devices to be done on the most appropriate platform (on a device with a large screen and keyboard, for example) users will be able to make better decisions than they can at present.

In a departure from the approach taken in the previous year’s report (the D3.5 deliverable), this document does not provide specification material relating to the webinos security and privacy framework. This can be found in related specifications ([[D036_References#Webinos-D33|Webinos-D33]]) and ([[D036_References#Webinos-D34|Webinos-D34]]) and aims to be a precise, implementable description of how webinos is designed and should work in practice. Instead, this document describes the rationale and background to the webinos specifications with regards to security and privacy. It identifies the risks and threats facing webinos, explains how these are mitigated and what the residual issues are. It contains detailed information about cloud security an privacy issues and how they affect the webinos architecture. It also lists specific security and privacy concerns with the APIs being developed by webinos and ways of mitigating them. This document is closely related to the specifications given above as well as the previous updates to webinos requirements ([[D036_References#Webinos-D25|Webinos-D25]]) and the User Expectations of Security and Privacy deliverables ([[D036_References#Webinos-D27|Webinos-D27]],[[D036_References#Webinos-D28|Webinos-D28]]).

Intended audience
-----------------

This deliverable provides _informative_ content for implementers of the webinos platform and webinos applications. This will help with any security and privacy analysis performed by individual stakeholders and organisations who may be considering deploying webinos.

Perhaps more importantly, this deliverable is useful for the webinos project itself in making sure that security and privacy threats are being mitigated by the architecture. It provides immediate recommendations and feedback to platform developers and API designers. This document represents a snapshot of the overall webinos development process, with some security and privacy issues in webinos addressed already and others still in progress. It is hoped that this work will be continued into the third year of the project.

Document structure
------------------

This document attempts to present the methodology and findings within the main sections, followed by references and an appendix containing source data. We begin by introducing the architectural risk analysis process, describing the methodology followed and the main results. These include an attack resistance analysis, ambiguity analysis, weakness analysis and additional work on securing data at rest. We then outline the threat model that has been adopted in the webinos architecture, defining the trusted and untrusted features of each component. Next, we address security and privacy issues directly related to APIs and their implementations, as well as how these have been addressed. Following this we present a substantial chapter on cloud security, relating primarily to webinos’ use of cloud services. We then make a set of recommendations to webinos stakeholders, and in the final section we conclude.

Attached are a set of appendices containing:

-   Background on related systems, academic papers and webinos deliverables
-   The full list of API threats
-   Architectural risk analysis data, including architectural patterns and attack patterns
-   Additional draft attacks and attack patterns that are yet to be fully included in the analysis
-   A complete set of actions used to inform the threat model
