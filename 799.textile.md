June 30 delivery
----------------

Wiki page prepared: "WP3.2 deliverable":http://79.125.104.127/redmine/projects/t3-2/wiki/WP_32_Deliverable

Please review and check your responsibilities.

-   Assure that API investigation information you are responsible for is accurate for the report: "API investigations per API category":http://79.125.104.127/redmine/projects/t3-2/wiki/Wiki#API-Categories
-   API specifications of your responsibility should be created and pushed to the Git repository: "Webinos API specifications Git repository":http://dev.webinos.org/specifications/draft/
-   Provide input to other sections of your responsibility.

Deadline May 30 as we need to review prior to Sophia Antipolis meeting. Also note that June 2 is a public holiday in Sweden and that June 2 and 3 are free days at SEMC. (This also applies to June 6, the Swedish national day, which we poor Webinos guys canâ€™t make use of due to the Sophia Antipolis meeting :-) )

Daniel offered to be editor (with input/help from Alexander, Dieter and Nick) on the sectio "Tools for API specifications":http://79.125.104.127/redmine/projects/t3-2/wiki/Tools_for_APIs_specifications

h2. API patterns and guidelines

"API guidelines":http://79.125.104.127/redmine/issues/194 â€“ Daniel

"Webinoscore API":http://dev.webinos.org/specifications/draft/webinoscore.html â€“ Claes.

Comments by e-mail from Dom and Dave.

The conclusions were:

* Section 3: â€œFunction onlyâ€ or â€œInterfaceâ€ callbacks in asynchronuos APIs.
â€œFunction onlyâ€ is the standard method here which we should use. However, â€œInterface callbacksâ€ provide for greater extensibility and could be used if we canâ€™t solve the problem with â€œFunction onlyâ€ callbacks.

* Section 3.2: Decide on â€œAsynchronous Methods Return Valuesâ€, i.e. â€œvoidâ€ or â€œpending operationâ€. Both types of return values are allowed. This depends on the needs of the API specified. Also note that we are not making a global definition of "pending operationâ€ as the semantics of the "cancel()" method depends on the actual API and can not be globally defined.

* Section 4: Decide on error handling options. There should be no common/global definition of error codes. Each specification should specify the error codes that are needed. (However, I don’t think we have an agreement on "exception error codes" vs "callback error codes", i.e. whether they are common or not within a specification. My personal view is that they are diffeernt things and in the sensor API I have specified SensorException and SensorCBError as different interfaces)

Regarding "Webinoscore API":http://dev.webinos.org/specifications/draft/webinoscore.html the conclusions mean that this specification remains very thin and just defines that the webinos interface is part of the window global object.

h2. Payment API

"Payment API":http://dev.webinos.org/specifications/draft/payment.html â€“ Christian.

Referring to e-mail discussion initiated by Dom.

This API was questioned by Dom as local resources (e.g. on-device hardware or services) are not accessed and the API could be implemeneted as a pure JS wrapper around the GSMA OneAPI RESTful payment API. Such a wrapper is best provided by JS library developers. Dom also statedt that we should have an impementation of this library prior to publishing as a specification.

Christian meant that there are political reasons for including the API in the deliverable, to show how Webinos can be used in a commercial environment.

The conclusion was that the Payment API will be included in the 3.2 delivery and that Christian should state, e.g. in the specifcation header, that this is a proposal/first attempt that not yet has been implemented.

h2. Event handling APIs â€“ Stefano Dâ€™Angelo

Event is basically a message that is sent to a local or remote entity. The event handling API should be agnostic to whether the entity to communicate with is local or remote. This is related to service discovery and could be seen as an extension to the service discovery API.

An example use case for event handling is the advertisment that a new Webinos service is available.

A low level eventing API inspired by the DOM event model is proposed by Stefano. See wiki page: "Informal low level event handling API attempt":http://79.125.104.127/redmine/projects/t3-2/wiki/Informal_low_level_event_handling_API_attempt. It is proposed that the API should support the following methods:

* Send event
* Forward event
* Add event listener
* Remove event listener

The conclusion was that Stefano should coordinate with Anders Isberg and Ziran Sun as this relates to discovery. The goal should be creation of a tangible Event handling API specification to be included in the WP 3.2 delivery.

h2. Application Execution APIs â€“ Michael Vakulenko.

See slide 7 in "Application Execution APIs investigation":http://dev.webinos.org/redmine/attachments/download/542/Webinos_T3.2_Execution_API_-_v0.01.ppt for proposed APIs for phase 1.

Three APIs proposed:

-   Launch installed Webinos application API
-   Check policies on launching Webinos applications (to be coordinated with John L)
-   Check if webinos application is installed in device

Michael plans to provide draft API specifications prior to June meeting.

Discovery API
-------------

Anders Isbergâ€™s proposal "ServiceDiscovery API":http://dev.webinos.org/specifications/draft/servicediscovery.html

Not dealt with as Anders on vacation.

Context adaptation APIs â€“ George Gionis
-----------------------------------------

George not on call but Ronny is working on a User profile API. First draft planned to be published tomorrow.

AOB

WP 3.2 slot at June meeting. Proposed is:

Tuesday 15:00-17:00 Task 3.2
Wednesday 09:30-12:30 Task 3.2

Claes suggested a short common status report and the rest of time work in small groups for API review and discusions.
