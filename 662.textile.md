Mock-ups (wireframes)
---------------------

### Definition

Web site wireframes are blue prints that define a Web pageâ€™s content and functionality. They do not convey design - e.g. colors, graphics, or fonts.

### Tools

There are a lot of tools to create wireframes. Since we only need very basic wireframes, Microsoft Visio should suffice.

#### Microsoft Visio

To create wireframes we use Visio, with some additional design elements. These design elements can be found in attached zip file (Wireframes_Visio.zip).
You include these by opening the vss files and the wireframe.vst file in Visio.
The wireframe_template.vsd file contains an example of a wireframe for a web page.

Examples of GUIS
----------------

Find attached some examples of what GUIs might look like (minimal effort to make these look nice, just to demonstrate what kind of interfaces should be available)

Example mock-ups (for websites)
-------------------------------

See attached file Group11_Sitemap_Wireframes.docx. This document contains the sitemaps and wireframes for a desktop and mobile site. This is a document created by students at IBCN (part of IBBT).
