Specification structure
-----------------------

This page contains a proposal for WP3.2 phase 1 delivery: "APIs for WP3.2 phase 1":http://79.125.104.127/redmine/projects/t3-2/wiki/APIs_for_WP32_phase_1

Nick proposes a master index file that links to each specification included in our delivery. He also proposes that "wrapper" specifications should be created when we refer to existing W3C specifications similar to what WAC does with Geolocation ("WAC Geolocation":http://www.wacapps.net/web/portal/wac-2.0-spec). This makes it possible for us to include additional statements related to remote access to the API and security.
