API specification alignment with task 4.1 API implementations and further work on the APIs
==========================================================================================

Our API specifications need to be aligned with what we actually implemented in task 4.1. Furthermore, for referred API specifications, we should feedback our implementation experiences to the original organization owning the specification, e.g. W3C.

This wiki summarizes differences in the API implementations compared to the task 3.2 API specifications at "Webinos phase 1 API specifications":http://dev.webinos.org/specifications/draft/. The API implementation status could be found at "WP4 delivery status":http://dev.webinos.org/redmine/projects/wp4/wiki/Delivery_status. Any other suggestions for improvements of the API should also be stated.

For each API the main responsible API editor is also stated. This is a preliminary proposal. Please provide feedback on this.

"The Context module":http://dev.webinos.org/specifications/draft/context.html
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Differences in task 4.1 implementation compared with task 3.2 specification (phase 1 API)

In the 3.1 deliverable for context the focus was on the integration of the Context API with the rest of the proposed (then) webinos architecture, together with a set of specifications revolving around the potential usage of the API by webinos applications, while providing a few points on the actual implementation architecture. It was soon discovered during 4.1 that there was an important strategic decision to be taken. The Context API had to leave part of the data handling of the contextual information to the application developers by providing a number of tools to create, store, extract and analyse contextual information, while at the same time provide automatic mechanisms that store contextual information already transferred throughout the platform. The result was the introduction of the term and structure of "Context Object". A Context Object refers to a notion similar to a meme. It’s the minimum of data that are required to define any single personal contextual piece of information (e.g. MyLocation, MyHouse, MyFriend, MyFavoriteTVChannel etc).

The definitions of what pieces of data form a complete Context Object, where, when and how to find them are included in Context Vocabularies. These are text files in json structure. There are two forms of Context Vocabularies that were created in 4.1. The first one is the API Context Vocabulary, which is read-only to the application developer and contains definitions of Context Objects that utilise the RPC API calls that are made by applications to automatically store Context Objects. The second one is the Application Context Vocabulary, which contains the definitions of Context Objects created by applications. Application Context Objects are not stored automatically, but rather are requested to be stored by the application that defined each.

The Context Objects are flattened and stored on an SQLite3 database located on the PZH. If a connection to the PZH is not available (Virgin Mode), the data are stored in a temporary file as a buffer, until a connection to the PZH is available. The extraction of the Context Objects is performed via a custom SQL query builder created for the Context API. All the events relating to Context pass through the Policy Manager.

### Other suggestions for this API specification

The new requirements to be added include the registration of context objects to be extracted and stored locally per device, either based on simple extraction rules or more complex rules that describe Context Objects as results of more complex queries, without the requirement of a connection with the PZH. For example, a statistical rule applied on the MyLocations Context Objects can generate a more permanent Context Object called MyHome or MyWorkPlace.

Another requirement is the addition of a background service that will store API Context Objects while the PZP is running and without an application making specific API calls. The registration of such listeners should be implemented in the same way that Application Context Objects are defined through the Policy Manager.

Additionally, with the advancement of the Policy Manager and the ability to create more complex policy rules, each Context API call will have a number of policy events relating to it in the following axes:

-   Context API Method
-   Read/Write
-   Application making the request
-   Data Object (Context Object, rule to be added/updated etc)

"The events module":http://dev.webinos.org/specifications/draft/events.html
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Responsible editor

Andre Paul / Fraunhofer

### Differences in task 4.1 implementation compared with task 3.2 specification (phase 1 API)

-   forwarding messages is not implemented
-   cc / bcc for the adressing fields is not implemented
-   caching is not implemented
-   API implementation design currently relies on permanent availability of the event API service (should run on PZH)
-   WebinosEventEntity is not yet clearly defined (how to address a certain application, where to get the own application ID that can be used by others to send messages)

### Other suggestions for this API specification

-   simplify API through removal of forwarding and cc/bcc parts from the spec.

"The AppLauncher module":http://dev.webinos.org/specifications/draft/launcher.html
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Responsible editor

Andre Paul / Fraunhofer

### Differences in task 4.1 implementation compared with task 3.2 specification (phase 1 API)

-   appInstalled() and PendingOperation/cancel is not implemented
-   do we need a speparation between application ID as in config.xml and an instance of an application (what if we have installed two services or applications of the same type)?
-   implementation currently just takes arbitrary (system depended) arguments, thus, implementation is nut inter-operable
-   since we do not have widget run-times yet its not possible to start webinos applications using this API

### Other suggestions for this API specification

For August 31 delivery no changes will be done but in the longer term we should consider to use Web-intents instead.

"The messaging module":http://dev.webinos.org/specifications/draft/messaging.html
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Responsible editor

Fraunhofer (Christian Fuhrhop)

### Differences in task 4.1 implementation compared with task 3.2 specification (phase 1 API)

Implementation on Android done for sms.
More problematic for mms since no apis available. Reading mms can be done with a direct access to android db (difficult to find a clear documentation on this); not yet investigated how to send mms.

### Other suggestions for this API specification

Removed two obvious bugs from spec (wrong ID number on TYPE_IM, double sendMessage definition).
WAC has now added ‘isInSync’ attribute and ‘sync()’ method to MsgAttachment interface. We probably should copy that.

"The NFC module":http://dev.webinos.org/specifications/draft/nfc.html
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

### Responsible editor

Hans Myrhaug / Ambisense, Stefano Vercelli / TIM, Dave Raggett / W3C

### Differences in task 4.1 implementation compared with task 3.2 specification (phase 1 API)

The 3.2 specification for the NFC API was never implemented. Some preliminary work was done on Linux with integrating node.js and libnfc, using a usb stick for the NFC reader. Some experiments were also conducted on the Nexus S phone using the Android NFC API. The original plan was to then get up to speed with the build process for the webinos personal zone proxy and then work on implementing the NFC API as specified in the 3.2 deliverable. Unfortunately, other work items got in the way. Some progress was made on building the PZP for Android using Ant on Linux, but this proved harder than expected.

### Other suggestions for this API specification

To develop a new version of the NFC API aligned to the anticipated direction for the "proposed W3C NFC Working Group":http://www.w3.org/2012/05/nfc-wg-charter.html and background as set out in the "W3C NFC wiki":http://www.w3.org/2009/dap/wiki/Near_field_communications_(NFC)

-   Reading NDEF messages
-   Writing NDEF messages
-   Setting NFC tags to read-only
-   Formatting NDEF compatible NFC tags
-   Peer to peer push of NDEF messages between NFC devices
-   Peer to peer HTML message channel between NFC devices supporting LLCP
-   Application Program Data Unit (APDU) support
-   Card emulation support, e.g. for APDU based operations

The API will build upon ideas in the B2G, PhoneGap, Tizen, and webinos phase 1 APIs for NFC. One particular goal will be to read and write to specific NFC tags when there are multiple tags within the range of the NFC device, e.g. as can happen when there are several cards with NFC tags in your wallet. It remains to be seen how easy it will be to implement support for LLCP, APDU and card emulation. It is likely that this may not be possible for all webinos supported platforms.

"The payment module":http://dev.webinos.org/specifications/draft/payment.html
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Responsible editor

Fraunhofer (Christian Fuhrhop)

### Differences in task 4.1 implementation compared with task 3.2 specification (phase 1 API)

Implemented for dummy payment and for GSMA payment API.
BlueVia implementation started but never finished.

### Other suggestions for this API specification

No usable handling for Payment Provider interface page - possibly not
attainable with current structure. (In many cases payment providers
require a redirect to their web page - something the PZP can’t handle
itself, but probably needs to be covered by the application itself.)
Also, payment providers usually direct back to the original web page,
which is a somewhat vague concept for a locally running web app.

"The Sensors module":http://dev.webinos.org/specifications/draft/sensors.html
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Responsible editor

Claes Nilsson - SoMC

### Differences in task 4.1 implementation compared with task 3.2 specification (phase 1 API)

All changes applies to the implementation for Android.

-   Skipped normalized values in sensor event as I did’t see any use for them. See http://dev.webinos.org/specifications/draft/sensors.html#::sensors::SensorEvent

-   I didn’t implement exception with raises as this is not supported by the latest widl-specification: http://dev.w3.org/2006/webapi/WebIDL/#idl-exceptions. DOM exceptions to be used instead.

-   Implemented more sensor types based on Android sensor API (proximity, humidity). I also implemented support for orientation related sensors (accelerometer, gyro, compass) to facilitate testing. However, these sensor types should not be included in the API specification as these sensors are covered by the DeviceOrientation API and we shouldn’t confuse developers.

### Other suggestions for this API specification

-   W3C is currently specifying a set of small sensor specific APIs for typical in-device sensors such as proximity, ambient light, ambient humidity, ambient temperature, etc. We should consider to use these APIs for these sensor types instead of the generic Webinos sensor API

-   We should add new sensor types for external sensors:
    -   Heart rate monitor (Ziran provide link to use case?)
    -   M2M sensors (Notes from Stefano Vercelli follow):
        -   For m2m applications we need to support many different sensors; we can add some of them to specs (sensors for Arduino boards), but leave it open for developers to add their own;
        -   Add to ConfigureSensorOptions interface a generic configuration string (json formatted) that can be specified for every new sensor in case they need particular configurations;
        -   We need a different way to set data rate of sensor. It can be an unsigned long; if equal to 0 means send an event when the value changes, otherwise it’s number of ms between two events; we may need to configure a sensor to send an event once a day…
        -   Input from Stefano for needed sensors expected.

-   Other proposed changes:
    -   Align with latest W3C approach to event based APIs, see for example "W3C Battery Status API":http://dvcs.w3.org/hg/dap/raw-file/tip/battery/Overview.html
    -   Add humidity sensor type (if we not use the W3C API instead)
    -   Clarify that remove EventListener should be used to stop listening. Example?
    -   Specify a default value for â€œrateâ€, e.g. SENSOR_DELAY_UI

-   If Webinos supports Web Intents a a generic means for users to select sensors in response to application requests would be possible. This would allow for the use of sensors on different devices, either on the local area network, or remote, somewhere on the Internet.

"The discovery module":http://dev.webinos.org/specifications/draft/servicediscovery.html
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Responsible editor

Alexander FutÃ¡sz/Franhofer

### Differences in task 4.1 implementation compared with task 3.2 specification (phase 1 API)

Not implemented are:
* DiscoveryInterface: getServiceId, createService
* Service: The constants are missing, state (is there but unused)
* FindCallback: onLost
* BindCallback: onUnbind, onServiceAvailable, onServiceUnavailable, onError (though these could have been implemented by individual services)
* PendingOperation
* Discovery across multiple Personal Zones (PZs)

Other changes:
* DiscoveryInterface.findServices From the filter parameter just the zoneId property is used.
* Service.bind is ambiguous as JavaScript defines a bind functions for all JavaScript objects. Therefore Service.bind is renamed to Service.bindService.
* Service.bindService doesn’t respect the optional serviceId argument.

### Other suggestions for this API specification

It would be good to be able to use wildcards when searching for ServiceTypes. For example right now it’s not possible to find all services, no matter what the ServiceType may be. Also the Sensor API has multiple ServiceTypes which are similar but different, so it’s not possible to search for all Sensor services.

Maybe get rid of the mechanism that allows to bypass calling findServices by using createService and then binding the created service by using a previously stored serviceId. Seems nobody had use for this so far, also this bypass kind of defeats the purpose of a **discovery** mechanism.

"The tv module":http://dev.webinos.org/specifications/draft/tv.html
---------------------------------------------------------------------

### Responsible editor

Martin Lasak - Franhofer

### Differences in task 4.1 implementation compared with task 3.2 specification (phase 1 API)

-   Added getScreenshot(base64 pic) interface to return a screenshot, base64 coded, of the current channel. (Paolo)

### Other suggestions for this API specification

*Martin:*
After reviewing the new TV Control API [1] and due to problems with the old spec from development point of view i would take the chance and suggest two changes to this API:

Webidl excerpt (IS):

dictionary Channel {
 ChannelType channelType;
 DOMString name;
 DOMString longName;
 Stream stream;
 TVSource tvsource;
};

Webidl excerpt (SHOULD BE):

dictionary Channel {
 ChannelType channelType;
 DOMString name;
 DOMString longName;
 MediaStream stream;
};

Reason for using MediaStream type is to be better aligned with WebRTC. Stream is not definded elsewhere anyway (maybe provoking confusion and in reality/implementation just â€œcastedâ€ to DOMString ;)

Reason for excluding the tvsource attribute: get rid of a cyclic structure that shows up very unhandy when trying to serialize the Channel object (e.g. JSON.stringify throws an exception). Imo we wonâ€™t lose much.

A last remark: even if it is not specified, on the implementation side a unique identifier for a channel is needed. So my question is do we need to specify such an object? Such a identifier should not point uniquely to a certain frequency/bearer/technology but should uniquely identify the Channel object itself.

*Alexander:* I agree with Martinâ€™s proposed changes. The cyclic property structure indeed holds some problems and might have been not considered when designing the spec.

*Paolo:* Having a getScreenshot(base64 pic) interface to return a screenshot, base64 coded, of the current channel. Or instead of a screenshot a poster it’s either way’s fine with me and doesn’t look like a fallback. I think that adding it would also be useful for all the social related, upcoming apps that might need this feature.

"The userprofile module":http://dev.webinos.org/specifications/draft/userprofile.html
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Responsible editor

Ronny GrÃ¤fe - Deutsche Telecom

### Differences in task 4.1 implementation compared with task 3.2 specification (phase 1 API)

The UserProfile API is not implemented in phase 1 of WP4.

### Other suggestions for this API specification

OpenID implementation. OpenID was already implemented for PZH demo. After investigations it is clear, that it could be used for userprofile (see "OpenID Attribute Exchange" http://openid.net/specs/openid-attribute-exchange-1_0.html)

"The vehicle module":http://dev.webinos.org/specifications/draft/vehicle.html
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Responsible editor

### Differences in task 4.1 implementation compared with task 3.2 specification (phase 1 API)

-   need to add LightEvents and StatusEvents as additions to the ControlEvents

"The widget module":http://dev.webinos.org/specifications/draft/widget.html
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Responsible editor

Andre Paul - Fraunhofer

### Differences in task 4.1 implementation compared with task 3.2 specification (phase 1 API)

-   For Android the implementation complies to the original W3C Widget specification and the webinos additons are not implemented.
-   On other platforms it is not yet implemented (due to lack of widget run-times)
-   it depends on 3.3 work if the webinos extensions will be kept in the phase II release

### Other suggestions for this API specification

-   webinos extension defines notify() function in order to notify the user that something happened. We should consider to replace this with W3C Web Notifications API http://dev.w3.org/2006/webapi/WebNotifications/publish/Notifications.html

"The ContactsWrapper module":http://dev.webinos.org/specifications/draft/contacts.html
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Responsible editor

Christian Fuhrhop - Fraunhofer (specifications), Paolo Vergori - ISMB (alignment)

### Differences in task 4.1 implementation compared with task 3.2 specification (phase 1 API)

Contacts API has been implemented in WP4.1 introducing further level of abstraction, to what has been specified in WP3.2.
The only method that the wrapper exports is the _Find_ function. This method has been implemented exactly like specification says. The difference it’s that this method isn’t exposed directly, but an intermediate level, named _contactsModule.js_, is in charge of distinguish between local contacts and remote contacts. The names that has been given was just purely to separate two completely different implementations: Thunderbird and Google. Therefore, the exposed methods accepts an object, named _parameters_, that has a _parameter.type_ propriety to do this dichotomous choice.
Moreover, the _parameters_ has the contact proprieties in it, in order to apply the filter, as a first parameter of the _find_. Afterwards, a function named _makeW3Ccontacts_ proceed to translate a contact in a W3C Contact type.
The decision to introduce this abstraction level was taken, in order to support multiple implementations for different contacts services.

### Other suggestions for this API specification

Note: This is a W3C DAP WG specification and proposed changes should be input to W3C DAP or System Level API WG.

-   Add create, add, update and delete for contacts. This is not included in the original W3C Contacts API as this API is to be used in the pure browser context. However, with the policy based API access control system in Webinos writable contacts could be added without without violating security.
-   Change W3C style find function to WAC style findContacts function to be more consistent with new functions.
-   Move API from ‘wrapper’ APIs to webinos API, since it’s now a mixture of W3C and WAC elements and no longer just a wrapper around W3C stuff.

"The Calendar module":http://dev.webinos.org/specifications/draft/calendar.html
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Responsible editor

TBD

### Differences in task 4.1 implementation compared with task 3.2 specification (phase 1 API)

Not implemented in phase 1.

### Other suggestions for this API specification

Note: This is a W3C DAP WG specification and proposed changes should be input to W3C DAP or System Level API WG.

Follow W3C work on calendar APIs. It is expected that a Web Intents API for simplified access to calendars will be specified in the Device APIs Working Group, and a more complete solution in the proposed System Applications Working Group. As this work has not yet started within W3C it is proposed to keep the current reference to the existing Calendar API in the task 3.4 delivery.

"Device status module":http://dev.webinos.org/specifications/draft/devicestatus.html and "Device status vocabulary":http://dev.webinos.org/specifications/draft/vocabulary.html
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Responsible editor

Christian Furhop/Fraunhofer

### Differences in task 4.1 implementation compared with task 3.2 specification (phase 1 API)

-   The methods to watch for properties changes are not yet implemented.
-   Vocabulary is partially implemented

### Other suggestions for this API specification

Webinos phase 1 refers to WAC devicestatus module and has an Webinos version of the WAC devicestatus vocabulary module that adds properties. However, the latest version of the WAC devicestatus module (http://specs.wacapps.net/devicestatus/index.html) includes the vocabulary.

For phase a Webinos version of latest version of the WAC devicestatus module including added properties has been created.

For the future consider aligment with W3C DAP Network information API (http://dvcs.w3.org/hg/dap/raw-file/tip/network-api/Overview.html) and Battery Status API (http://dvcs.w3.org/hg/dap/raw-file/tip/battery/Overview.html) and other coming device status APIs.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Responsible editor

Felix-Johannes Jendrusch - Fraunhofer

### Differences in task 4.1 implementation compared with task 3.2 specification (phase 1 API)

The current implementation is ahead of Task 3.2 specifications (see "APIs: The file reader module":http://dev.webinos.org/specifications/draft/filereader.html, "APIs: The file writer module":http://dev.webinos.org/specifications/draft/filewriter.html, and "APIs: The file system module":http://dev.webinos.org/specifications/draft/filedirandsystem.html) but behind current W3C WebApps WG Working and Editor’s Drafts (see "File API":http://dev.w3.org/2006/webapi/FileAPI/, "File API: Writer":http://www.w3.org/TR/file-writer-api/, "File API: Directories and System":http://www.w3.org/TR/file-system-api/). Currently, the three specifications don’t match, or, taking Editor’s Drafts into account, are subject to more or less heavy changes.

I recommend to wait until all three specifications match again. Furthermore, I propose to tighten integration between webinos’s and the Browser’s File API, e.g., reuse the Browser’s Blob object.

### Other suggestions for this API specification

The proposed changes (better integration between webinos and the Browser) are webinos-only features and not required to be input to W3C WebApps WG.

"The authentication module":http://dev.webinos.org/specifications/draft/authentication.html
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Responsible editor

Andrea Atzeni / Polito

### Differences in task 4.1 implementation compared with task 3.2 specification (phase 1 API)

-   All API methods use callback. In task 3.2 specification, only _authentication()_ uses callback.
-   _isAuthenticated()_ should check the authentication freshness, instead actually it reports only if a user is authenticated or not.
-   Currently there is not integration with policies.
-   Not mentioned in the specification, _authenticate()_ performs a persistent authentication (since it interacts with the underlying system, it is valid also for other application in the same PZP)
-   API methods receive the username as a parameter.

### Other suggestions for this API specification

#### Check authentication freshness

-   Considering that _getAuthenticationStatus()_ can return _lastAuthTime_, combining it with _isAuthenticated()_ the application can choose what interval is admissible. Currently the application can’t force the reauthentication, so if the user is already authenticated but the application decide that the authentication is expired, the application can’t use authentication API to authenticate the user.
    -   A solution could be to allow the application to reset the authentication status or to force the reauthentication, but these features could expose authentication API to misuses.
-   Embedding authentication time evaluation inside _isAuthenticated()_, the webinos platform can mandate a time interval in spite of the application (developer) will.
    -   Since this seems a kind of policy task associated to the authentication, it could be better to delegate it to the policy manager. For example _isAuthenticated()_ could call the policy manager with the user as a subject and a new authentication API feature as a resource. The policy manager could call _getAuthenticationStatus()_ to know _lastAuthTime_ and return a "deny" if the authentication is expired.

#### Specification independent suggestions

The API should use OS provided authentication mechanisms. The possibility to use PAM under linux and MacOS was investigated.

#### API usage scenario

"The gallery module":http://dev.webinos.org/specifications/draft/gallery.html
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Responsible editor

Stefano Vercelli (Telecom Italia)

### Differences in task 4.1 implementation compared with task 3.2 specification (phase 1 API)

Only partial implementations done in task 4.1.

### Other suggestions for this API specification

In phase 1 Webinos adopted w3c gallery api (http://dev.w3.org/2009/dap/gallery/). This spec now has been shelved, so we are checking other specs to refer to.
The following table summarizes some possible solutions:

|**Candidate existing API**|**Short Description**|**Implementation Status**|**Gaps**|**Notes**|
|Mozilla DeviceStorage (https://wiki.mozilla.org/WebAPI/DeviceStorageAPI)|It’s a simple filesystem api|||Not interesting for our needs|
|w3c gallery (web intent based): https://dvcs.w3.org/hg/dap/raw-file/16185b62381d/gallery/index.html ||||If webinos does not support web intents, we should skip this api|
|Tizen mediaContent (https://developer.tizen.org/help/index.jsp?topic=%2Forg.tizen.help.web.api.device%2Ftizen%2Fmediacontent.html)|It is a more complete version of the shelved w3c api|||Suggestion is to select it for webinos|
||||||

The Mozilla DeviceStorage api is a filesystem api with less functionalities than the w3c filesystem apis we adopted; so it’s not interesting for our purposes.
The Tizen mediaContent api is similar to the gallery api previously adopted; it also adds some functionalities (for example the possibility to edit some metadata of the media object).
The new w3c gallery (based on web intents).
