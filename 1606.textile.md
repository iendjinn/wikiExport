Shared Personal Zone Devices
============================

This page describes an approach suggested by Dave Raggett and John Lyle to handle the existence of shared devices in webinos which ought to be accessible from multiple personal zones.

There are two complementary approaches on this page: first, multiplexing one device to a small set of well-known users. second: handling the privacy and security issues associated with public-facing devices such as a TV in a public or shared space.

Sharing _Personal_ Devices: Example Scenarios
-------------------------------------------------------

1.  Peter has teenage children. They want to be able to view their videos on their computers on the family Smart TV. It would make sense for the TV to be part of their personal zone, although Peter may want to remain in control. There are some shared resources on this TV: such as any attached media, and the TV channel selection.
2.  Georg and his wife share one car. Both are equal owners, but have their own personal zones for other devices.
3.  Anna lives in a shared student dormitory, with a common TV. Each student wants to be able to access the TV from their other devices, to see what is currently on, and to share their own media with the TV on occasion.

#### Anti-Solutions

-   A "shared zone" concept, which is a zone unlike a "personal zone". This seems messy and has many unanswered questions: where is the hub for a shared zone? Who administers it?
-   Mediate everything by policy, and ignore the zone concept as much as possible. This is also messy and involves using increasingly complex policies. it does not provide a useful abstraction for end users, developers or us.
-   Allow a device (without modification) to be in multiple personal zones. This might work, but the conflict of multiple zones, policies, synchronised data (etc) would become messy without a layer of indirection

#### Proposed solution: virtual devices

We propose that each shared device should have multiple virtual instances, one for each personal zone of the person who wants to use it. Each user would therefore have a _version_ of the physical device in their personal zone. Each version would look like a fully fledged device, but would just be pointing to one physical device, which would need to maintain the context of the current virtual instance. A virtual device can only be created with the approval of the owner of the device. A virtual device may have limited capabilities - e.g. some APIs might be disabled by a forced, top-level policy. An object diagram is shown below of how this might work:

<div class="uml">

PhysicalDevicePZP "1" **— "many" VirtualDevicePZP<br/>
 PhysicalDevicePZP : VirtualDevicePZP getVirtualDevices()<br/>
 PhysicalDevicePZP : XACML virtualDevicePolicies<br/>
 PhysicalDevicePZP : boolean policyCheck(action)<br/>

 VirtualDevicePZP : URI thisAddress<br/>
 VirtualDevicePZP : UserIdentity zoneUser<br/>
 VirtualDevicePZP : URI zoneHubAddress<br/>
 VirtualDevicePZP : Data synchronisedData<br/>
 VirtualDevicePZP : boolean isDeviceOwner()<br/>
 VirtualDevicePZP : XACML policies<br/>

</div>

In a proper class diagram, a VirtualDevicePZP and PhysicalDevicePZP would both inherit from class PZP.

When the device was being used directly (e.g. when Anna is sitting in front of the TV) there would be a need for authentication to access her virtual device resources.

We note that this abstraction could be used for all device sharing scenarios. E.g. if Alice wants to access Bob’s phone, she might "add" a virtual version of it to her personal zone. This may not always be appropriate, though.

We also note that this is similar to the concept of a user account that currently exists, and on some platforms could simply be implemented in this way. Perhaps the difference is that devices are held beneath the user account.


h4. Virtual device hosting on the PZH and support for the Dumb / Super-dumb device model

One implementation option is to allow a virtual instance of a device to be hosted elsewhere (e.g. on the personal zone hub). This would be useful for devices which are relatively low power and might save computation. This concept might be integrated with the implementation of dumb devices and super-dumb devices. This concept was also described early on in the project.

There are disadvantages: if the virtualised device is on a PZH, there is a need to synchronise the state of the virtualised device with the physical device. This might fail: e.g. if the device is off, or if something has changed remotely. There may also be contention with other users.


h4. Security issues


** Each virtual device would need to be isolated from one-another on the physical device. This might be implemented through virtualisation, multiple instances of node.js in separate threads, or through one instance which maintains a context object of some kind.
**** While this appears similar to the problem of having a single PZH host with multiple instances, the threats are quite different.
**** In the home TV scenario, only a few known (and socially connected) people would have access to a shared device, and therefore trust is implicit (to some extent - a lot of crime occurs between people who know each other!)
**** In the public shared device scenario, it would be necessary to limit the amount of data that is synchronised to a virtual instance. That, or the virtual instance would need to be hosted on a trusted device (this is quite a good option)
* Virtual devices would still be at the whim of someone with physical access, in many cases, so probably shouldn’t be trusted in their entirety.
* The _owner_ of the physical device would need to be able to administer the set of virtual devices available, and their permissions. This also implies the ability to add, revoke and remove a virtual device. Being able to add a device to your personal zone would need to be an explicit policy setting.
* Many users might be the owners of the device - for instance, with a shared car between husband and wife

#### Bootstrapping

When a new device is bought, we assume that it has just one owner at this stage.

The owner installs a PZP. At this stage, a new virtual instance is created with ownership privileges. This "owned" instance gives access to the admin features, including the ability to grant other users access to new virtual instances.

Subsequent users must request access to this device. This may involve the creation of a virtual instance, or just the creation of a policy rule for one particular API access. If it involves

#### Parental controls

"Virtual device" is a way to implement parental controls, as the parent may own the device and set policies to be enforced on the virtual device instance belonging to the child. Indeed, the parent might set policies that should apply to all devices the child has access to.

Sharing _Public_ (or _Publically Visible_) Devices - Context-sensitive displays.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

An extremely shared device, such as a dormitory TV, or even on devices with occasional guests (the family TV or car) there is a need to treat the output and input as "less trusted". This is something that applications will not be aware of - an application designed for a phone may make the assumption that only the owner will be capable of viewing or editing things.

#### Example misuse cases:

-   Justin is giving a business presentation through his tablet and a large monitor. However, when he is half-way through, his IM and Email apps interrupt the presentation and show some of the content of a recent email.
-   Alice’s friend is using her TV. She uses the browser, and notices that all of Alice’s bookmarks have been synchronised. These expose Alice’s secret fascination with Star Trek uniforms, which her friend finds distasteful.
-   Another of Alice’s friends is using her TV and decides to install some apps on it. He also fiddles with various other settings, such as her favourite channels, and downloads some premium content.
-   Helen uses a work tablet PC for various design work. She wants to use various personal apps, and wants to save her credentials for them (e.g. her Facebook username/password) to avoid re-entry Helen’s colleague Peter uses the same device, and accidentally logs into her apps and views her social network status and other personal details.

#### Problem analysis

The core problem is that certain devices don’t know who the end user is, whereas other devices can make strong assumptions about who is in control and viewing. Some devices can move between these two extremes: e.g. when there are additional passengers in a car, or if a PC is connected to a projector. Other devices might be personal OR private - e.g. a tablet shared by multiple people, or a TV might be in someone’s bedroom or lounge, which have different sharing assumptions.

#### Suggested solution

-   Some devices should be configured originally to assume they are in a shared context - e.g. TVs.
-   Context data could tell us whether other devices are in a shared visibility mode - e.g. when a TV is connected, or a car has multiple passengers
-   When devices are in a shared context, there could be an "incognito mode"-like session where user personalisations are largely ignored, and additional authentication is required for all actions. This might be akin to being "outside the zone". This is perhaps equivalent to when no virtual device instance is loaded, but when the device is still connected to various public services and local data sources.
