OpenID Attribute Exchange
=========================

As part of the OpenID authentication, the user information stored on the "openID":http://openid.net are gathered. as optional part of the authentication requests in an openID exchange. The schema is detailed in "http://openid.net/specs/openid-attribute-exchange-1_0.html":http://openid.net/specs/openid-attribute-exchange-1_0.html

An attribute is defined as a unit of personal identity information that is identified by a unique URI.
There is no mandatory schema about the kind of information attributes can carry in.

The information model is quite straightforward and details that an attribute is associated with a Subject Identifier (i.e. a URI that corresponds to the end-user identifier in the authentication portion of the messages), has a type identifier (again a URI) and a value (any kind of data in form of a utf8 string).

At least Google and Yahoo! support OpenID authentication.

Google uses the namespace aliases "ax" for these parameters, according to the documentation on so the code line required is of the type:
<pre>
 new openid.AttributeExchange({
 "http://axschema.org/contact/country/home": "required",
 "http://axschema.org/namePerson/first": "required",
 "http://axschema.org/pref/language": "required",
 "http://axschema.org/namePerson/last": "required",
 "http://axschema.org/contact/email": "required"
 })
</pre>

Yahoo can retrieve preferred language, nickname, full name, email and profile image (URL):
<pre>
 new openid.AttributeExchange({
 "http://axschema.org/pref/language": "required",
 "http://axschema.org/contact/email": "required",
 "http://axschema.org/namePerson/friendly": "required",
 "http://axschema.org/namePerson": "required",
 "http://axschema.org/media/image/default": "required"
 })
</pre>

Authenticating via Google the name of the PZH is generated concatenating firstName (http://axschema.org/namePerson/first) and lastName (http://axschema.org/namePerson/last).
Authenticating via Yahoo the name of the PZH is generated starting from the full name (http://axschema.org/namePerson OpenID attribute) and removing white spaces.
In both cases the email (http://axschema.org/contact/email) is used as a user identifier.
