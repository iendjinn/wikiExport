microPZP implementation examples
================================

A TLS-capable micro PZP may be implemented by subsetting the reference PZP implementation (based on node.js) but is more likely to use a more compact implementation based on a native implementation of the PZP core and relevant APIs. Such a native implementation has not been attempted in the webinos project to date.

The microPZP spec aims to permit implementation on very constrained hardware. We can think of three broad classes of hardware platform, although the distinctions between them are not clear-cut and these are only cited as examples.

The most capable devices will have:
* a high-level protected OS such as a variant of Linux, with code executed from RAM;
* a budget of 2Mb RAM for the micro PZP process;
* a budget of 2Mb of persistent storage for microPZP code and other associated persistent data.

Such devices will be TLS-capable and will, via a combination of hardware, software and physical security measures, be capable of securely storing enrolment credentials.

Intermediate devices might be embedded controllers with:
* a microcontroller running a real-time operating system such as Nucleus or OSE;
* code executed directly from flash storage, with a budget of 1Mb code space for microPZP code;
* a budget of 1Mb RAM for the microPZP process.

Such devices will also be TLS-capable and will similarly be capable of securely storing enrolment credentials.

The most constrained target devices will have:
* a microcontroller either running an embedded RTOS or with all application code linked into a single executable;
* 64kB of Flash for code;
* 16kB of SRAM.

These constrained devices would tethered to a net-connected PZP proxy via a bus such as RS232 serial or Bluetooth. In this last case, the microPZP would be a very tightly focused implementation of JSON-RPC for API and admin access, and a very compact implementation of the exported APIs.
