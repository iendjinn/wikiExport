Scenario 8 Sequence Diagram
===========================

<div class="uml">

title : Scenario 8nGeorge wants to listen to music stored on his mobile, through the set-top boxnbut this time using the set-top box as the controller

actor George
participant "George’s set-top-box" as George_set_top_box
participant "George’s mobile" as George_mobile

autonumber

note over George, George_mobile #FF6666
 this scenario differs from scenario 1 in the identification
 phase and in role exchange between set-top-box and mobile
end note

 identification 

group identification example
 George -> George_set_top_box : switch on
 George_set_top_box -> George : prompt for identity
 note over George, George_set_top_box : e.g. insert George WID
 George -> George_set_top_box : insert identity
end

 device discovery 

group device discovery example
 note over George, George_set_top_box : the user may set a policy to automaticallynstart device discovery
 George --> George_set_top_box : <font color="gray"><i>start device discovery</i></font>
 George_set_top_box -> George_mobile : broadcast hello message
 George_mobile -> George_set_top_box: hello response
end

 personal local cloud join 

note over George_set_top_box, George : the user may set a policy to automaticallynselect devices to autenticate and join.nthree possible solutions are:n- try to authenticate every sensed devicen- maintain a local membership listn- maintain a remote membership list
George_set_top_box -> George : <font color="gray">show available clouds and devices</font>
George -> George_set_top_box : <font color="gray">select the mobile</font>
George_set_top_box -> George_mobile : George’s set-top-box authentication
George_mobile -> George_set_top_box : George’s mobile authentication

note over George_set_top_box, George_mobile : personal cloud devices can use their shared secret tondistribute session keys and establish secure channels
George_set_top_box -> George_mobile : establish a secure channel

 service provision 

George -> George_set_top_box : ask for MP4 list
George_set_top_box -> George_mobile : MP4 list retrieval
George_mobile -> George_set_top_box : MP4 list transmission
George_set_top_box -> George : MP4 list display
George -> George_set_top_box : MP4 selection
George_set_top_box -> George_mobile : MP4 retrieval
George_mobile -> George_set_top_box : MP4 transmission
George_set_top_box -> George : MP4 consumption

REMARKS

How to establish the secure channel?

Personal cloud devices can use their shared secret to distribute session keys and establish secure channels.
They can use a pairwise session key for every channel and a common session key (personal-cloud-wise session key?) for broadcast communications.
When a device leave the cloud may be necessary to renew the broadcast key.
