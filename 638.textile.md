Context Application Layout Adaptation
=====================================

State of the Art

### Content adaptation

A lot of techniques for content adaptation have been considered. Some of these use a rule-based approach. He, J. et al. [23] use a method in which rules are selected from a rule base, based on client device parameters. These rules are then combined with an extensive analysis of the web page in which facts about the HTML code are extracted and inferred. In this paper, the rules are made for a specic content type, e.g. tables. Other works try to divide a page in segments based on their semantic relationships [20, 29, 30, 16]. By using the structured data from the web page and visual hints extracted from a rendered version of the page, it is divided into itâ€™s structural blocks. This division can be used to create a two-level hierarchical set of pages or as a basis for structure-level adaptation of the page.

### Context delivery

Mobile systems oer large possibilities for context-aware applications. By using microformats, small object-level transformations can be made to adapt community dependent data (e.g. dates, addresses) to the local semantics [25]. The Web 2.0 trend of mashups can be extended to creating context-aware mashups targeted to mobile devices [18]. Personalization in general web-based information systems [27] can also be used and extended to take a mobile deviceâ€™s added capabilities into account.

### Interaction optimization

By enabling automatic form lling, the limited input capabilities of mobile and ubiquitous devices can be overcome in some way [26]. Advanced interaction is possible on the iPhone with its multitouch capabilities and the Safari browser with the Webkit rendering engine that provides partial CSS3 support which allows 3D positioning. This allows a web technology-based implementation of a 3D carousel, an interaction method in which a set of cards seem to form a cylinder [17].
The next step in interaction optimization is multimodal interfaces. Englert, R. et al. developed an architecture that allows the development of native multimodal mobile applications [21]. Search giant Google recently release beta versions of Google Goggles [12] and Google Shopper [13], two products that rely on video and picture search instead of traditional search queries.

### Usability

Vigo, M. et al. [28] provide a method to evaluate web pages adapted for mobile, using the MobileOK tests from the W3C [10] as a basis. These tests are extended to take the device characteristics into account. Device features are retrieved from heterogeneous repositories.

### Semantics for (X)HTML

An optimal transformation of a web application can only be obtained when the source HTML le contains unambiguous, machine-interpretable semantic information about both the object and structure level. At the present, there are three methods to annotate or enhance an HTML page, that are both standardized (or are in the process of standardization) and are already being used in existing web applications: Microformats, RDFa an HTML 5.

#### Microformats

Microformats are tiny pieces of information that are injected into (X)HTML code by use of the class, rev and rel attributes. This way it promotes data reuse while reusing existing technologies. It is the most popular way to provide semantic annotations on a web page. Web 2.0 sites such as Twitter, Flickr, LinkedIn and Yahoo have already adopted microformats.
Microformats are developed according to an open standard called the microformat specications [8, 5, 24]. The invention of custom microformats outside of the community is discouraged, meaning a strict but limited vocabulary is available. This makes it easy to parse, but limits the extendibility in terms of our problem.
In the following example, the class attribute is used to indicate the presence of, respectively, a virtual card (vcard), a full name (fn) and a url (url).

<pre>
<p class="vcard">
Iâ€™m <span class="fn">Dieter Blomme</span> at
<a class="url" href="http://www.siruna.com/">siruna.com</a>.
</p>
</pre>

#### RDFa (Resource Description Framework in attributes)

RDFa [3, 2] is a modular extension of XHTML based on RDF [6], developed and proposed by the W3C. It allows a set of XML attributes to carry metadata about values in the human-readable text of a HTML page. Because it uses XML-specific properties, such as namespaces, it is unusable for the non-XML compliant HTML standard. RDFa is based on external domain vocabularies and thus promotes data reuse. It is still in an early adoption phase, but the number of RDFa enabled websites will rise quickly with the integration in the new versions of popular content management systems such as Drupal.
Unlike microformats, RDFa provides publisher independence and self containment. It allows application developer to develop and publish their own vocabularies, extend others and let a vocabulary evolve over time while still allowing maximum interoperability. The HTML and RDFa data are also separated. Research about the conversion of microformats to RDFa exists [1].
The figure below shows an example in which an existing vocabulary is used for the creation of an address card about one of the authors. The use of the property and rel tags here indicate a full name (foaf:name) and a homepage URL (foaf:homepage).

<pre>
<p xmlns:foaf="http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/" about="#me">
Iâ€™m <span property="foaf:name">Dieter Blomme</span> at
<a rel="foaf:homepage" href="http://www.siruna.com/">siruna.com</a>.
</p>
</pre>

#### HTML5 with Microdata

HTML 5 [7] is a standard in development by the W3C and is intended to be the successor for both HTML 4.01 and XHTML 1.0. It aims to reduce the need for plug-in based RIA technologies such as Flash, Silverlight and JavaFX, indirectly improving the possibility to search and adapt rich internet applications. It provides semantics, by replacing certain generic block and inline elements with new semantically improved tags. This will provide extended information about the structure of a web application, allowing an improved structure-level adaptation. Because the HTML5 standard is work in progress and is now in last call phase, browser support is still limited and the number of HTML 5 sites is small.
Microdata [14] is a feature of HTML5 that provides another way to embed semantic annotations. The example below shows the same address card annotated with microdata. The itemscope attribute indicates an individual item. The itemprop attribute has a similar function to the class attribute for microformats. A code example of HTML annotated with microdata to indicate a hcard is shown in the code below.

<pre>
<p itemscope itemtype="http://microformats.org/profile/hcard">
Iâ€™m <span itemprop="fn">Dieter Blomme</span> at
<a itemprop="url" href="http://www.siruna.com/"> siruna.com </a>.
</p>
</pre>
