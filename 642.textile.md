Plan for APIs to include in WP 3.2 phase 1 deliverable.
-------------------------------------------------------

According to the "Action 192":http://dev.webinos.org/redmine/issues/192 at the latest WP 3.2 call I have created a list of APIs that I consider candidates for phase 1: http://dev.webinos.org/redmine/projects/t3-2/wiki/APIs_for_WP32_phase_1. The list is based on input at the WP 3.2 wiki for the different API categories.

We need to set to scope for the delivery June 30 and allocate resources to fulfill this plan. Pointing at existing APIs is of course the easy piece but specifying new API or changes to existing APIs needs resources.

Being â€œEditor/Responsibleâ€ for an API specification means:
* For new specifications the â€œEditor/Responsibleâ€ shall create a draft specification using the tool chain that Nick currently is creating.
* Where we refer to an existing specification the â€œEditor/Responsibleâ€ must check if this existing specification fulfills Webinos requirements. If modifications are needed they shall be specified through a delta specification using the tool chain that Nick currently is creating.

For HW Resource APIs and Application Data APIs we have a reasonable good view on APIs needed based on WP 2 use cases and requirements. However, for the remaining API categories the picture is still unclear. This is natural since needed APIs strongly depends on the system architecture that we are defining in WP 3.1. Meanwhile we should work on the APIs listed at http://dev.webinos.org/redmine/projects/t3-2/wiki/APIs_for_WP32_phase_1 and assure that we have a set of draft specifications available at the end of June.

Discussions and decisions:

-   Geolocation API: Use W3C Geolocation API

-   Device Orientation API: Use W3C DeviceOrientation Event

-   "Generic" SensorActuator API: Claes will work on this. Work also in progress in W3C DAP. W3C goes for simple DOM event based APIs according to "W3C DeviceOrientation Event":http://dev.w3.org/geo/api/spec-source-orientation.html for system information and sensors. DAP’s first event based API is "Battery Status Event Specification":http://dev.w3.org/2009/dap/system-info/battery-status.html. As a working assumption Claes proposes to evaluate the event model for sensors. One major question is if a "generic" sensor event should be specified or if simple specific event based specification should be specified per sensor type supported. Claes to come back with a tangible proposal. "Task 164":http://79.125.104.127/redmine/issues/164

-   Device Status: One option is to base this on WAC device Status API. Another option is to follow the W3C approach on event based APIs adn specify a set a simple events exposing device status information Example "Network Information API":http://dev.w3.org/2009/dap/netinfo/Overview.html. Nick stated that we should what we do should be based on "WAC Device Status Vocabulary":http://specs.wacapps.net/2.0/feb2011/deviceapis/vocabulary.html

-   TV and STB control API: Alexander has submitted a first try at a TV control interface which is based on the OIPF spec and builds on the HTML5 HTMLMediaElement interface that is used by the HTML5 <video> element. It adds support for video broadcasting represented in channels that can be switchend and changed while being shown in the <video> element. See tv.widl in "Task 166":http://79.125.104.127/redmine/issues/166.
    *Action for all to review this proposal before next meeting.*

-   Bar Code decoding library: Proposed solution is that the Camera API is used. A bar code decoding JavaScript library to process the image is created. The creation of such a library could be a task performed within WP5. Nick expessed concerns on accuracy and performance on such an approach and suggested a "state of the art" investigation to examine this issue. Andre stated that this is not needed. No conclusion.

Claes had to leave meeting.

*Action for all to review rest of list and provide comments by e-mail.*

Access to APIs on remote device
-------------------------------

**This is a very task for WP 3.2 as the ability to access resources on other devices is one of the core Webinos features.**

Anders has reviewed Andre’s input at: http://79.125.104.127/redmine/projects/t3-2/wiki/Access_to_APIs_on_remote_devices. See this wiki page and the mail thread on the subject "[webinos-wp3-ml] [webiinos wp3.2] Access to remote API’s/Discovery".
