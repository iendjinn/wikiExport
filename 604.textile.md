Scope of WP 3.2, phase 1
------------------------

We need to define the scope of WP 3.2, phase 1, i.e. which APIs should we include.

-   Referring to existing API specifications is the easy task
-   Crating new specifications requires resources

Nick: We need to consider the following

-   How difficult is the API implementation?
-   Which resources do we need and which are available?
-   Marketing considerations, we need to show that Webinos adds value and just not picks what already exists.

"Task 192 on Claes to Define which APIs that should be included in Webinos WP 3.2, phase 1":http://dev.webinos.org/redmine/issues/192

Process and tool for tangible specification work â€“ Nick
---------------------------------------------------------

Investigation done at this page: "Specification tools":http://dev.webinos.org/redmine/projects/wp3-1/wiki/Tools_%28for_specification_WIDLXML_creation%29

Nick suggests that Webinos uses Widlproc.

Some modifications needed:

-   Style sheet to give Webinos look and feel
-   Support for missing html tags
-   Support for latest webidl version

"Task 193 on Nick to Create a wiki pages with self-explanatory text on how to use widlproc tool for specification editing":http://dev.webinos.org/redmine/issues/193

(Note, Nick has already created this page: http://dev.webinos.org/redmine/projects/t3-2/wiki/IDL_Tool_Chain_instructions)

Async vs sync APIs
------------------

Nicks task http://dev.webinos.org/redmine/issues/184 ). See input from Nick: http://dev.webinos.org/redmine/projects/t3-2/wiki/Async_API_design

Nick walked through the information on this page but didn’t want to make a clear recommendation. More investigation needed. However, for those APIs that we create as asynchronous JavaScript APIs we need to make a sequential programming idiom possible (Claes question: Is this something we do when we design the APIs or in the code using the APIs?)

Guess we can base this on input from Daniel at http://dev.webinos.org/redmine/projects/wp3-1/wiki/Local_API_guidelines_%28in_preparation_for_32%29

"Task 194 on Daniel to Create an API styleguide for Webinos":http://dev.webinos.org/redmine/issues/194

Walk through open Tasks (http://dev.webinos.org/redmine/projects/t3-2/issues )
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

"Task 191 on Hans to Investigate route forward for NFC API":http://dev.webinos.org/redmine/issues/191: Decided that Hans will start to create an NFC API for the Tag R/W mode.

"Task 190 on Andre to state proposals for access to APIs on remote devices":http://dev.webinos.org/redmine/issues/190: Andre has updated the wiki. See http://dev.webinos.org/redmine/projects/t3-2/wiki/Access_to_APIs_on_remote_devices. Two proposals stated. **Action on all to review and provide feedback.**

"Task 189 on Alexander to Investigate rout forward for Bar Code API":http://dev.webinos.org/redmine/issues/189: Suggested that no specific API is created. Instead acquire the image data from the camera via camera API and pass it to an HTML5 canvas for example. From the canvas get the raw image data and pass it to a JavaScript library for barcode decoding and further handly the decoded barcode result. So the the task is not to create an API, but instead a JavaScript library for bar code decoding.

"Task 188 on Andre on Application Launcher for Widgets":http://dev.webinos.org/redmine/issues/188. Andre to provide input.

"Task 173 on Andre to conduct payment API investigation":http://dev.webinos.org/redmine/issues/173: The main question is if Webinos needs to specify a payment API or if an existing proprietary payment method API could be used. Nick stated that Webinos needs to create an API for this due to the need for a secure commercial eco-system. However, it is not clear if this tasks belongs to WP 3.2 or the security framework.

"Task 172 on Nick and Stefano to Investigate need for a specific Gallery API":http://dev.webinos.org/redmine/issues/172: Nick stated that a specific gallery API is needed as we need access optimize access to media and media meta data.

Nick suggested to start defining a Gallery API with Bondi gallery API as starting point. In addition the widlproc tool chain will be used as an example illustrating the use of this tool.

"Task 170 on Fraunhofer to investigate route forward for messaging API":http://dev.webinos.org/redmine/issues/170: Claes mentioned that there is a new version of the W3C DAP messaging API that use the existing URI schemes for sms, mms and e-mail as input. See "W3C DAP Messaging API":http://dev.w3.org/2009/dap/messaging/ and "Updated Messaging API draft":http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-device-apis/2011Apr/0028.html.

"Task 168 on Simon to investigate route forward for Vehicle API":http://dev.webinos.org/redmine/issues/168: Simon presented 3 options:
* OSGI
* Serial Line Automotive Protocol (SLAP)
* Embedded" web server for accessing car data.
Everyone to review and provide feedback.

"Task 166 on Dirk Thatmann to Provide input on TV and STB control API":http://dev.webinos.org/redmine/issues/166: Dirk presented 3 options:
* BBC REST API, simple
* OIPF, full featured but complex
* (missed this one..)

Dirk suggested a subset of OIPF.
