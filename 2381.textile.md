Forward chaining rule engine in JavaScript
==========================================

There are a number of existing rule engines written in Java, e.g. JESS, see:

-   "JESS Rule engine":http://www.jessrules.com/

However, there are very few for JavaScript. Some work has already been started by W3C/ERCIM on developing a forward chaining rule engine with a high level syntax that is parsed into JSON and compiled into a discrimination network for efficient execution. The hand written parser follows the approach first outlined by Vaughan Pratt in 1973, and uses top down recursive descent incorporating operator precedence. Each symbol is treated as an object that knows how to parse itself, and what output to construct. This approach generally yields better error reporting than automatically generated parsers.

The use of a discrimination network corresponds to the RETE algorithm, which trades increased memory usage for faster rule execution. The conditions for all rules are mapped into a directed acyclic graph, which minimizes the computational costs for determining which rules are applicable for any change of state. Each ‘fact’ is fed into the root of the graph. The nodes correspond to individual conditions. The changes in node state propagate to the leaves, where the rule conditions are attached. A conflict resolution mechanism picks which rule to execute when several are applicable.

The rule engine is intended for use as a **Node module**, but will also be usable as a library in the web page scripting environment.

Rule Syntax
-----------

The rule syntax currently looks like:

**if** condition **then** action, action, action;

where the condition is an operator expression over the current state, and each action updates the state. This approach can be readily extended to support the event-condition-action pattern by introducing a function predicate indicating an event.

**if** event(orientation) **and** condition **then** action, action, action;

Another possibility would be to state the event with a special syntax, e.g.

**on** orientation **if** condition **then** action, action, action;

If there are lots of rules, maintenance can be eased by creating modules for rules sharing the same condition. That condition is stated as a property of the named module. Such modules can be nested as required.

Rule Abstraction
----------------

Rules are easier to create and maintain if they can be written at different levels of abstraction so that they address different levels of concerns. High level rules set goals for lower level rules to address as they see fit.

Rule Primitives
---------------

This covers how the rule conditions and actions relate to the domain they operate over. For example, rules could operate over a declarative model of a user interface, that is represented as JSON. This is in turn related to the actual user interface in HTML via the model-view-controller design pattern. There needs to be a well defined set of rule primitives for conditions and actions. These primitives can be expressed as functions.

A related consideration is how information bound in conditions is coupled to actions. One solution is to support unification over named variables. This requires a syntax to identify such variables in conditions and actions, e.g. _$name_.

Client or Server Execution of Rules
-----------------------------------

In principle, the rule engine can be used locally or remotely to manage adaptation to the changing context. The choice depends on the nature of the context models and the sources of changes. The Personal Zone Hub could be in a better position to integrate disparate sources of context than an individual device and its Personal Zone Proxy. This also relates to the issue of how to manage context synchronization.

Rule interchange formats
------------------------

The if…then… syntax is convenient for direct editing, but where it comes to exporting or importing rules, it is useful to consider existing standards.

-   "W3C Rule Interchange Format (RIF) Production Rule Dialect":http://www.w3.org/2005/rules/wiki/PRD

-   "Common Logic Interchange Format (CLIF) as defined by ISO24707":http://standards.iso.org/ittf/PubliclyAvailableStandards/c039175_ISO_IEC_24707_2007%28E%29.zip

According to John Sowa, Common Logic is a framework for a family of logic-based languages, and as such provides a means for relating different dialects of logic, including controlled subsets of natural languages, see:

For production rules, RIF PRD is a much better target as it was specifically designed for this purpose. Moreover, the use of assignment in production rules makes them hard to express in pure logic.
