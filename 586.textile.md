Next WP3 Meeting
================

The Doodle poll for the meeting stood at seven votes for Munich, nine votes for Berlin and nine ‘no preference’ votes at the end of the voting period (after some post-deadline votes, current numbers are Munich:7, Berlin:10, NoPreference:11), so the WP3 meeting will be held from May 3rd to May 5th at Fraunhofer FOKUS in Berlin. We will plan for 2.5 meeting days, starting early on the 3rd and finishing after lunch / early afternoon on the 5th.

March effort WP3
================

Effort reporting had been spotty, so an Excel sheet was distributed with ‘planned/projected’ effort per partner/month/workarea for task 3.1 with request for immediate comment in case of significant changes, so that these could be addressed in the review if necessary (post-review note: none of the reviewers cared) and agreements or minor disagreements until April 8th.

Deadline: Monday, March, 28th.

Reports
=======

User ID / User data handling
----------------------------

DTAG hasn’t been able to provide resources so far, but will likely be able to provide from April onwards.

Analytics
---------

No updates here. This is still in some kind of limbo. Currently the relevant persons (Hans/Nick/George) are busy with review preparation. Needs to be resolved after the review.

Policy
Discovery
Web App
Privileged Apps
Event Handling
Browser Extensions
Context
-------------------

No specific updates on any of those. Work is continuing, no significant problems, but also no significant milestones or results reached.

Overlay Network
---------------

Has been skipped again due to Dave being not in the PhC. Will be taken up in April when Dave can contribute more time to webinos again.

AOB
---

Due to an internal event at Fraunhofer FOKUS, nobody from FOKUS will be able to attend the next phone call on April, 6. Nick will be asked to step in again.
