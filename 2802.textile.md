microPZP Use cases
==================

The following illustrative example use cases for a microPZP.

Portable navigation device
--------------------------

A single-purpose device, typically owned and operated by a single user, capable of supporting a limited set of remote services.
The APIs exported are:
* Geolocation;
* Route database : exposed as a filesystem, a set of files each with a set of waypoints;
* Recorded journey database : exposed as a filesystem, a set of files each with a set of waypoints and timestamps.

This is not a full PZP since there is not aspiration to be able to run user apps; but it is nonetheless a personal device with useful services that can be exposed in addition to simple geolocation; and the user will wish to have control over who can access those additional services.

As a mapping device with processor and memory resources commensurate with processing and displaying map data,, this device would be TLS-capable, operating over Wi-Fi or BT PAN. It exposes a REST configuration API in addition to the JSON-RPC API, and has a local admin web app with limited policy editing capability. A companion phone or PC application performs setup/enrolment through the admin API.

Multipurpose street furniture
-----------------------------

This would be a fixed device embedded in a permanent street fixture such as a street light. It contains a range of sensors for monitoring the ambient environment (power, light, temperature, accelerometer/wind, air quality), and also contains a remotely controllable camera.

The sensors are openly accessible for all webinos peer clients, but control of, and access to data from the camera is subject to permission and is only allowed from peer devices in the same Personal Zone.

A large, dynamic population of such installations operates using a mesh peer-to-peer network. This device is TLS-capable.

It exposes a REST configuration API in addition to the JSON-RPC API, and has a local admin web app with limited policy editing capability.

This could be architected as a set of sensors and actuators attached to a separate full PZP, but it is more appropriate for this to be a microPZP, given that it has multiple sensors that would be enrolled and configured as a single operation, and the device can communicate autonomously.

Industrial monitoring and control
---------------------------------

A range of devices exists in a large industrial facility. These are all small, low powered and specialized devices â€“ pollutant monitoring, temperatures, pressures, IR intrusion sensors, door and airlock controls, etc. Each device may expose a generic sensor API but could equally implement a specialized API for its specific purpose.

All devices communicate across the facility using a ZigBee mesh network and are not TLS-capable.

These devices could possibly be architected as individual sensors and actuators, but this is problematic because it requires the mediating PZP to have a local implementation of each API for every device. New devices that implemented new functionality would not be able to be added until there was a corresponding software update to the PZP to add awareness of the new API.

Architecting these devices instead as tethered microPZPs puts device-specific behavior into the device and the client apps, and avoids any device type-specific functionality in the proxy. As tethered devices there must be a proxy; the proxy is able to discover new devices on the mesh autonomously and can enrol those devices automatically as they come online.

The proxy exposes the admin interface for each device via an integrated REST service, which allows all devices to be controlled from anywhere within the facility.
