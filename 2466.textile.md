unshareTag
==========

This method is used after the shareTag method, and sets the device back to the default mode in which it listens for the presence of NFC tags.

<pre class="webidl prettyprint">
 // unset device from NDEF push sharing mode
 void unshareTag(SuccessCallBack success, FailCallBack fail);
</pre>

It makes use of the success and failure call back pattern. These call backs are defined in a subsequent section.
