General issues
--------------

### Progress and view on way of working - Claes

WP3.2 is making good progress. Lots of input on required APIs and on existing "candidate" APIs.
No comments on "way of working" so WP-leader assumes everything is just fine :-)

h3. Prototyping- Nick

API development scenarios:

1) We create something from scratch
2) We use an existing API as basis (e.g. WAC/W3C)

In both scenarios â€“ there is value in prototyping. There are two types of prototypes:

a) JavaScript stubs: which tests usability of API â€“ should be short 1-2 day effort max â€“ and is accounted for from 3.2 activity.
b) Real/Partial â€“ implementations_- must hook onto OS etc) which tests both usability and implementability â€“ significantly more effort â€“ to be accounted from 4.1 activity.

In 2 above â€“ once we had defined changes that need to be made â€“ then feedback to w3c etc â€“ is counted (partially) as 8.1 activity.

We should research auto-generating stubs from widls â€“ to help with a).

"Task 162 on TBD to investigate tool for auto-generating API stubs from widls":http://dev.webinos.org/redmine/issues/162.

### Standardization â€“ Claes, Nick

In addition to what is said above Claes stressed that it is important to provide input to W3C on things that we create in Webinos. This applies both to additions/modifications to existing W3C APIs and to completely new APIs. We also currently have the possibility to impact the scope of the W3C DAP WG as this WG now is in a rechartering process. "Proposed new DAP charter":http://www.w3.org/2010/11/DeviceAPICharter.html. Discussions on the charter could be followed through the "DAP Public mail archive":http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-device-apis/. If we for example discover that an API the is important for Webinos is not included in the charter we could argue for including it in the charter.

HW Resource APIs
----------------

### DeviceOrientation API - Claes

Claes proposed to choose the W3C DeviceOrientation Event. Stefano was not sure and promised to provide input on this matter.
"Task 163 on Stefano to provide input on selection of Device Orientation API":http://dev.webinos.org/redmine/issues/163

### Generic Sensor/Actuator API - Claes

This is a tricky beast. We need a generic/extensible sensor/actuator API in addition to discrete APIs, such as Geolocation and Deviceorintation, tailored to specific sensors.

Which approach should we take? Has a relation with device/service discovery.
Alternatives:
* Pure low level Bluetooth, ANT+, NFC, etc APIs? â€“ Flexible but complicated for developers and we need different APIs per bearer.
* Low level bearer independent â€socketâ€ API? â€“ Can hide bearer specific stuff
* Inspire from BLE GATT.
* Extensions to W3C System Information sensors API? â€“ Simple but limited
* APIs on top of Web Introducer ? â€“ Ok if we decide to go for the Web Introducer
* Pure REST APIs â€“ Can define interoperable discrete APIs accessing sensors/Actuators independently of where these are located. Hide REST layer by JS wrappers.

Existing sensor APIs from W3C, WAC and Symbian are rather similar in that they only support reading values and that addition of new sensor types require updates of the implementation of the API.

It was clarified that NFC should be in the scope for Webinos.

More investigation needed.

"Task 164 on Claes to investigate approach for a generic/extensible sensor/actuator API":http://dev.webinos.org/redmine/issues/164

### Microphone/Camera API - Stefano

The W3C Media Capture or W3C HTML Media Capture should be of for retrieving images and audio/video clips from camera and microphone. The W3C HTML Media Capture is currently is under implementation for Android 3.0. See http://developer.android.com/sdk/android-3.0.html. I guess that Google is also implementing this API for Chrome browser. Mozilla is experimenting but not sure if this is based on the W3C specification. See http://thetechjournal.com/internet/new-audio-and-video-recording-add-on-for-mozila-firefox.xhtml.

"Task 165 on Stefano to investigate W3C HTML Media Capture API versus W3C Media Capture API ":http://dev.webinos.org/redmine/issues/165

It was said that streaming could wait until Webinos phase 2 as the work within W3C Web-RTC WG just started.

### Geolocation API - Stefano

Webinos will use the W3C Geolocation as the specification is stable and it is deployed in all modern browsers.

### Devicestatus API - Stefano

W3C System Information might be best choice but there are currently discussions in W3C DAP on splitting this API into a set of discrete event based APIs for commonly accessed properties. See "Battery Status Event":http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-device-apis/2011Mar/0122.html for an example. We should follwo what DAP is doing here and provide input to based on Webinos requirements. If DAP is too slow we might have to base the Webinos API on something elese, e.g. the WAC API.

### TV and STB control API - Fraunhofer

"Task 166 on Dirk Thatmann to Provide input on TV and STB control API":http://dev.webinos.org/redmine/issues/166

### Deviceinteraction API - Stefano

The WAC Deviceinteraction module partly fulfills what we need. It is also interesting to look at Google Chrome APIs which makes it possible for web applications to interact with UI core functionality. Also note that the new "W3C DAP charter":http://www.w3.org/2010/11/DeviceAPICharter.html states that a new deliverable is â€œAn API to manage vibration, beeps, and menusâ€ so we have an opportunity to add value here by submitting results of our work to DAP.

"Task 167 on Stefano Vercelli to elaborate on DeviceInteraction API and investigate Google Chrome APIs to access UI functionality":http://dev.webinos.org/redmine/issues/167

### Vehicle API - Simon, Stefano

Here we need to decide whether we should specify a completely new tailored API or define this as a part of a generic API, e.g. an extension to WAC 2.0 devicestatus module or W3C System Information or part of a generic Sensor/Actuator API?

"Task 168 on Simon to investigate route forward for Vehicle API":http://dev.webinos.org/redmine/issues/168

### Bar code API - Hans

Hans was not in the meeting but he has provided input on an Android Java API, ZXing. Would it be an approach to make a web API based on this API?

"Task 169 on Hans to investigate rout forward for Bar Code API":http://dev.webinos.org/redmine/issues/169

Application Data APIs
---------------------

### Contacts and Calendar APIs - Fraunhofer

Currently we see no reasons for not choosing the W3C Contacts and Calendar APIs

### Messaging API- Fraunhofer

The simplest approach is of course to use the existing URI schemes. However, this is limited, e.g. only sending and attachments not supported.

"Task 170 on Fraunhofer (who?) to investigare route forward for messaging API":http://dev.webinos.org/redmine/issues/170

### Filesystem API â€“ Stefano

W3C APIs should be the main choice but Nick asked if there are any experiences in using them. Furthermore there were a question handling of binary data.

"Task 171 on Claes to check handling of binary data in W3C File APIs":http://dev.webinos.org/redmine/issues/171

### Multimedia/Gallery API- Fraunhofer

What do we need in addition to HTML5 video and audio elements? Do we need a specific Gallery API? Is it enough with File APis?
Nick stated that it is not enough with the File APIs. For example we need access to media metadata (there were also other issues but did not catch all of it)

"Task 172 on Nick and Stefano to Investigate need for a specific Gallery API":http://dev.webinos.org/redmine/issues/172

### Payment API â€“ Fraunhofer

"Task 173 on Andre to conduct payment API investigation":http://dev.webinos.org/redmine/issues/173

Communication APIs
------------------

Newly provided input so will be discussed at the next meeting.

Application Execution APIs
--------------------------

### Applauncher APIâ€“ Fraunhofer

We need to clarify which requirements we have here. Mozilla Open Web Apps JS API might be the best option.
Status in W3C on Application Launcher API is unknown.

"Task 174 on Claes to Investigate status for Application Launcher API in W3C":http://dev.webinos.org/redmine/issues/174

Service Discovery APIs
----------------------

Samsung has provided a set of API proposals. As these API relate to the architecture for Service, Application and Device discovery it is suggested that at this initial stage these APIs are discussed as part of the WP3.1 Discovery task.

### Security and Privacy APIs

Oxford has provided Aims for Security and Privacy APIs. Suggest that this is first discussed as part of WP3.5.

"Task 175 on Stefan Andersson/SEMC to review Aims for Security and Privacy APIs":http://dev.webinos.org/redmine/issues/175
