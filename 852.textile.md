31 Deliverable Background Privileged Apps
=========================================

Background
----------

Introduction:
-------------

**Scope**:

The scope of this section is to provide Access Control or Privileged Apps and Services specifications. The objective of this section is to recommend a security solution for implementation using the Privileged Apps and Services concept in webinos project. The use of the concept of Privileged Apps and Services is an important factor in webinos. A webinos application will be signed with a certificate that is in the privileged certificate store on the device. Target an application based on its Digital Certificate and there shall be policies assigned to these applications.

Privileged applications are those apps that request additional capabilities, e.g. access to a location or to restricted data such as your contacts, vehicle engine details. Although these kinds of applications also require access to special APIs like an automotive or home media app and the access to these APIs has to be granted by administrator or a privileged user, these applications shall focus on the management of the webinos runtime.

A privilege management creates, stores, and manages the attributes and policies needed to establish criteria that can be used to decide whether a userâ€™s request for access to some resource should be granted. Access control uses the data made available by authentication, privilege management, and other information provided by the access request provider, such as the form of access requested to make an access control decision.

The design principles for the privileged architecture in this section are:

1.) Guarding against threats that access critical data.
2.) Establishing levels of security for data and other resources by using Policies.
3.) Implement dashboard, installer, launcher, and policy manager.
4.) Allow direct control over API access by the API provider. E.g., a car manufacturer can write engine monitoring APIs and allow them to access only via the car manufacturer signed applications. Let there be a signed certificate, Identity and Integrity checks for widget based Apps. Protection and Security from hacks at the runtime and accessing sensitive API’s. To support these Cryptographic methods, Encryption code be used. The Apps are signed and confirmed by the Device Manufacturer when using Sensitive API’s and Critical data, the Monitoring system checks and manages that there is no access to critical data like Engine Diagnose API’s and HW data.
5.) The Privileged Apps and Services shall provide information related to Date, Event ID, Event Description, Username, Parent PID, Policy, Application Group, Reason, Custom Token, Filename/Codebase, Type, Instances, Description, and Certificate.

Two ways of using Privileged Apps and Services in webinos for security purpose:
1.) Enforce access control policies at the Runtime Environment.
2.) An Application which uses system commands and classes which manages the OS services, access rights, registries, roles based on the users and so on.

Privileged Application in JavaScript and provide a recommendation, which solution shall be incorporated into the webinos runtime.

The working of XACML with Privilege Apps and Services (Access Control):
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

The deployment of the XACML access control system SHALL work:

â€¢ A User seeks access to some resource and submits a query to the entity (Policy Enforcement Point (PEP)) protecting the resource.
â€¢ The PEP forms a request (using the XACML request language) based on the attributes of the subject, action, resource, and other relevant information.
â€¢ The PEP then sends this request to a Policy Decision Point (PDP) that examines the request, retrieves policies (written in the XACML policy language) that are applicable to this request, and determines whether access should be granted according to the XACML rules for evaluating policies.
â€¢ The answer (expressed in the XACML response language) is returned to the PEP, which can then allow or deny access to the requester.

**Policy Language and Enforcement**

-   The implementation of a policy system requires to choose algorithms for reconciling conflicting policies. It should independently administer multiple policies controlling access to the same resources.
-   An efficient way of locating all the policies that are potentially applicable to a given decision.

Scope of Privilege Apps in different areas in webinos:
------------------------------------------------------

**Authentication and Authorization**:

-   Grant security properties, like authorization and access control like what resources the user can access.
-   The logging of the Authentication to the personal zone (user authentication with the personal zone hub). The Notification and keeping track of the Personal zone identity and personal zone proxies.
-   Running retrieve data in privilege app space.
-   Updating user credential information such as password, certificates.
-   Enable access to recorded decisions when the user isn’t available in real time.

**Authorization and Privilege**:

-   common authorization model for all the trust domains.
-   Common language for expressing security policies.
-   Support of authorizations at all levels of granularity.
-   Storing Authorization in a safe and protected place if they are not digitally signed
-   Identify applications which have been granted particular privileges.
-   List of all their webinos applications for the users.
-   Restrictions of the access control policies on applications from potentially malicious applications.
-   Ensuring that only trusted components are downloaded
-   Delegate decisions to a trusted third party when appropriate.

**Discovery**:

-   The access control should check whether the address, devices or services are valid or not.
-   If service driver is required to be installed for the device, privilege application should support the driver.
-   Device visibility control, device in multicast mode could be passive or active listener.
-   Access control to access different file system area and obtain user credentials information.
-   Specify a access format.

**Context**:

-   Defining Policies to access his (photo, photo-album, a playlist) and other stuffs across other webinos devices.
-   Grant and retrieve the data and the Policies based on Context.
-   Storing of device context in file system.
-   Review and manage which applications users have granted permissions to, and in what context.
-   Policies based on Subjects and Resources

Phase 2: Tasks in the scope of Privilege Apps and Services:
-----------------------------------------------------------

The PZP can handle many devices and multiple Users So there should be certain level of Permissions enforced to on a particular user for viewing, editing files, modifying system files. Similarly, there may be certain web apps which would try to access the restricted registry files, drivers or at the kernel level.

So the Owner of the Device can permit privileges can delete files, view private information, or install unwanted programs.

**Most Privileged**:
when the user or process is able to obtain a higher level of access than an administrator or system developer intended, possibly by performing kernel-level operations

â€¢ An attacker may then be able to exploit this assumption so that unauthorized code is run with the application’s privileges.

â€¢ Some services are configured to run under the Local System user account. A vulnerability such as buffer overflow may be used to execute
 arbitrary code with privilege elevated to local system.

â€¢ Any User which accesses binary in the file system or Registry can therefore elevate privileges.

â€¢ core dump be performed in case it crashes and then have itself killed by another process.

â€¢ Cross Zone Scripts should be identified so that the running of the malicious code on the client side can be prevented.

**Least Privileged**:

Least Privileged: An application allows to gain access to resources that normally would have been protected from an application or user. The application would perform actions but different security context than intended by the application developer or Administrator.

**RBAC - Role Based Access Control**:

RBAC is an approach to restricting system access to authorized users. The permissions to perform certain operations are assigned to specific roles. The webinos shall provide a RBAC model where the Privileged Users are assigned particular roles, and through these role assignments acquire the permissions to perform particular system functions. Since users are not assigned permissions directly, but only acquire them through their role (or roles), management of individual user rights becomes a matter of simply assigning appropriate roles to the user; this simplifies common operations, such as adding a user devices, or changing a user’s role.

Three primary rules are defined for RBAC:
1. Role assignment: A subject can execute a transaction only if the subject has selected or been assigned a role.
2. Role authorization: A subject’s active role must be authorized for the subject. This rule ensures that users can take on only roles for which they are authorized.
3. Transaction authorization: A subject can execute a transaction only if the transaction is authorized for the subject’s active role. With rules 1 and 2, this rule ensures that users can execute only transactions for which they are authorized.

**Areas to Consider**:

-   If a subject has roles R1 , R2, … Rn enabled, can subject X access a given resource using a given action?
-   Is subject X allowed to have role Ri enabled?
-   If a subject has roles R1 , R2, … Rn enabled, does that mean the subject will have permissions associated with a given role R’? That is, is role R’ either equal to or junior to any of
     roles R1 , R2, â€¦Rn?

**Access Control Matrix**

It would be important for webinos to include the Access Control Matrix it is a useful model for understanding the behavior and properties of access control systems. This matrix defines the trust relationships between the control domains and sub-domains. The implementation of the access control matrix can be based on a combination of Access Control Lists, permission files, and an enforcement engine, such as Javaâ€™s Security Manager and Access Controller. Policies are based on the relationships defined in the Access Control Matrix.

Types of accesses that are necessary to define the relationships between the objects and subjects in webinos.

1.  File Access, which includes the following permissions: Read, Write, and Execute.
2.  Message Access, which is necessary because of the need to control the exchange of messages between trusted and non-trusted domains and subjects. Message Access includes the following permissions: Send and Receive.
3.  Process Access, which controls the start and termination of processes such as Core Software Download, including the following permissions: Initiate, and Terminate.
4.  Key Accesses. This access type includes Create and Use

Examples showing the Policy Enforcement Point in Mobile Platform and in the High Level Vehicle Bus Infrastructure:
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Policy Enforcement Point in Mobile Platform:

![](mobile_accesscontrol1.jpg)

The security features and the policies supported by the Mobile device are enabled or enforced in the Policies and Privilege services layer which extends Javaâ€™s ‘SecurityManager’ and ‘AccessController’ classes. At runtime, the Policies and Privilege services layer decides what policies are to be enforced and what privileges can be applied when a connection request is made. Based on the domain, device, device type and whether the domain or device is trusted or un-trusted, the Privilege layer can enforce application level authentication, encryption of the session and any other specific access policies. For the Information regarding the services that the decision is to be are available in the manifested files and are described in hash of Policy files that are stored securely.

The Privilege services layer provides security services:

â€¢ The Privilege Monitor stores event logs in its registers for auditing purposes.
â€¢ The Privilege Apps and services will provide cryptographic services, to include asymmetric key generation, digital signatures, hashing, and encryption.
â€¢ The key used during access control can be securely stored using the Certificate storeâ€™s Secure Key Storage capabilities.
â€¢ The runtime Privilege Apps auditing functions will make full use of the registers, Secure Data Storage, and Session Storage capabilities.

### Example for Policy Enforcement Point in High Level Vehicle Bus Infrastructure for IVI:

![](pa2.jpg)

This example illustrates the Policy Enforcement Point in a High Level Vehicle Bus Infrastructure. The in-car headunit is basically an in-car PC connected to the infotainment bus. All infotainment relevant control units such as the cd changer, telephone, gps module are connected to this bus and can communicate with each other on this bus by sending messages. At BMW MOST driver is being used as the infotainment bus (for more information on MOST Bus see this link: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MOST_Bus. This infotainment bus is connected to the Common Gateway (CGW). To this central gateway all other vehicle buses (e.g., High speed CAN or comfort CAN) are connected as well. At the CGW some messages from the â€˜Comfort-CANâ€™ and â€˜High Speed CANâ€™ (e.g., speed, wiper status, climate) are converted to MOST messages and routed into the MOST bus.

The MOST bus transports control data as well as data from audio, video, navigation and other services. MOST technology provides a logical framework model for control of the variety and complexity of data. The MOST Application Framework organizes the functions of the overall system. MOST is able to control and dynamically manage functions that are distributed in the vehicle.

There are two places to enforce the access to the vehicle data. We can place the enforcement point inside the webinos runtime: When an app calls a specific vehicle function, the runtime checks back with a PDP, if the access is allowed or not. If allowed, the request is pushed to the OS service to create a MOST message and put it onto the bus. At the OS service (before we built the MOST message for this request) we could also check back with the PDP, if the access is allowed or not.
