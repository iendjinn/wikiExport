Messaging and routing
=====================

{{toc}}

Scope:

Webinos messaging and routing specifies interfaces for message creating and routing in webinos system. These interfaces shall be generic enough to be used from both webinos core and application levels.

1. Introduction
---------------

Webinos messaging and routing defines interfaces to create, address, route and handle messages among addressable entities and network interfaces in webinos system. The interfaces are specified in a very generic fashion in a sense that there is no need to have knowledge of the specific messaging protocols being used under. The operations of routing, however, rely on the interconnect technology abstraction and NAT traversal capabilities provided by the overlay networking system (see [[Architecture_Overview#2]]) to enable easy and consistent communication with the external networks.

The interfaces support both Point-to-Point (PTP) and Publish/Subscribe (Pub/Sub) messaging models. Due to the significant differences between these two models, methods of handling are specified separately where required.

This specification describes the interfaces from the following aspects:

-   Message object
-   Message routing

The interfaces specified will be used by webinos core entities, e.g. Personal Zone Hubs (PZHs) and Personal Zone Proxies (PZPs), and applications. A set of JavaScript inter-application messaging APIs wrapped from these interfaces are exposed to applications to allow them to send or forward messages to other entities, whether local or remote, and to receive messages addressed to themselves or to the addressable entities they control (e.g., a service created by the application) in a seamless way. Details on JavaScript APIs can be found in section 3. It is followed by discussions of dependencies on other components in webinos system.

2. Technical Formal Specification
---------------------------------

### 2.1 PZH Address Resolving

When a connection needs to be established to a PZH the connecting entity (PZH, PZP) only has an OpenID user identity to start with. As outlined in [[Entity Definitions]] the receiving PZH is expected to be part of a different internet domain quite often. Still, the user identity must be resolved to the PZH URI that in its turn can be addressed using regular DNS A of AAAA record lookup.

Resolving an OpenID user identity to a PZH URI SHALL be done by following these steps, in the given order:
1. OpenID attribute exchange method, specified at http://openid.org with attribute ‘webinos-pzh’
2.

As soon as one step succeeds, the resolving party MUST NOT try following steps.

In the following sections the steps are outlined in more detail.

#### 2.1.1 OpenID attribute exchange

An OpenID may optionally contain attributes. If it does contain an attribute named ‘webinos-pzh’ it SHALL contain a full URI to the PZH.

#### 2.1.2 DNS NAPTR

When a user has DNS control over the internet domain to which his OpenID identifier belongs he can use DNS NAPTR [RFC2915]. This can be used to resolve the PZH address. The NAPTR allows a rewrite of the user identifier to the PZH address using DNS. An example NAPTR for webinos would look like this:

someprovider.com.
 IN NAPTR 100 10 "U" "http+I2L" "!(.*)@(.*)![](https://2/1)".

The rewrite regexp is simplified for readability (e.g., it does not do rigorous validation of the identifier). In the example an OpenID identifier from someprovider.com (e.g., fred@someprovider.com) is rewritten to the PZH address http://someprovider.com/fred. If the domain part of the PZH is different, the rewrite rule would change to e.g.:

someprovider.com.
 IN NAPTR 100 10 "U" "http+I2L" "!(.*)@(.*)![](https://otherprovider.com/1)".

Bear in mind that this last setup may reguire changes to a domains DNS records when doing user administration.

The "U" flag indicates that the next step is not a (direct) DNS lookup. The "http+I2L" service field indicates that the protocol to be used for the result is HTTP and the URI resolves to a URL [RFC2483].

When DNS NAPTR is user for resolving OpenID URIs, the record SHALL contain a "http+I2L" service field. If user@domain OpenID identifiers are resolved, the service field record SHALL contain "http+I2L". In addition, DNS NAPTR used for webinos purposes SHALL be compliant.

#### 2.1.3 WebFinger

For users that have no administrative DNS-level access to their domain but do control the entire website space of their OpenID-referenced domain, WebFinger (http://webfinger.org) might be an option. It is enabled by adding a `http://example.com/.well-known/host-meta` file to the website, that defines a template on how to find the webfinger information for a user. This user specific information could then contain a webinos link like so:

<Link rel=`http://webinos.org/spec/1.0’
ref=`http://phz.example.org/profile/joe.smith’/>

When WebFinger support is chosen, a link statement SHALL be used where the rel value equals `http://webinos.org/spec/1.0` and where the ref value contains the full URI to the users’ PZH.

#### 2.1.4 webinos.org central lookup

While the webinos project is running, a WebFinger service will be maintained on `webfinger.webinos.org`.

If all else fails and the `webfinger.webinos.org` domain has an A and/or AAAA record of its own, `webfinger.webinos.org` MAY be used for resolving PZHs. If `webfinger.webinos.org` does not have an A or AAAA record, callers MUST refrain from calling the default http server.

### 2.2 Routing

At a conceptual level, the webinos routing system SHALL provide a complete end-to-end routing path between service/application instances as shown in the following diagram, either within a personal zone or cross personal zones.

![](end_end_routing.png)

It is required that

-   Each entity involved in the routing is addressable, either via a name or address.
-   Each entity is able to establish communication session(s) or channel(s) with its routing neighbour(s).

At implementation level, Webinos core components, PZPs and PZHs, SHALL have routing manager functionality for creating and maintaining routing table, checking and dispatching messages.

#### 2.2.1 Routing Models

Message propagation and routing in Webinos are performed in one of two ways:

-   Point-to-point routing. The sending application explicitly specifies the destination to which it is sending the message. There is a relatively tight coupling between the sending application or process and the receiving party.

![](http://dev.webinos.org/redmine/attachments/2346/point-to-point.png)

-   Publish-subscribe routing. The sending application does not know the destination to which it is sending the message, but instead assigns the responsibility for managing who receives the message to the middleware. The middleware defines a list of topics on which the message creator publishes messages. In contrast to a point-to-point communication, in a publish/subscribe model, a copy of the message is processed for each of the logical subscriptions.

#### 2.2.2 Addressing / Entity Naming for Messaging

The addressing and entity naming for messaging are inspired by the "Entity Naming for Messaging discussions in WP4":http://dev.webinos.org/redmine/projects/wp4/wiki/Entity_Naming_for_Messaging.

##### Entities overview

The following entities need a name so they can be addressed:

![](entities.png)

and they are ordered as depicted in the following figure:

![](entity-order.png)

##### Names

User Identities take the form
<pre>
user@domain.ext
</pre>

PZPs have, globally unique, friendly names:
<pre>
laptop
mobile
</pre>
which are provisioned when webinos is first installed on a certain device.

Where possible, we use Uniform Resource Names (URNs) constructed according to "RFC 2141":https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2141.

For services, this would be:
<pre>
urn:services-webinos-org:calender
urn:services-webinos-org:geolocation
</pre>

At a later stage, third parties may of course extend webinos and add services from other name spaces.

Service Instances receive an automatically generated name, like
<pre>
A0B3
</pre>
which need to be unique within the scope of the PZP they are running in. PZHs are informed of all running services on all connected PZPs.

A Service Instance is addressed by a combination of the service URN and the automatically generated name. This way it is human readable to which kind of service a message is being sent. The URN is also used by service discovery to identify the service type of a service that is discovered.

##### Messaging

The interface between the PZP and the PZH is aggressive up, meaning as soon as the PZP has network connectivity it will try to connect to the PZH.

To send a message to a service from somebody else the complete name is constructed like so:
<pre>
other_user@her_domain.com <— name of user identity (PZH?)
 |
 *— laptop <— name of the PZP
 |
*— urn:services-webinos-org:calender <— service type
 |
 +— A0B3 <— service implementation
</pre>

##### Sessions

As soon as an application or a service binds to another service, they implicitly create a session, to which they receive a reference. The session object stores all names (plus the resolved addresses) so the callers do not have to do that themselves. Replying to a message is simply done through the session.

#### 2.2.3 Routing Algorithm

##### Message validation

The message metadata shall be checked at both sender/publisher and receiver/subscriber sides to ensure validity, well-formedness and consistency.

Message validation failure MAY result in automatic generation and sending of delivery notification messages by the checking party if it’s not the message source and the message requires delivery notification. This kind of behaviour, however, is implementation-defined. Failure to validate a message SHALL prevent the message from being further processed.

Errors during the validation phase when the message source is local SHALL, instead, result in appropriate exceptions being thrown at the application-level.

##### Route Determination

The route determination decides how each recipient is to be reached. In the route determination phase the routing manager SHALL check the recipient and determine whether it is local or remote. In the former case, it SHALL ensure that the recipient actually exists and is reachable upon policy restrictions and, if this condition does not hold true, it SHOULD automatically generate and send a delivery notification message to inform the message source. In the latter case it SHALL determine whether the recipient is reachable within the local networks the device is connected to or not, and also which network interface is going to be used to reach the recipient, so that this information is available in the policy enforcement phase.

Route determination for messages SHALL be performed once per recipient, so that individual failures SHALL only affect one message/recipient combination. Failures during the route determination phase SHALL prevent the message from being further processed for that message/recipient combination.

##### Application-level routing

The message handling functionality exposed to the application, at the lowest level, consists of a restricted set of conceptually simple operations: generating and sending messages, or forwarding them, and registering listeners for incoming messages.

This implies that the message routing manager SHALL be able to somehow create the JavaScript representations of incoming message objects and to properly trigger the execution of the relevant listener callbacks.

Each application SHALL be allowed to handle messages from/to addressable entities that it "owns" (e.g., the application itself, the services it exposes), obviously according to the constraints imposed by local policy rules and authorizations, hence it SHALL be able to both receive messages directed to any addressable entity that it owns and to send/forward message on the behalf of any addressable entity it owns.

Other than that, at this level, the behaviour of the system is highly dependent on the actual webinos inter-application messaging API specification, hence that document is to be considered the reference for determining whether a given implementation is in conformance or not.

##### Network-level routing

The network-level routing algorithm SHALL be based on the defined addressing scheme.

Each routing entity SHALL register itself with its parent node and child node if the other parties have not registered themselves with this routing entity. A successful registration process SHALL result in an entry or record in local routing table for both parties that registering and being registered with.

On receiving a message, the receiver checks if itself is the message destination. If so, based on the message type, correspondent handler functions/callbacks MAY be called. For example, if a JSON RPC type of message is received, the following procedure May happen:
* Message destination calls rpchandler to handle the message.
* RPC result is packed within a new message object. Return route back to message origin follows the same routing rule as any message experienced.
* When RPC result is received by the message origin, if a callback was defined during creating message, this callback will be executed.

In the case that the message receiver is not the final destination, the receiver SHALL forward the message. When there is no routing information about the final destination available at this message receiver, it SHALL look up the routing table for the next available hop to the destination.

### 2.3 Message Object

#### 2.3.1 Generic Message Object

Each message results in the creation of a message object. A generic message object is defined here. Any user or system specified message object will be a subclass of the generic message object. The generic message object includes the following attributes:

  ----------------- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ --------------- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  **Attribute**     **Description**                                                                                                                **Mandatory**   **Data type**
  type              Identifies the message type and determines payload semantics                                                                   Yes             String that matches the following regular expression: [_a-zA-Z][_a-zA-Z0-9]*
  from              Represents the entity that originally sent the message                                                                         Yes             Addressable entity object reference
  to                destination entity                                                                                                             Yes             addressable entity object reference
  id                Message identifier                                                                                                             Yes             String identifying the message
  timestamp         Moment in time in which the message is generated by the original message source                                                No              A suitable date/time representation with millisecond precision or better
  expires           Moment in time past which the message is no more valid or meaningful                                                           No              A suitable date/time representation with millisecond precision or better
  deliveryReceipt   Indicates whether the sending entity wants to be notified by the receiving entities about the result of the message delivery   No              Boolean value
  payload           Message type-specific data                                                                                                     No              String
  ----------------- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ --------------- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This specification does not demand the usage of a specific serialization for transmitting messages, yet it presupposes that:
* the actual serialization has a one-to-one mapping with Unicode code points for addresses and payload data;
* a one-to-one mapping between addressable entities and address strings is defined.

The ‘id’ attribute is used by the sender to track if a response or error message that it might receive is in relation to that message.

It is up to the sender of the message whether the value of the ‘id’ attribute is unique only within the current session or is globally unique.

#### 2.3.2 Delivery Notification Message object

The delivery notification protocol is part of the core webinos message handling protocol and it provides a handful of ICMP-like functionality to the system.

A delivery notification message SHOULD be generated when an entity receives or is about to receive an message having the "deliveryReceipt" attribute specified as true. The notification message MAY be generated at the destination of message delivery or at the router on the path when there is issue to pass the message on, e.g. message validation fails or the router couldn’t find next hop to deliver the message.

The Delivery notification message object is a subclass of generic message object. In order for a delivery notification message to be considered valid, the following attributes MUST be set as hereby described:

  ----------------- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  **Attribute**     **Valid values**
  type              "deliveryNotification"
  to                The "to" MUST be the entity that this notification was generated or, if none, the entity is specified by the Source attribute
  id                Reference to the message because of which this notification was generated
  deliveryReceipt   false
  payload           String
  ----------------- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Payload attribute MUST be specified as one of the following values:

  -------------------- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  **Value**            **Meaning**
  "ok"               Message successfully delivered
  "duplicate"        A message with the same ID was already delivered to the recipient
  "invalid"          The recipient got an invalid message (e.g., transmission error)
  "badDestination"   The intended recipient is unknown or unreachable
  "expired"          The message expired before the actual delivery, according to its "Expiry timestamp" attribute
  "refused"          The message could not be received because of lack of authorization and/or policy settings
  "noReference"      The recipient does not hold a local reference to the message specified by the "In response to" attribute
  -------------------- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

#### 2.3.3 RPC Message Object

The RPC Message Object message object is also a subclass of generic message object. It basically wraps
[[Messaging_and_Routing#51-JSONRPC2.0|JSONRPC2.0]] objects and batches into webinos messages, hence concepts, terminology, payload syntax and semantics, and behaviour are meant to be aligned with that specification.

A JSON-RPC 2.0 request object or request batch is wrapped into a webinos RPC request message that, in order to be considered valid, MUST have the following attributes set as hereby described:

  --------------- ----------------------------------------------
  **Attribute**   **Valid values**
  type            "JSONRPC20Request"
  id              Identity of the RPC request message
  payload         JSON-RPC 2.0 request object or request batch
  --------------- ----------------------------------------------

When an entity offering RPC interfaces receives an RPC request message that does not contain a notification or a notification-only batch and said entity is a primary recipient of that message, it SHOULD generate and send an RPC response message, possibly according to specific policy rules.

Similarly to webinos RPC request messages, a JSON-RPC 2.0 response object or response batch is wrapped into a webinos RPC response message that, in order to be considered valid, MUST have the following attributes set as hereby described:

  --------------- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  **Attribute**   **Valid values**
  type            "JSONRPC20Response"
  to              The "to" set MUST contain only a reference to the entity specified by the "to" attribute in the RPC request message because of which this RPC response message was generated
  id              Reference to the RPC request message because of which this RPC response message was generated
  payload         JSON-RPC 2.0 response object or response batch
  --------------- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Note**: the JSON-RPC 2.0 specification states that notifications MUST NOT be replied to, and the same holds true for this specification; nevertheless it is still possible to use the "deliveryReceipt" attribute to be informed about the delivery of an RPC request message, even if it contains a notification or a notification-only batch.

This protocol is meant to be automatically handled by the WRT without requiring any extra effort on the developer side: the message Handling API and the routing manager SHALL prevent applications from creating and receiving messages whose type is "JSONRPC20Request" or "JSONRPC20Response", while it SHALL be possible to expose RPC interfaces by describing them in the config.xml file, as specified in the Foundations section of this specification, and the WRT SHALL automatically create functions with corresponding names into the local JavaScript object that represents a discovered service, mapping calls to those functions to asynchronous RPC requests and responses operated via this protocol.

#### 2.3.4 PROP Message Object

PROP message type is created by webinos for TLS session set-up and communications between webinos core components. It MUST have the following attributes set as hereby described:

  --------------- -------------------------------
  **Attribute**   **Valid values**
  type            "Prop"
  to              destination entity
  id              Reference to the Prop message
  payload         Prop message body
  --------------- -------------------------------

3. JavaScript APIs
------------------

The message handling functionality SHALL be available to application and third-party developers through the webinos App2App Messaging API.

See the API specification for further details: http://dev.webinos.org/specifications/new/app2app.html

4. Dependencies on other components
-----------------------------------

### 4.1 Policy Enforcement

policy enforcement, to ensure that local policy settings allow for the message to be further processed;
Policy enforcement of messages coming from remote sources SHALL be performed once per local recipient, so that individual failures SHALL only affect one message/recipient combination. Failures during the policy enforcement phase SHALL prevent the message from being further processed for that message/recipient combination.

Local policy rules are also implementation-defined, hence not described in this specification. Again, if the local policy prevents the message from being delivered and the message source (forwarding source, or, if none, original source) does not reside on the device and the message has the "Delivery notification wanted" attribute specified as true, a "refused" delivery notification message SHOULD be automatically generated by the WRT and sent back to the source.
