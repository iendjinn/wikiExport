_**How to determine when it is reasonable to exit sharing mode? Is there a way to determine that the other device has moved out of range? Or perhaps an acknowledgement that it read the shared data?**_

You can set your NFC device, e.g. a smart phone to push an NDEF message to another such device. The first step is to prepare the message. You then call the shareTag method to enter the sharing mode:

<pre class="javascript prettyprint">
// called when the Tag is discovered
function listener (event)
{
 var nfc = Webinos.nfc;

// prepare an NDEF message
 var message = [
 nfc.uriRecord("http://www.example.com/");
 ];

// and write it back to the Tag
 nfc.shareTag(message, success, fail);
}

function success ()
{
 console.log("entered NFC sharing mode");
}

function fail ()
{
 console.log("failed to enter NFC sharing mode");
}
</pre>

Some time later, you call the unshareTag method to restore your device to normal mode of operation where it is listening for NFC Tags that come in range:

<pre class="javascript prettyprint">
 nfc.unshareTag(success, fail);

â€¦

function success ()
{
 console.log("exited NFC sharing mode");
}

function fail ()
{
 console.log("error on exiting NFC sharing mode");
}
</pre>
