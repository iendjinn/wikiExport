PZP Enrolment Proposal: Browser Automated Enrolment
===================================================

Introduction
------------

The problem with PZP enrolment, at present, is that it is difficult and counter intuitive. Visiting a webpage and then copying a short code is tedious and a high barrier to entry.

This proposal outlines an alternative which involve minimal user interaction, beyond installing the PZP and authenticating.

Scenario 1
----------

_We assume that the user has installed a PZP and has a PZH already._

Alice has bought a new tablet PC. She installs the PZP and then browses to her PZH web interface (http://pzh.samsung.com/alice). After logging in, she clicks ‘add this device’. This sends a message to the currently-virgin PZP containing an authentication code and the URL of the PZH. The PZP then asks Alice "pzh.samsung.com claims to be your personal zone hub. Would you like to join this personal zone?" She clicks ‘yes’ and the PZP then creates the connection, enrolling the device.

**Details**

1.  The PZH should use webinos.js to connect to the PZP. The PZH ‘add device’ page is effectively a webinos application.
2.  webinos.js should offer a method such as "enrolDevice(authcode, userid)". This is not a public API, and should only be enabled when the PZP is not part of a zone
3.  The PZP should come pre-configured with a whitelist of known PZHs such as "pzh.samsug.com". This can be turned off, but prevents arbitrary websites from claiming to be your PZH. All entries on the whitelist must be accessed over HTTPS.
4.  The PZP should reject any "enrolDevice" messages coming from a non-https domain.

Scenario 2
----------

_We do not assume that Alice has a PZH already_

Alice has bought a new tablet PC. She installs the PZP and it loads up a browser, asking her to select a PZH provider from a pre-defined list. It then sends her to this provider’s landing page. The PZH provider asks whether she has an account already - if so, it sends her to the "add this device" page. If not, it send her to the "new customer" page. From this point onward, the same flow is followed as before. However, the PZP now knows in advance which domains are allowed to request her PZP to join the personal zone. The PZP should not allow any other PZHFarms to attempt to enrol, and should still insist on the enrolment happening over a secure connection.
