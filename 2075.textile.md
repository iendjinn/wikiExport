Resource overview.
------------------

Action for all partners to fill in the wiki table under "Resources":http://dev.webinos.org/redmine/projects/t3-4/wiki#Resources with estimated effort in PM and workarea. Still missing input from Antenna, Deutsche Telecom, Ercim, IBBT, Impleo, Polito, Samsung, TIS, TNO, TUB, UniCT, VisionMobile.

Update all task 3.2 APIs according to latest W3C widl-specification.
--------------------------------------------------------------------

-   See http://dev.webinos.org/redmine/projects/t3-4/wiki/API_specification_update_due_to_new_W3C_widlspecification.

-   Need feedback from Dom and from Paddy. Claes to check status.

Task 3.2 APIs to remove
-----------------------

-   See http://dev.webinos.org/redmine/projects/t3-4/wiki/Task_32_APIs_to_remove

-   Currently only Media Capture APi stated as â€œnot neededâ€ as it will be replaced by getUserMedia.

-   Question raised on the W3C Gallery API that we refer. W3C has "shelved" this API, i.e. it is not any longer worked on. "Action on Claes to initiate a discussion on Gallery API as W3C has "shelved" this API":http://dev.webinos.org/redmine/issues/871

API specification alignment with task 4.1 API implementations
-------------------------------------------------------------

-   See http://dev.webinos.org/redmine/projects/t3-4/wiki/API_specification_alignment_with_task_41_API_implementations

-   We need input here. Each API must have an owner/editor that is responsible for keeping the API up to date with our implementation! Please provide feedback at this wiki page!

New proposed APIs
-----------------

-   See http://dev.webinos.org/redmine/projects/t3-4/wiki/New_proposed_Webinos_APIs

-   Bluetooth API: Ziran has entered information on this API at the wiki page. We had a discussion on if we should provide such a low level API as a Bluetooth API to the developers. A more developer friendly solution would be to add new sensor types to the Sensor API, e.g. "Pulse meter" and leave the low level communication stuff, i.e. Bluetooth in this case, to the implementation of the Sensor API in the PZP. The reason that this low level API was used for the pulse meter MWC demo was probably that there were not time to integrate a pulse meter sensor in the Sensor API. "Action on Claes to discuss with Ziran on adding Pulse meter (and more sensor types?) to the Sensor API":http://dev.webinos.org/redmine/issues/872

-   getUserMedia: "Action on Martin and Anders to provide information":http://dev.webinos.org/redmine/issues/868

-   oAuth API: Paolo has updated the wiki page with a brief description of the oAuth api. Here is the link: http://dev.webinos.org/redmine/projects/t3-4/wiki/New_proposed_Webinos_APIs#oAuth-API. The task of specifying an oAuth API involves both task 3.3 and 3.4.

Aligning Webinos APIs with latest W3C and other standards
---------------------------------------------------------

-   See http://dev.webinos.org/redmine/projects/t3-4/wiki/Aligning_Webinos_APIs_with_latest_W3C_standards

-   No input today.
