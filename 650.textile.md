Multicast and unicast JSON events
=================================

It would be very easy to introduce a means to support inter browser communication across local area networks. This could be exploited for games and a variety of applications.

For browser to browser eventing on local area networks, where you can send a JSON encoded event to a specific browser via a unicast message or to all that are listening via a multicast message, the demo script would look something like:

<pre>
var message_hub = {
 receive: null, // message delivery handler

// to is a string for an IP address, this
 // argument is omitted for multicast events
 send: function (object, to)
 {
 var plugin = document.getElementById("my_plugin");
 plugin.send(message_hub, JSON.stringify(object), to);
 },

// called by the plugin on receiving a message
 dispatch: function (message, from)
 {
 if (message_hub.receive)
 message_hub.receive(JSON.parse(message, from);
 }
};
</pre>

where the above is hidden in a library included by the web page. The multicast address and port for the service would be registered with IANA. The above functionality could be standardized as a new object available as a property of the Window object.

A more sophisticated approach would allow you as a web page developer to designate a markup element as a message hub. You could then register DOM event listeners to handle incoming messages, and send events by targeting events at the hub. The library script would look for elements with a given attribute and add the above behavior. This is feasible as the DOM allows scripts to define new kinds of events. We could then standardize the attribute and the event format.

Note that the library could be written to start and stop listening when the web page registers a listener or removes that listener. This could be implemented via a function exposed by the plugin that takes the listener count as an argument. The use of UDP datagrams imposes a practical limit of a little over 1000 bytes to avoid packet fragmentation. The existing Web Sockets API would be used for larger messages, or for a streamed connection with a given browser.
