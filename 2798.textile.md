Proposed future work on webinos API specifications
==================================================

The following subsections lists potential further work on the API specifictions to be executed by the webinos Foundation.

Updating all APIs to use Promises
---------------------------------

In W3C there is a general request that new asynchronous APIs should use DOM Promises. However, Promise Objects have not yet been properly specified by W3C so W3C specifications that use Promises e.g. the "W3C SysApps APIs":(http://www.w3.org/2012/sysapps/ refer to "WHAT WG promises definition":http://dom.spec.whatwg.org/#promises.

To understand Promises look for example at the "W3C Task Scheduler API Specification":http://www.w3.org/2012/sysapps/web-alarms/. The asynchronous method returns a Promise object. When the operation completes successfully, the Promise object resolver’s internal fulfill algorithm runs. If an error occurs the resolver’s internal reject algorithm runs. So the Promise object could replace the success and error callbacks that we currently have in our specifications.

If we decide to update our API specifications to use DOM Promises this will have the following consequences:

-   The API specification toolchain may have to be updated, i.e. widlproc.exe for Linux, Mac and Windows.
-   The IDL and descriptions for all asynchronous methods in all our API specifications must be updated to the Promise-based syntax.
-   I assume that the webinos platform API implementations and applications have to be updated to be aligned with the updated specifications.

Change from webinos Contacts API to W3C SysApps Contacts API
------------------------------------------------------------

According to the ambition to use standardized solutions as much as possible it is proposed to replace the "webinos Contacts API":http://dev.webinos.org/specifications/api/contacts.html with the W3C SysApps "Contacts Manager API":http://www.w3.org/2012/sysapps/contacts-manager-api/ when this API is considered mature enough.

Change from webinos NFC API to W3C NFC API
------------------------------------------

It is also proposed to to replace the "webinos NFC API":http://dev.webinos.org/specifications/api/nfc.html with the "W3C NFC API":http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/w3c/nfc/blob/master/proposals/common/nfc.html when this API is considered mature enough.

Using W3C DAP sensor APIs
-------------------------

The "webinos Generic Sensor API":http://dev.webinos.org/specifications/api/sensors.html provides access to data from different types of sensors. However, during the time the webinos project has been running some sensor specific APIs have been standardized by the "W3C Device API working group":http://www.w3.org/2009/dap/ (DAP). The stable DAP sensor APIs that overlap sensor types currently included in the webinos Generic Sensor API are "Ambient Light Events":http://www.w3.org/TR/2013/CR-ambient-light-20131001/ and "Proximity events":http://www.w3.org/TR/2013/CR-proximity-20131001/. We also have the exploratory "Ambient Temeperature Events":https://dvcs.w3.org/hg/dap/raw-file/default/temperature/Overview.html, "Ambient Humidity Events":https://dvcs.w3.org/hg/dap/raw-file/default/humidity/Overview.html and "Atmospheric Pressure Events":https://dvcs.w3.org/hg/dap/raw-file/default/pressure/Overview.html.

It is proposed that the W3C standard APIs are used for sensors covered by them instead of using the webinos Generic Sensor API.
