Platform Integrity Protection, Resilience and Attestation
---------------------------------------------------------

### Introduction

Webinos applications will rely upon the runtime environment to provide consistent behaviour and enforce security requirements. Therefore, any unauthorised modification of the webinos runtime could have a catastrophic effect on security and privacy, as the runtime would no longer be expected to enforce policies or properly implement any security functionality.

This section outlines a number of ways in which the webinos runtime will be protected from attacks, as well as how it can report its integrity status to any relying parties.

### Background

#### Requirements

The following security and privacy requirements from the webinos requirements document ([[Deliverable_References#Webinos-D22|Webinos-D22]]) are covered in this part of the platform.

-   "ID-DEV-POLITO-005":http://dev.webinos.org/redmine/projects/wp2-2/wiki/DeliverableVersionAll#ID-DEV-POLITO-005 : A webinos device may be able to provide Attestation of the webinos Platform.
-   "ID-DWP-POLITO-102":http://dev.webinos.org/redmine/projects/wp2-2/wiki/DeliverableVersionAll#ID-DWP-POLITO-102 : Proof of webinos component integrity should be provided to authorised parties.
-   "PS-USR-Oxford-116":http://dev.webinos.org/redmine/projects/wp2-2/wiki/DeliverableVersionAll#PS-USR-Oxford-116 : The webinos Runtime Environment shall protect applications and itself from potentially malicious applications and shall protect the device from being made unusable or damaged by applications.
-   "PS-USR-Oxford-62":http://dev.webinos.org/redmine/projects/wp2-2/wiki/DeliverableVersionAll#PS-USR-Oxford-62 : Applications shall be isolated from each other. An application must not be able to view or modify another application’s data or execution state.

These requirements refer to a webinos runtime’s ability to protect itself from potentially malicious agents (including applications running on the device, software running on another in-zone device, and external threats) and maintain and report its integrity.

#### Threats

These components aim to mitigate the following threats facing the integrity of the webinos platform:

-   Malicious applications exploiting the runtime to get access to underlying hardware, data and other applications
-   An external malicious device attacking the runtime remotely
-   The installation and use of a malicious webinos runtime and interaction with other devices in the personal zone
-   Compromise of a remotely-hosted personal zone hub
-   The use of a trusted remote device (such as a friend’s PC) which turns out to have been compromised by malicious software.

One key attack vector to avoid is a remote exploit of the webinos runtime itself. Because this runtime is aimed to be shared between multiple devices, an exploit could have a "break once run everywhere" effect, much like vulnerabilities in Adobe Flash Player ([[Deliverable_References#CVE-2011-2107|CVE-2011-2107]]).

#### Related technology and research

There are several related areas of research. Trusted Execution Environments have been proposed by ARM with TrustZone (CITE) as well as alternatives in Intel and AMD Processors ([[Deliverable_References#IntelTXT|IntelTXT]]) in order to provide a secure platform for use cases such as payment and digital rights management. GlobalPlatform have produced specifications standardising the Trusted Execution Environment ([[Deliverable_References#GlobalPlatform2010|GlobalPlatform2010]]) which is defined as:

> A Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) is an environment which
> runs alongside a rich operating system and provides security
> services to that rich environment. There are multiple technologies
> which can be used to implement a TEE, and the level of security
> achieved varies accordingly.

Existing mobile security architectures are described in the [[Deliverable_Background|Background]] section of this document. In addition, the Mozilla Security project has discussed process isolation ([[Deliverable_References#MozillaProcessIsolation|MozillaProcessIsolation]]) in order to protect the integrity of the browser.

Attesting platform integrity is an approach proposed and implemented by the trusted computing group. A description and overview of attestation can be found in the TCG specifications ([[Deliverable_References#TCG2007|TCG2007]]), some of which refer directly to mobile trusted platforms ([[Deliverable_References#TCGMobile|TCGMobile]]).

### Components

Most of the planned mitigations to the identified threats are high-level guidelines, rather than specific instructions. This is because many of the actual implementations will depend on the underlying platform and operating system.

There are four principles being followed to mitigate these threats. Firstly, independent platform components should be isolated from each other as much as possible, with interaction over pre-defined channels. Secondly, each component should be as small and conceptually simple as possible. Thirdly, all foreign input must be validated before entering the system. Fourthly, where possible, the programs and modules running on the webinos platform must correspond to a _whitelist_ of known trustworthy programs.

#### Defining the Trusted Computing Base

The Personal Zone Proxy on each device (or the Personal Zone Hub) is the trusted computing base. It is responsible for enforcing security policies, as well as implementing secure storage, holding certificates, making connections and synchronising between devices.

As a result, particular care should be taken in the design and implementation of the personal zone hub. Any features that can be removed from it should be, and additional code review should be undertaken of the personal zone proxy. If possible, the personal zone proxy should be isolated from the rest of the system - perhaps running as a separate process, or virtual machine.

#### Isolation

Applications must run in a sandbox, with access to nothing that is not mediated by the policy enforcement point. Applications must not be able to interfere with each other, and should not be able to identify whether or not another application is installed or running, unless they have been granted this privilege. The method of isolating applications instances from one another is dependent on the underlying platform, but might be implemented as separate processes, separate users or even separate virtual machines.

#### Privileged Applications

Privileged applications are a potential vulnerability in the webinos architecture. The number of them should be reduced as much as possible, and all should be from authenticated sources. More information can be found in the [[Deliverable_Specifications_Privileged_Apps|Privileged Applications]] section.

#### Attestation API

The Attestation API is documented in ([[Deliverable_References#D3-2|D3-2]]). It exposes any underlying device capabilities for _integrity reporting_ that may be available. An example of such a capability can be found in the Trusted Computing Group Specifications for the Trusted Platform Module ([[Deliverable_References#TCG2007|TCG2007]]). This Module allows for the reporting of platform configuration registers (PCRS) which capture the identity of every program executed on the platform. The purpose behind this is to identify malware and check compliance with security policies, including patch levels and anti virus status.

#### Communication firewall

All communications on the overlay network received by the webinos runtime needs to be mediated to make sure that it comes from a (relatively) trusted source. This means that the user might restrict the ability of his or her device to communicate with other devices. For example, it might be that the user does not want to allow communication from unrecognised devices without runtime authorisation, or without changing the current mode of use. Alternatively, only certain types of overlay network communications might be allowed for devices outside of the user’s personal zone. We do not prescribe any particular policy, but do recommend a default:

* All communication within the personal zone is accepted and processed by the target webinos runtime.
 * All communication from devices previously used and authorised is supported for the same purpose as originally approved.
 * All communication from other devices not previous authorised is rejected, unless it is a service advertisement message, in which case it may be accepted unless the device (or message type) is on a blacklist.

The firewall is implemented as part of the PEP and policies are defined in XACML. All communication will be mediated by the PEP.

#### Event validation

Webinos events are described in detail in ([[Deliverable_References#Webinos-D31|Webinos-D31]]). Events are used to communicate between entities for information about state changes, user actions and so on. The following rules apply to events from a security standpoint, in addition to the [[Deliverable_Specifications_API_Groups|permissions framework]]:

* All events must be validated in the way defined in ([[Deliverable_References#Webinos-D31|Webinos-D31]]).
 * Any unrecognised event types (those that no application or service has registered to listen for) must not be accepted or forwarded
 * All input from events must be treated as untrusted data and cleaned and parsed before use
 * Events must come from authorised endpoints unless permitted by the above communications firewall.

#### Example attestation protocol

The following example demonstrates how Attestation might be used to make strong security guarantees of the endpoint. This example is taken from ([[Deliverable_References#Sailer2004|Sailer2004]]).

Application "MyBankApp" is running on the webinos-enabled endpoint "Peter’s Smartphone". Peter’s Smartphone contains a trusted platform module or mobile trusted module. "BankingApp" communicates with remote server "http://bank.example.com". MyBankApp is able to manage the user’s personal finances and let the user make medium-value transactions. As a result, the bank service provider at http://bank.example.com wants to be sure that the correct version of the app is running and that no malware is interfering with the device.

1.  User starts "MyBankApp"
2.  MyBankApp communicates with http://bank.example.com
3.  http://bank.example.com asks MyBankApp to attest to its current status
4.  MyBankApp uses the Attestation API to request a public key & key credential for the local device, Peter’s Smartphone.
5.  The key credential is forwarded to http://bank.example.com
6.  http://bank.example.com assesses the credential and checks to see whether the endpoint is a trusted device.
    1.  If not, attestation fails.

7.  http://bank.example.com gives MyBankApp a fresh _nonce_, a 20 byte random value.
8.  MyBankApp uses this nonce and the public key with the attestation API _attestPlatform_ on Peter’s Smartphone.
9.  Peter’s Smartphone returns attestation data, which includes a log of the integrity of the platform ("trustChain"), as well as validation data from the hardware trusted platform module ("validation data") with schema "TPM_Quote".
10. These values are passed on to http://bank.example.com
11. http://bank.example.com assesses the validation data and the integrity log using standard TCG techniques (see ([[Deliverable_References#TCG2007|TCG2007]])).
    1.  If the platform integrity is not trusted, attestation fails
    2.  If the validation data is not trusted, attestation fails

12. http://bank.example.com passes MyBankApp a temporary token which gives it access to the http://bank.example.com banking capabilities
13. User authentication is requested via the authentication API
14. The application is now able to perform transactions using remote http://bank.example.com APIs.

#### Attestation security and privacy issues

Attestation has well known security and privacy implications, as discussed in [[Deliverable_References#Lyle2010|Lyle10]]:

> "[Attestation] requires the remote party to identify every piece of software executed on the platform. This might allow them to discriminate based on their own criteria, requiring software from only one vendor, for example. This could work against the userâ€™s best interests. Furthermore, reporting the exact [software versions] could make an attackerâ€™s job easier, as he or she will be able to quickly identify which known exploits are appropriate."

### Future directions

In future revisions of this specification, we intend to use the personal zone concept to help check platform integrity. We will investigate integrating a "MAP database":http://www.trustedcomputinggroup.org/resources/tnc_ifmap_binding_for_soap_specification ([[Deliverable_References#MAP|MAP]]) into the personal zone hub to support the creation of policies restricting access to a personal zone based on whether a device is in the correct configuration. MAP databases can be thought of as just simple databases of facts about devices on a network, standardised by the Trusted Computing Group.

In addition to this, we would like to investigate secure cloud hosting for the personal zone hub so that it is protected from attack by outsiders. Integration with the EU TClouds project ([[Deliverable_References#TClouds|TClouds]]) would be one way of doing this.
