Description
-----------

The Application Execution API allows activation of native and webinos applications installed on the device.

In addition, the API will support a facility for performing late run-time binding between different webinos applications. This facility is modeled after Intent mechanism of Android OS. An intent is an abstract description of an operation to be performed, which holds a passive data structure containing an abstract description of an action to be performed. For example webinos application may request the system to show a map using generic intent mechanism. The run-time will then choose which mapping application should be activated to perform the action. The requesting application is not required to have any knowledge of which specific mapping application is installed in the device.

Policies
--------

Operation of Application Execution API is guided by Application Execution Policies, which can be modified by user. The policies control the following aspects of API operation:

-   Enable/disable of activation of native applications
-   Enable/disable of activation of webinos installable applications
-   Enable/disable of notifications to users when a webinos application attempts to activate another application
-   Enable/disable applicationâ€™s ability to discover installed applications
-   Enable/disable of logging of operations performed using the API

Application Execution API provides mechanisms for webinos applications to discover current application execution policies, as well as test if specific webinos application is installed in the device, or is running in the device.

Functional API groups
---------------------

The Application Execution API contains the following groups of functions:

1.  Activation of native app. Due to differences in security models between native and webinos apps, activation of native apps requires user consent. Optional completion code can be passed to the initiating webinos application.
2.  Activation of installable webinos apps. Activated application should be able to pass results to the originating application. The originating application shall be able to receive asynchronous notifications about completion of the activated application.
3.  Sending intents activating generic set of functions. There should be default handler and user selection of alternative handler.
4.  Inquire activation policies to discover current system configuration
5.  Test if specific webinos application is installed in the device
6.  Test if specific webinos application is running in the device
7.  Delivery of system-wide events (e.g. boot or shut-down, power-management) that start webinos app automatically whenever event occurs. This is similar to Android broadcast intents. (registration for the events is performed in webinos app manifest file.) This API is different from general event/messaging API, which is intended to be used to deliver information between two _running_ apps. Broadcast event reception API is intended to deliver system-wide broadcast events, including starting an app that registered event, in case the app is not running.

The following table shows planned implementation status for Phase 1 and Phase 2.
