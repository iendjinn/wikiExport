Background - Foundations
========================

Introduction
------------

The foundations section is about specifying the technological background of webinos applications including application packaging and life-cycle. This also includes functional and non-functional requirements of webinos Web Run-Time (WRT) environments, e.g., how to pass applications to webinos WRTs and how to share applications across WRTs.

Scope
-----

### What’s in scope

Foundations define how webinos look like from a technical point of view. In general it defines the packaging and configuration of webinos applications as well as the life-cycle including requirements on the WRT which are related to application handling and interoperability across WRTs. It also includes how webinos applications can be packaged for distributed application use cases including the exposure of application functions. Thus, applications will be able to share their functionality across distributed components of an application as well as across other full applications.

### What’s out of scope

Allowing Web based applications to access device specific features introduces security risks. The foundations specification does not define the webinos security framework, this is done in separate sections and deliverables, but it includes relations where needed. Also content protection like DRM or licensing is out of scope.

Webinos applications will be created using Web technologies, e.g., JavaScript, CSS and HTML. To achieve a good level of interoperability between WRTs a common set of supported Web technologies is crucial but elaborating on Web technologies to be supported by webinos WRTs and defining which features of which Web technology must be supported is not discussed in the foundations section. Instead, WAC has done much work here and the outcome is referenced and mandated for webinos WRTs.

Review of State of the Art
--------------------------

In general applications have a central entry point for both, installing and executing which makes them easy to transport, install and use. Web technology based applications are commonly hosted on Web servers where each document is linked to other documents which are needed for proper rendering. This approach provides a good mechanism to access an application simply using an URL. But there is a lack of descriptive data for all those content (including e.g. JavaScript). META data like the author, an application description or links to contacting the author can be valuable for the user. This information can be added to native applications like MS Windows executables. In addition, in the Web there is no means to describe which documents belonging to an application and are needed for a proper execution. In this section some recent approaches for packaging Web content together as a whole application are described.

### Google Web application packaging (.crx)

Chrome Google introduced support for installable hosted and packaged Web applications (stored in .crx format). Therefore the developer has to write a JSON based manifest file (manifest.json) that contains some metadata about the application. This manifest.json file must then be placed in a .crx file, which basically is a renamed zip file.

**Example of Usage taken from Google Chrome Developer Page [CRX]**
<pre><code class="javascript">
{
 "name": "Google Mail",
 "description": "Read your gmail",
 "version": "1",
 "app": {
 "urls": [
 "*://mail.google.com/mail/",
 "*://www.google.com/mail/"
 ],
 "launch": {
 "web_url": "http://mail.google.com/mail/"
 }
 },
 "icons": {
 "128": "icon_128.png"
 },
 "permissions": [
 "unlimitedStorage",
 "notifications"
 ]
}
</code></pre>

The JSON example describes the Google Mail Web application as installable hosted application, the application URLs pointing to remote locations using the _web_url_ key. In addition to the provided metadata, HTML5 permissions can be requested during installation. If the user clicks a link to a .crx file within the Chrome Web browser the application is installed to the Google Chrome application Gallery.

If the developer don’t want to maintain a server that serves a hosted application or if he want to provide the best off-line case experience he can create a packaged application. To make an application a fully packaged application the contents are placed in the .crx file and the manifest file must include these details:

<pre><code class="javascript">
 "app": {
 "launch": {
 "local_path": "main.html"
 }
 },
</code></pre>

In addition to access to common Web features installable applications can have access to Google Chrome’s extension APIs, e.g., manipulating context menus or creating background pages. To stimulate the usage of Google’s application packaging, Google’s Web application store supports .crx files which can be uploaded to the store using a developer frontend. Afterwards they are search and brows-able in the store where they can be installed from to the local application Gallery.

### Mozilla Web Applications

In early 2011 Mozilla announced the Open Web Apps project [OpenWebApps] which aims to allow everyone to develop its own Web application store. This also includes the definition of application packages and the possibility of installing them. Mozilla also uses JSON based manifest file that includes human readable and machine readable metadata about the application. Applications are able to "self-install" using an API call provided by Mozilla Browsers (navigator.apps.install()). Manifest files can be served as files where the file extension .webapp or via HTTP where the content type application/x-web-app-manifest-json should be used. Off-line usage is supported through the use of HTML5 AppCache, while an API to check the online status is provided.

**Example of Usage taken from Mozilla Developer Page [OpenWebApps]**
<pre><code class="javascript">
 {
 "version": "1.0",
 "name": "MozillaBall",
 "description": "Exciting Open Web development action![](",
      "icons": {
        "16": "/img/icon-16.png",
        "48": "/img/icon-48.png",
        "128": "/img/icon-128.png"
      },
      "widget": {
        "path": "/widget.html",
        "width": 100,
        "height": 200
      },
      "developer": {
        "name": "Mozilla Labs",
        "url": "http://mozillalabs.com"
      },
      "installs_allowed_from": [
        "https://appstore.mozillalabs.com"
      ],
      "locales": {
              "es": {
          "description": "Â¡AcciÃ³n abierta emocionante del desarrollo del Web)",
 "developer": {
 "url": "http://es.mozillalabs.com/"
 }
 },
 "it": {
 "description": "Azione aperta emozionante di sviluppo di fotoricettore!",
 "developer": {
 "url": "http://it.mozillalabs.com/"
 }
 }
 },
 "default_locale": "en"
 }
</code></pre>

### HTML5 AppCache

W3Câ€™s HTML5 introduced an application cache, which allows Web content available on the local device for off-line usage. Thus, online based applications can be used without internet connection. To add AppCache support to a Website, a specific manifest file must be provided on a server that must be referenced from each HTML page of the whole application. The manifest defines which parts can be online and which must be available offline. In addition a fallback can be provided for the files only accessible when online.

**Example of Usage HTML5 AppCache [AppCache]**
<pre><code class="javascript">
CACHE MANIFEST
NETWORK:
/online.cgi
CACHE:
/offline.css
/offline.js
/offline.jpg
FALLBACK:
/fallback.html
</code></pre>

### W3C Widgets

The W3C Web Applications Working Group started to work on Widget specifications [W3CWidgetFamily], small packaged and installable web applications, back in 2006. Currently the main specifications relatated to packaging and configuration, APIs, and signing are in a last call phase which means that the specifications are mainly completed and W3C recommendations are upcoming. A W3C Widget is basically ZIP file which contains web documents like html, css, or JavaScript in addition to media files like pictures. Everything a Widget needs to be functional must be located in this application package which ensures off-line capability. For describing the content of the package a manifest file is contained which contains meta data like author, application description, desired screen modes and signatures.

Following small example describes a Widget with an attached title an an application icon, which can be shown to the user by the Widget runtime, and a start file, which is used by the Widget runtime to execute the application.

**Example of Usage W3C Widget configuration file**
<pre><code class="xml">
<widget xmlns="http://www.w3.org/ns/widgets">
 <name>Hello World Widget</name>
 <content src="index.html"/>
 <icon src="icon.png"/>
</widget>
</code></pre>

Additional specifications of the W3C Widget family describing API access to the applications meta data, how to update widgets over HTTP, and how to sign and validate the origin of Widgets.

### Opera Widgets

The Opera Widget [OperaWidgets] specification has slightly differences compared to the W3C one. The configuration file contains information about the author, the application, potential icons and security related requirements while the packaging is also a ZIP file with a replaced extension from .zip to .wgt. However, Opera claims that they will support W3C Widgets if the specifications are final. In addition to accessing the configuration documents meta data the Opera APIs providing basic application live cycle management, e.g., allow applications to reacting on events like "gone to background" or "gone to foreground". The following example shows the same semantics than the W3C description.

**Example of Usage W3C Widget configuration file**
<pre><code class="xml">
<?xml version=‘1.0’ encoding=‘UTF-8’?>
<widget>
 <widgetname>Hello World Widget</widgetname>
 <icon>icon.png</icon>
</widget>
</code></pre>

### WAC Widgets

Widgets as specified in the Wholesale Application Community are compliant to W3C Widgets with additions related to security and privacy. For example WAC defines a policy system to protect access to device features and user data which must be declared in the Widget configuration document and evaluated during installation of the Widget.

Recommendations from state of the art
-------------------------------------

W3C Widget specifications describing different parts around packaging and handling Web applications. This includes packaging, signing and the definition of APIs which is all also relevant for Webinos. Also these specifications are in a closely to final stage and will be W3C recommendations soon and the industry is adapting it (e.g., WAC and Opera). Thus Webinos should base its application definition on the W3C Widget specifications and extend them in order to meet additional webinos requirements like distributed application design and exposing functions as service appropriate.
