Device Permissions
------------------

### Introduction

As defined in previous sections, webinos applications must request access to device and runtime features in order to to use them. These requests are defined in the application manifest and at install time, the user is queried to ask whether or not to grant permission. The following table defines the steps and objects required.

Importantly, the user authorisation stage (as discussed in section "[[Deliverable_Specifications_Authorisation|authorisation section]]" of this document) must allow the user to chose which permissions he or she is willing to give. This must be made as user-friendly as possible, so that the user can make a sensible decision with minimal effort. More details of this process are given in the "[[Deliverable_Specifications_Privacy_Policies|Privacy Policy Architecture]]" section. However, one way in which usability can be improved is if device permissions are group logically in order to minimise the number of decisions that users have to make. Users should not have to say yes or no to ever API, but those which are clearly related (or we would expect to see used together) should be presented in the same section.

This part of the specification defines how application states the permissions it wants to use, and to which individual APIs the permissions refer to. The groupings defined in the following sub-sections are liable to change over the course of the development of the webinos project, as feedback from experiments on user expectations of security and privacy should provide better guidelines. Permissions may refer to the applications’ ability to access web addresses, context data and device and runtime features. We note that these things are already defined in the manifest using WARP ([[Deliverable_References#W3CWARP|W3CWARP]]) and the Widget <feature> tag. However, the additional permissions allow us to include more information to present to the end user, including data usage and retention policies. In addition, this provides a logical separation between what the application requires access to functionally and what decisions the user needs to make to protect their security and privacy.

### Background

Device feature permissions have been discussed in several other areas. The W3C "Permissions for Device API Access" ([[Deliverable_References#W3CDAP-Perms|W3CDAP-Perms]]) working draft defines a set of permissions required to access device features. We use many of the same permissions definitions. The W3C Feature Permissions is also a useful reference ([[Deliverable_References#W3CFeaturePermissions|W3CFeaturePermissions]]). There is existing work from WAC specifications ([[Deliverable_References#WAC|WAC]]) in defining permissions for device features. Finally, permissions in android manifests ([[Deliverable_References#AndroidManifestPermission|AndroidManifestPermission]]) are also a point of comparison, although we believe that these are too fine-grained for user authorisation.

### Grouping of webinos APIs and objects

The following APIs will be grouped together with the following permissions strings:

|_.Permission group|_.APIs |_. Parameters |
| servicediscovery | service discovery API | |
| sensorinfo | Device Orientation API | |
| sensorinfo | Generic SensorActuator API | |
| sensorinfo | NFC API | |
| geolocation | Geolocation API | |
| mediacapture | Media Capture API | |
| mediacapture | Gallery API | |
| deviceinfo | Devicestatus API | |
| deviceinfo | Devicestatus vocabulary | |
| deviceinteraction | Device Interaction API | |
| deviceinteraction | User Authentication API | |
| tvcontrols | TV and STB control API | |
| vehicle | Vehicle API | |
| personallife | Contacts API | read/write |
| personallife | Calendar API | read/write |
| personallife | User Profile API | read/write |
| messaging | Messaging API | view/send |
| file | File Reader API | fileuri="URI" |
| file | File Writer API | fileuri="URI"|
| file | File API: Directories and System | |
| file | Storage of cookies | |
| payment | Payment API | |
| otherapplications | Widget execution API | widgeturi="URI" |
| otherapplications | Application Launcher API | widgeturi="URI" |
| otherapplications | Platform Attestation API | |
| context | Context APIs & all implied APIs from Context | |
| events | Event handling API | |

Permissions for individual APIs can also still be requested using this permissions framework.

### Permissions in the Manifest

Applications will request permission to access APIs, web domains and contextual data by including XML fragments such as the one below in the manifest.

<pre>
<permissions>
 <permit type="API/Group/WARP" URI="API Permission/API URI/WARP access origin field">
 <parameters>
 <parameter name="..." value="..." />
 <![](-- E.g. -->
            <parameter name="widgeturi" value="http://example.org/myapp" />
            <parameter name="read" value="true" />
        </parameters>
        <policy> <)— http://www.w3.org/2010/09/raggett-fresh-take-on-p3p/ -->
 <purposes>
 <purpose>current</purpose>
 <purpose>admin</purpose>
 <purpose>tailoring</purpose>
 <purpose>individual-analysis</purpose>
 <purpose>contact</purpose>
 </purposes>
 <recipients>
 <recipient>ours</recipient>
 <recipient>delivery</recipient>
 <recipient>same</recipient>
 <recipient>other</recipient>
 <recipient>unrelated</recipient>
 <recipient>public</recipient> <!— Some of these may subsume others when chosen-->
 </recipients>
 <retention>
 <retention-reason>no</retention-reason>
 <retention-reason>legal-obligation</retention-reason>
 <retention-reason>business-practices</retention-reason>
 <retention-reason>indefinitely</retention-reason>
 </retention>
 <reason>
 <reason-text lang="EN"> … </reason-text>
 <reason-text lang="ES" url="" />
 </reason>
 </policy>
 </permit>
</permissions>
</pre>

A "permit" tag is required for each permission sought. Permissions can be either API groups (as defined earlier), individual API URIs, or for the "access origin" fields used in WARP statements. The "type" field states which of these options the permission is referring to, and the URI either points to the group name, API URI or access origin field. Parameters are required when stated in the above table, and can be used to restrict the permission sought, for example by requesting permission to access only certain files or domains. The policy section is required, and maps to the reduce P3P syntax discussed in the [[Deliverable_Specifications_Privacy_Policies|Privacy Policy Architecture]] section. Purpose is the purpose of using the feature access is requested for, recipients defines who will be given access to any data retrieved, and retention defines whether data will be stored and why. The reason field allows the developer to state a short reason (in text) for this request. We suggest this should be a few lines of text at most. Different languages are supported, and reasons may refer to remote URLs to allow for localisation to happen at a later date. However, at least one reason must be included, and we suggest that these do not point to long legal privacy documents.

### Permissions for accessing context data

Context data is accessed through the context APIs and system defined in [[Deliverable_References#Webinos-D32|Webinos-D32]] and [[Deliverable_References#Webinos-D31|Webinos-D31]]. However, applications can access many other things through the API as it may contain information from other applications and features. As a result, access to context data requires permission to be granted to several other APIs. The details of which APIs will depend on how the platform is defined to collect context data, but may include geolocation, personallife, deviceinfo and more.

Additional security and privacy measures are required for context data. Context data are stored by the runtime in a context database and can be collected whenever the device is turned on. Context data can include information about all aspects of the runtime, APIs and user preferences. In order to help users with security and privacy concerns, we define the following extra controls which the runtime will apply to context data, in addition to the existing permissions requirements:

-   Context gathering and storage is turned off by default in the runtime. Users have to explicitly turn it on in order to begin collecting context data, and can turn it off at any time.
-   Users can always deny an application access to context if they chose to.
-   Context data storage can be emptied and deleted at an time
-   A privileged application exists on the runtime so that users can query the context data and see what it holds at any time

### Security and Privacy Issues

The permissions approach defined in this section has several potential security, privacy and usability concerns. The grouping of permissions might lead to unexpected access being granted to an application which is not in line with user expectations. Furthermore, it might encourage developers to use more features than they were intending, which runs counter to the principle of least privilege. For these reasons, we expect to revise this grouping approach after the study on user expectations is finished later in the year.

The attaching of privacy policies is an important step, but the impact of requiring developers to include them is hard to judge. Privacy policies may be filled in trivially, or copied and pasted from other sources if they are too onerous to complete. Also possible is that the "reason" field will be used to link to a remote privacy policy which will be difficult to read and remain opaque to users. We hope that providing certain fixed, machine-readable fields will help to avoid this scenario. Another potential problem is overloading the user with too much information. While informed consent requires the user to know about the application, too much information could result in users not reading the policies at all.

Another concern is that applications should be discouraged from asking for too many permissions, as this raises user expectations of the number of privileges a "normal" application might ask for. Requiring each permission to have a unique "permit" tag may remove the temptation to request access to too many APIs. However, this could also affect developer usability, and might cause short-cuts such as copying and pasting a large set of permissions rather than tailoring them to the applications. Practical experience may result in these specifications changing in the future.

Finally, access to context data must be strictly regulated otherwise it may serve as a side-channel for access to device APIs. Contextual data may potentially include information from any device API or network, and therefore could be used to access these features without explicit permission.

### Future directions

In phase two of the project, we intend to look at improving permissions in terms of usability and revisit the groupings shown in this document. We will also consider supporting user-definable tags for different APIs and permissions so that users can quickly and easily allow or deny applications access to the data and resource they believe to be sensitive or confidential. We also expect many usability challenges and opportunities will arise during implementation.
