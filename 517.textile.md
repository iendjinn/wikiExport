### Privileged Apps and Services related to Browser and Policy:

This section provides information on how you can create signed JavaScript applications which can access expanded privileges.
Security Policies related to Privileged Apps in JavaScript:

â€¢ **The Same origin policy:** It is a default policy prevents document or script loaded from origin from getting or setting properties from a document or from a different origin.
 The URL should contain same domain should not be different from another. The protocol and Port in the URL should be of the same type.

â€¢ **The Signed Script policy:** The Signed Script policy is based upon the Java security model, called object signing in JavaScript. It uses the JavaScript privileges API and then sign
 your JavaScript scripts.

Signing scripts involves generating a digital signature and associating that signature with the script it signs. By adding the ARCHIVE="..." attribute to a SCRIPT tag to refer to the java archive (JAR) containing the signature for the script.

The JavaScript security model for signed scripts is based upon the Java security model for signed objects from Communicator 4.x. By signing a script using a valid certificate issued from a certificate authority (such as VeriSign) you certify that you are the owner of the script and that the script was not modified before reaching the end user. Because signed scripts offer this proof of identity, only signed scripts can be granted extended privileges by the browser.

### JavaScript Privileges API:

The Javascript Privileges API line of code asking permission to enable a privilege which allows a script to access a target. For example:
netscape.security.PrivilegeManager.enablePrivilege("UniversalPreferencesRead")
 or
netscape.security.PrivilegeManager.enablePrivilege("UniversalPreferencesWrite")

### Privileges in Browser:

Privilege in Browser represents permissions to access a specific target.

-   UniversalBrowserRead - Reading of sensitive browser data. This allows the script to pass the same origin check when reading from any document.
-   UniversalBrowserWrite - Modification of sensitive browser data. This allows the script to pass the same origin check when writing to any document.
-   UniversalXPConnect - Unrestricted access to browser APIs using XPConnect
-   UniversalPreferencesRead - Read preferences using the navigator.preference method.
-   UniversalPreferencesWrite - Set preferences using thenavigator.preference method.
-   UniversalFileRead - Access to file:// URLs.

### Minimize the Trusted Code Base:

The Trusted Code Base (TCB) is the set of code that has privileges to perform restricted actions. One way to improve security is reduce the size of the TCB, which then gives fewer points for attack or opportunities for mistakes.

### Android:

This presentation deals with the Security Frameworks, Policy, Logical Model, Access Controls related to BONDI.

### Feature Permissions related to Notifications:

-   feature id: A string which uniquely identifies a privileged feature.
-   privileged feature: A feature of a user agent which requires the user’s permission before web pages can use it. Examples: may include desktop notifications, geolocation, file system access, etc.
-   origin: "origin" or "security origin" refers to an origin as used by Cross-Origin Resource Sharing. (CORS - is a browser technology specification, which defines ways for a web service to provide interfaces for sandboxed scripts coming from a different domain under same origin policy)

### Permissions interface:

-   Identify the privileged features available in the user agent, using the privilegedFeatures array.
-   Each feature has a unique string identifier in the array.
-   Check the current permissions level of each feature for the current security origin, using the permissionLevel method.
-   Request the user’s permission to use a feature, using the requestPermission method, and receive an asynchronous callback when the user has made a decision.

Input and Output specifications for ‘Privileged Applications’ related to areas like ‘Policy Managementâ€˜

h3. Initial thoughts

* Privileged applications are a special case for policy enforcement as they refer to restrictions placed on the user by the device manufacturer, rather than restrictions on applications and other people as defined by the user.
* The policy architecture must be able to support policies defined by multiple stakeholders
* The policy architecture must be able to protect policies from the user to some extent
* PEP will need to be able to identify the APIs, the application requesting them, and other details like the platform, user, etc.


h2. Polito/Oxford:

Clarify how to enforce policy and security whether it will be built in or an extension to the browser (BONDI)

h3. BONDI


The Bondi access control system is based on application (widget) resource signatures and enforced by the Web Runtime

* resources can be APIs and device capabilities
* signatures are one of the author and at least one of the distributor(s)

Bondi assumes two enforcement points: one at APIs level and one at device capability level.

In order to access an API an application have to
1. declare the API features it needs in a manifest
2. access to those features granted by the current policies

Web Runtime checks the application rights at installation time (if possible) or at instantiation time (for applications not installed on the device)

An API is allowed to access device capabilities on the base of the device policies and API signature

**This schema is in principle suitable for privileged application. However, a better understanding of what are the peculiarities of a privileged application is required. In particular, if it is an application that can override local policies, it must be investigated which kind of security controls can override, and where is stored and managed the list of privileged applications**


h3. Policy management and privileged applications

In our opinion a ’privileged application’ can be:

1) an application that can do sensitive tasks

From Dave email in WP3 ML, 07/Mar/2011 04:09 PM:
> Privileged applications are by definition those apps that request
> additional capabilities, e.g. access to your location or to restricted
> data such as your contacts.

In this case, a privileged application can be managed by normal security framework, using specific policy rules. This should be addressed by policy subgroup and in task 3.5.
Our assumption is that the security framework can identify privileged applications to apply right policies by signature.
We assume that privileged applications are signed by "privileged" signatures, i.e. signatures used only to enable privileges (e.g. an application provider can have two signatures, one for non privileged applications and the other for privileged ones).
We assume to have a policy authority which remotely provides devices with default security policies, to allow privileged applications execution.

2) an application that can use an access restricted API

From Nick email in WP3 ML, 07/Mar/2011 04:24 PM:

In this case it is necessary to introduce a control to check if a privileged application is allowed to call a restricted API. E.g. based on application and API signatures.

Assuming to have a security layer which check security policy for non privileged applications, in this case we may need to extend the policy architecture adding a new security layer to manage restricted API access authorizations of privileged applications.
It is possible to avoid the architecture modification (and manage restricted API with the same policy architecture of the case one), but the restricted API provider need to write its own security policies and to distribute them via the policy authority (e.g. the API provider supplies policies to the policy authority, which possibly approves and distributes them).

Case 1 is enough to implement things like dashboard, installer, launcher, and policy manger. However, in our opinion could be useful to allow both kind of solutions, because case 2 allows direct control over API access by the API provider. E.g., a car manufacturer can write engine monitoring APIs and allow to access them only via the car manufacturer signed applications.

How should the user deal with privileged applications?
