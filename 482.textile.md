Policy Management Meeting 4th March 2011
========================================

Attended:
---------

-   John / Oxford
-   Nick / Impleo
-   Andrea / Polito
-   Dieter / IBBT
-   Davide / UNICT

Actions:
--------

-   John to modify the wiki page to:

* merge "synchronisation" and "Policies referring to diverse objects and ranges of user devices" areas
 * remove the "discovery" area
 * Add the "interpersonal relationships and policies" area.
 * Add the "policy protection and storage" area.

-   Nick to add notes on how the interaction with applications will work.
-   Dieter/IBBT to look into the "Policies referring to diverse objects and ranges of user devices" area (particularly context)
-   ***ALL partners*** to add to the wiki a note listing which areas they will be contributing to, how much effort they expect to spend.

* Proposal: initial notes and summary by 18th March EOB?

Agenda:
-------

* Agreement on the areas and details outlined in the wiki - http://dev.webinos.org/redmine/projects/wp3-1/wiki/Policy_Management
 * Prioritisation of sub-areas
 * Plan to design initial prototype architecture over the next week or two
 * Allocation of work & how to proceed

Other Notes:
------------

* Basic architecture currently just the XACML model.
 * The "interaction with applications" area will need to discuss both javascript interactions and hooks for events like "install", "run", etc. Nick to provide a few rough notes.
 * Native applications should be treated similarly to the "dumb devices" - e.g. can be addressed by and can address webinos. Question: How does a native application delare an intention?
 * ***Proposal:*** that the first step in the "Policies referring to diverse objects and ranges of user devices" area should be to define "policy use cases" referring to the kind of policies we want to specify and what they should do.
 * The problem of specifying policies on multiple sources of the same data (or, in effect, grouping capabilities and writing policies regarding android-like _intents_) is open, but probably of secondary importance compared to the basic architecture.
 * Missing areas - interpersonal relationships (how to define common policies referring to friends/colleagues/partners/etc). Policy protection and storage - how are policies actually stored and how do we protect them from modification?
 * Most innovative area is probably the policy synchronisation and specification of policies for multiple devices. This is a priority.
