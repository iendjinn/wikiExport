Background - Security and Privacy
=================================

Introduction
------------

One of the primary aims of webinos, and of future internet projects in general, is to provide a secure, privacy-preserving internet experience. There are many well-documented problems with security on web applications and the web in general, including weak authentication ([[Background_-_Security#BICH11|BICH11]]) and numerous forms of content injection attacks ([[Background_-_Security#OWASP10|OWASP10]]). Furthermore, mobile devices contain enormous amounts of private and confidential information, the protection of which is paramount for both business and home users. The webinos project has many of the same problems and, by creating a joined-up cross-device application infrastructure, it could be argued that there was an increased potential for harm: attackers - such as the webinos personas Ethan ([[Background_-_Security#D027-Ethan|D027-Ethan]]) and Frankie ([[Background_-_Security#D027-Frankie|D027-Frankie]]) - could potentially steal valuable data or the end user’s identity on every device they own. Furthermore, webinos has multiple stakeholders with different security requirements. Some of these produce contradictions, for example a developer - such as the Jimmy persona ([[Background_-_Security#D027-Jimmy|D027-Jimmy]])- may want to find out demographic data and take advantage of analytics to profile users, whereas users such as Helen ([[Background_-_Security#D027-Helen|D027-Helen]]) wish to preserve their private information. These factors, as well as the diverse number of devices that may be supported by webinos, means that a sound security architecture is of vital importance to the webinos system.

However, the security architecture is also an opportunity to make a significant contribution to the current state-of-the-art in mobile application security and privacy. By introducing a standardised and robust security framework, webinos can potentially increase security and privacy on the four device domains simultaneously. Part of this is due to the fundamental webinos vision of creating a standardised application environment: by providing a unified user interface for making access control decisions, webinos will significantly increase usability and therefore encourage users to make better (and more privacy-friendly) security decisions. This is one place in which existing application architectures are fragmented, as the major mobile operating systems such as iOS and Android have different security models, making the experience less familiar and potentially discouraging users from expressing their privacy preferences. The current systems have also been criticised for having an "all or nothing" approach, with Android and iOS requiring that applications are installed with access to all features the developer asked for, or not installed at all. This has proven unpopular with users, with alternative Android systems appearing which offer the revocation of privileges ([[Background_-_Security#DEME11|DEME11]]). It has also been noted that many applications request more privileges than they need. This means that users are not as cautious of applications which request many privileges as they should be. Webinos is well positioned to provide better solutions than the current state of the art.

The webinos security and privacy architecture is fully outlined in deliverable ([[Background_-_Security#D035|D035]]) but the essential functional components of the policy enforcement mechanism are explained in this document. Implementing a policy enforcement mechanism requires several novel features, including:

# Support for flexible access control policies referring to all APIs and data sources on the webinos platform
# Policies which can refer to cross-device interaction, both inside a webinos "personal zone" and between users with no prior trust relationship
# Synchronisation of access control policies between devices within the webinos personal zone
# Connecting application requests to privacy policies, so that users can make well-informed decisions about their personal privacy.

The security policy system builds on work from WAC ([[Background_-_Security#WAC|WAC]]) and BONDI ([[Background_-_Security#BONDI|BONDI]]) and is based on the XACML language and architecture ([[Background_-_Security#XACML|XACML]]).

Scope
-----

### What’s in scope

This document describes the policy architecture for webinos, and covers the following topics:

-   Access controls for applications. This includes permissions for:
    -   Device APIs, such as features, location services and cameras
    -   Other devices, both inside and outside of the personal zone
    -   Remote content and services
    -   Personal profile data
    -   Other applications on the same device and on other devices
-   Policy synchronisation between a users’ devices
-   Privacy data-usage policies and obligations for applications
-   Application trust chains and certificates

Details on authentication and user identity management are also included in this deliverable in later sections.

### Whats out of scope

The following issues are not included in this document, but are covered either in another deliverable D03.5 or in the second phase of webinos specification:

-   Remote management of devices and remote policy enforcement (phase 2).
-   Implementation details for the protection of applications and the webinos runtime during use (recommendations in D03.5, further details in phase 2).
-   Platform integrity reporting and attestation (specified in D03.2 and discussed in D03.5)
-   Integration with social networking for more usable policies (phase 2)
-   User interface specifications for policy editing and resolution (phase 2 and D03.5)
-   Digital rights management and content protection (phase 2).
-   Detailed specifications of privileged applications (D03.5)

Review of State of the Art
--------------------------

There is a great deal of existing work in access control in general and mobile platforms specifically. A comprehensive summary of related work to security is covered in deliverables D02.7, D03.5 and D03.6.

Recommendations from state of the art
-------------------------------------

The security architecture, much like the rest of the webinos specification, has been designed to reuse as much existing technology as possible. This is particularly important in security, as creating new designs and writing new code will introduce new design flaws and vulnerabilities. Many existing solutions have already undergone extensive testing and will have been patched to fix many outstanding issues. Therefore, we have built primarily on the existing WAC specifications and the general XACML architecture. From the analysis, we can see that these already solve many problems in webinos - such as mediating access to device features - but must be modified to support new requirements.

However, we can also improve on WAC designs by implementing features such as privacy policies which remained underspecified. We propose to take advantage of the work produced by the PrimeLife project to create usable policies which protect user privacy.

Should this go in a global references section?

Yes and no. For the Wiki, it’s much more convenient to have the informatiobn ‘local’ to the chapter. For the formal Word/PDF deliverable, I’ll copy it to a global reference section. (Christian Fuhrhop)
