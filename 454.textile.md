### Device Orientation API

**Description:** Information about the physical orientation of a device, typically implemented by using information from accelerometer, magnetometer and gyro.
**Requirement/architectural reference:** CAP-DEV-SEMC-009:Webinos SHALL provide means for applications to access device physical orientation
**Phase:** Webinos phase 1
**Webinos responsible:** Claes Nilsson/SEMC
|**Candidate API**|**Short Description**|**Implementation Status**|**Gaps**|**Notes**|**Decision**|
|"W3C DeviceOrientation Event":http://dev.w3.org/geo/api/spec-source-orientation.html|Two DOM event types that provide information about the physical orientation of a hosting device.
- The first event is a simple, high-level source of information about the physical orientation of a device, expressed as device rotation in angles around 3 different axes. While the spec is agnostic to the source of information, this is typically implemented by combining information from an accelerometer and a magnetometer.
- The second event provides direct access to motion data from an accelerometer and gyroscope and is intended for more sophisticated applications. Acceleration is expressed in m/s2 and rotation rate is expressed as degrees/s. |iOS 4.2

### Generic SensorActuator API

**Description:** It currently exist a set of APIs tailored for specific sensor data. Examples are the W3C Geolocation API (GPS), the W3C DeviceOrientation Event (accelerometer etc) and the W3C HTML Media Capture API (camera, microphone). However, there is also a need for a generic/extensible API to get access to sensors. This is needed as new types of sensors are frequently introduced. These sensors could be:
* Built in the user’s current device, for example a built thermometer or barometer
* Connected with the user’s current device through a local connectivity method such as USB, Bluetooth or ANT+, for example a Bluetooth enabled medical sensor.
* Located anywhere in "the cloudâ€.

The API should be agnostic to the location of the sensors and to underlying discovery and connection methods.

**Requirement/architectural references:**
* CAP-DEV-SEMC-015: Webinos MUST support a generic/extensible API for allowing applications access to locally connected non-Webinos enabled sensors/actuators.
* CAP-DEV-SEMC-016: Webinos MUST support a generic/extensible API for allowing applications access to Webinos enabled sensors/actuators connected to the Webinos cloud.

**Phase:** Webinos phase 1

|"W3C The System Information API":http://dev.w3.org/2009/dap/system-info/|A high-level API to system information and sensors.
- A set of simple sensor APIs is included in the specification
- Agnostic to underlying sensor access method
- All APIs are asynchronous.
- Simple get value or watch for continuous "callbacks" when the values change or when the values reach below or above certain defined threshold values.
- The sensor properties currently included in the specification are:
 AmbientLight

 Proximity |No known implentations|Gaps:
- For each additional sensor a new sensor property has to be defined
- Reading only, writing data or control sensor not supported
- Only one single value for each sensor property, compound data patterns not supported |This API has been criticized within W3C and the future for this API is uncertain. See: "Sys Info feedback":http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-device-apis/2011Feb/0091.html. There is a proposal to create a set a smaller discrete APIs to specific system properties such as network and battery. For sensors a set of discrete event based APIs similar to the DeviceOrientation Event has been proposed. In addition it is proposed to break out the current sensor part from The System Information API to create a separate "Generic sensor API".||

**Decision:**

A new generic sensor API will be specified. This API is inspired by "W3C DeviceOrientation Event Specification":http://dev.w3.org/geo/api/spec-source-orientation.html, "W3C Battery Status Event Specification":http://dev.w3.org/2009/dap/system-info/battery-status.html and the Android sensor API. For phase 1 only reading, not writing, sensor data will be supported.

Here is an analisys of Media Capture and HTML Media Capture. Notice that both apis require the File api (http://www.w3.org/TR/FileAPI/).

**W3C HTML Media Capture api**

It looks like it has been designed for uploading pictures/audio/videos (it uses the HTML input tag). A "file picker" is launched and it can select an existing file or take a new picture/audio/wideo (I guess using an external app). No options are available before launching the app. It looks like there’s no way to know at js level when the picture/audio/video has been taken. It is not clear if the picture/audio/video is saved on the filesystem.
Supposing we want an app that takes a picture and displays it, here’s a theorical code snippet with HTML Media Capture:

@
 …
 <script type="text/javascript">
 function displayImage() {
 var captureInput = document.getElementById(‘capture’);
 var file = captureInput.files[0];
 document.getElementById("myImage").src = file.url;
 }
 </script>
 …
 <body>
 …
 <input type="file" accept="image/*;capture=camera" id="capture">
 <img id="myImage" src="defaultImage.jpg"/>
 …
 </body>
@

Notice that the displayImage() function should probably be invoked explicitly by the user.

**W3C Media Capture api**

It uses an external app to take the picture/audio/video. A few options are available before launching the app ("limit", that is the number of pictures/videos/audios to take; the duration of the video), and a few have been proposed (height and width of image, format of the output, duration of audio). Error and success callbacks are available. It is not clear if the picture/audio/video is saved on the filesystem (it depends on the external app?).
Supposing we want an app that takes a picture and displays it, here’s a theorical code snippet with Media Capture:

@
 …
 <script type="text/javascript">
 function takePicture() {
 navigator.device.capture.captureImage(successCB, errorCB, { limit: 1 }); //it takes 1 picture and exits
 }
 fucntion successCB(data) {
 document.getElementById("myImage").src = data[0].url;
 }
 function errorCB(err) {
 alert("an error occurred");
 }
 </script>
 …
 <body>
 …
 <button onClick="takePicture()">Take picture</button>
 <img id="myImage" src="defaultImage.jpg"/>
 …
 </body>

h3. Barcode API

**Description:** APIs for decoding barcodes using the camera of the device.
**Requirement/architectural reference:** CAP-DWP-ambiesense-51
**Phase:** Webinos phase 1
**Webinos responsible/editor:** Stefano Vercelli / Telecom Italia.
**Contributor:** Hans Myrhaug, AmbieSense Ltd

|**Candidate API**|**Short Description**|**Implementation Status**|**Gaps**|**Notes**|**Decision**|
|"ZXing":http://code.google.com/p/zxing/ | ZXing (pronounced "zebra crossing") is an open-source (Apache 2.0 licensed), multi-format 1D and 2D barcode image processing library implemented in Java. The focus is on using the built-in camera on mobile phones to photograph and decode barcodes on the device, without communicating with a server. A JavaScript library based on ZXing is proposed. |In reality ZXing is becoming the open source industry standard for barcode recognition in mobile applications and there are fully working implementations on Android and other mobile platforms. "See here for a way to use the library on a mobile device on a webpage.":http://code.google.com/p/zxing/wiki/ScanningFromWebPages|There are concerns that a JavaScript port might be slow.|This (possibly 3rd party provided) library would not be part of a device API but apps could choose to include this library or not based on whether they need the functionality. See "Measurements":http://tobeytailor.s3.amazonaws.com/get_barcode_from_image/index.html that states it takes 40-60 ms to process the image on a Gingerbread Android device with a 1GHz processor. That indicates that porting of Zxing to JS is probably feasible. |Bar code reading will be supported through a JavaScript port of the ZXing Java library. This means that bar code reading is out of scope for further work within WP 3.2|


h2. APIs for which no existing standards/implementations exist

See: "Sys Info feedback":http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-device-apis/2011Feb/0091.html. There is also a proposal to rework the sensor APi to a set of event based APIs according to the DeviceOrientation Event. Comment by Claes/SEMC: Seems as W3C is taking an event model route now for sensors. Consider to make a DOM level 3 event model based Vehice API similar to "DeviceOrientation Event specification":http://dev.w3.org/geo/api/spec-source-orientation.html and "Battery Status Event specification":http://dev.w3.org/2009/dap/system-info/battery-status.html||

**Decision:** A separate Vehilce API will be specified. The API will provide read-access to car data in the first phase of the project. This API is inspired by W3C DeviceOrientation Event Specification, W3C Battery Status Event Specification.

Background information on the vehicle API for the 3.2 deliverable
-----------------------------------------------------------------

In the browser/web domain no developer API has been specified to access vehicle data so far. In other domains there are a few APIs publicly available which provide access to vehicle data, but haven’t been largely used yet.

In JSR 298 the OSGI vehicle expert group (VEG) defined a Telematics API for JAVA. This API provides access to the vehicle data for JAVA Me developers. The OSGI VEG was discontinued in 2006. The API has not been refined afterwards. The specification is available at: http://jcp.org/en/jsr/summary?id=Telematics.

In other EU founded projects the Serial Line Automotive Protocol (SLAP) introduced by Volkwagen has been used to retrieve vehicle data. The SLAP is based on XML-formatted messages to request and receive vehicle data.

Due to the lack of an feasible API for vehicle data inside the browser domain, we define a new API which provides read-only access to the following data:

-   static/general information (brand, model, year, transmission, fuel)
-   trip computer (average consumption1, average consumption2, average speed 1, average speed 2, trip distance, mileage, range)
-   climate control (zone, desired temperature, vent status (automatic or level))
-   controls (lights (including signals, hibeam, fog), whiper )
-   engine (gear, speed, acceleration)
-   park sensors

Furthermore the API provides access to the following functions:

-   setting the destination of the in-car navigation system
-   canceling the guidance of the in-car navigation system
-   querying the in-car navigation system for POIs

The API is aligned to the current W3C’s approach of event based APIs. The vehicle API does not provide information about the geolocation, speed and acceleration. These attributes are already accessible using the W3C Geolocation API for speed and position and the W3C Device Orientation API for acceleration.

In the first iteration of the project the vehicle API focuses on the access of read-only data, which is available on the infotainment bus due to the fact that the in-car headunit is usually connected this bus system as shown in the following depiction.

![](http://dev.webinos.org/redmine/attachments/download/668/vehicle_bus_architecture.jpg)

For the second iteration of webinos the extension of the vehicle API to data outsite of the infotainment bus (MOST) as well as more methods for interacting with the vehicle system seems beneficial.

### NFC API

Near Field Communication (NFC) is an international standard (ISO/IEC 18092) that specifies an interface and protocol for simple wireless interconnection of closely coupled devices operating at 13.56 MHz. The overall application scenario is to hold a device close to a wireless tag to exchange some digital information or data. Alternatively, the scenario is to hold two devices close to each other in order to exchange some information or data between them. NFC is also sometimes referred to as contactless communication.

There are three use case categories for NFC driven by NFC Forum, www.nfc-forum.org:
# NFC peer to peer communication, with use cases for sharing data between devices, and for pairing with other devices.
# Tag R/W mode, with use cases for any application provider proposition integrate real world objects with Internet and applications.
# Card Emulation mode, is to move the existing smart cards that you have in your wallet today into the phone and make use of contactless NFC connections.

All three propositions addressed by use cases of the NFC forum are indeed relevant to the webinos user stories and use cases. Ideally, webinos application developers will therefore need all of these implemented. Thus, in terms of webinos implementaiton priority, we recommend the following order: first 2, then 1, and then 3, because our target group is application developers, and most of them will most likely be doing 2 in the beginning. 1 will become increasingly common when there are a lot of smartphones with NFC capabilities around in the market. Currently, in June 2011, the following NFC enabled devices are being sold in the mass market: Samsung Nexus S and Nokia Oro. The Samsung Galaxy S2 and the Nokia C7 will also be shipped with NFC capability.

  **Candidate API**    **Short Description**   **Implementation Status**                                                                                                                                         **Gaps**   **Notes**   **Decision**
  Android NFC                                  Read write mode is complete. Peer to peer mode is being implemented                                                                                                                      This is our choice because Android is now shipped more than iPhone, the activity is high Android NFC, and the license is Apache 2.0
  Open NFC                                     There are several versions for various platforms becoming available. The information about what is being implemented is unclear.                                                         This is not a choice because the Android implementation is based on the Android NFC API, and it is unclear how much activity this open source project.
  J2ME (JSR-257) NFC                           The implementation is complete several years ago. Due to the current shift in the market, it is less likely that there will be any peer to peer mode supported.                          This is not our choice, because of the shift from J2ME enabled devices towards Android in the current market.
  QT Mobility NFC                              The implementation is complete.                                                                                                                                                          Due to the Nokia announcement on the Microsoft alliance, this seems more risky in the long term.
  Symbian NFC                                  The implementation is complete.                                                                                                                                                          Due to the Nokia announcement on the Microsoft alliance, this seems more risky in the long term.

**Decision:** An NFC API will be specified within Webinos.

**Requirement/architectural reference:** TBD
**Phase:** Phase 1
**Webinos responsible/editor:** Hans Myrhaug / AmbiSense, Stefano Vercelli / TIM
|**High level Requirement**|**Notes**|
|Tag R/W mode|Based on Android NFC API Gingerbread|
|NFC peer to peer communication mode|Based on Android upcoming NFC API|

Below is the proposed roadmap for the webinos API implementation. It seems clear that NFC peer to peer it will be supported on Android and
that it already is supported on both QT and Symbian. Thus, we believe that NFC peer to peer should also be supported by webinos after the NFC read and write capabilities (v=implemented, x=not yet implemented).
