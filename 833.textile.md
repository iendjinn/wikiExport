**Item1.1: Identify Concepts and (initial) attributes in the context model**
GeorgeG: we had some "back-n-forth" trying to integrate input from email discussions, i.e. on whether we need to have social relationships in the representation of the User profile, how we can do this, etc. We have finalized three objects User, Social Profile and Device and by eob we try to have online the Applications object and its Connections.

**Item1.2: Define the Form and Representation of the context model**
Hans: will update later in the day the wiki.we need an extensible context awareness framework so that applications developers can define their own context data?

Heiko: wonâ€™t this cause an over fragmentation (GeorgeG also has the same questions)?

Hans: gives an example with a social networking application which store social data tha probably other applications may not require.

Heiko: is the developer free to define the new concept (i.e. the context data) however he wants?

Hans: As long as he follows specific guildelines he should be able to sandbox whatever he wants.

GeorgeG: how are we going to communicate what the new context data - defined by the application - mean?

Heiko: it is also a question on whether other applications can understand what the data.

Dietter: it will be difficult for us to restrict access to the data.

John: Applications should be able to store their own data (maybe even context data) BUT this needs to be in their own space.

Hans: Is it a questions of accessing or storing data?

Dieter: the way you store data also affect the capacity to acess them.

**Item1.3 Define the Storage and Extensibility Framework**
Heiko: triple storage is still in experimental stage, yet today in several mobile devices we already have sql lite support.

**What we will include in next weekâ€™s deliverables**

*from Item 1.1 we will have the listo of objects, attributes and their connections. Also we will have a list of permission about what kind of (context) data are available to which entity

* from item 1.2 we will have uml diagrams and descirption (probably provide some more input so that we are on the same page)

+ from item 1.3 the storage facillity, the pluggable architecture and the reasoning on top of it

+ the general architecture proposal

GeorgeG: how are we going to describe the context API according to the webinos guideline (webIDL and list of attributes)
