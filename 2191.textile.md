Key Storage
===========

<pre> I suggest we cover platform specific details for key storage in pzp deployment, no need to keep a separate section </pre>

Scope
-----

All devices and services within webinos use private keys to authenticate themselves. These keys are vital to securing personal zones and the policy framework. This informative specification defines a number of options for how keys can be stored on each platform to best protect against certain threats. This includes the PZH and all PZPs.

Gap Analysis
------------

<pre>
Once the user is authenticated to a device, the device reveals access to the secure storage which keeps the private key in a protected environment.
</pre>

Secure storage has been investigated (http://dev.webinos.org/redmine/projects/wp4/wiki/Secure_Storage_Analysis) and an implementation proof of secure storage was provided for node 0.4. It was no longer developed so presently is in the status of early prototype. Where available, the system keyring is used to securely store attributes.

<pre>
The PZP is the only entity which can access the private key. The PZP uses the private key for mutual authentication within the zone and
across zones, and for integrity and confidentiality of communication between devices.
</pre>

Private keys are usually stored in plain in the file system, so easily accessible by any other entity on the same device. The use of keyring provide some encryption, and it requires authentication before being accesible. However, even if stored in the keyring, other authorized entities (outside webinos) can access it as well, since itâ€™s not a specific PZP store.
