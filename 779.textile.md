API landscape
=============

This section is an overview of existing API standardization and collaboration projects.

World Wide Web Consortium (W3C)
-------------------------------

The "World Wide Web Consortium (W3C)":http://www.w3.org/ is an international community where Member organizations, a full-time staff, and the public work together to develop Web standards. W3C’s mission is "to lead the Web to its full potential". W3C is the most important organization for standardizing web technology and an extensive set of APIs for web application developers have been specified by W3C.

**W3C Web Applications (Web Apps) Working Group**

The W3C Web Applications WG provides specifications that enable improved client-side application development on the Web, including specifications both for application programming interfaces (APIs) for client-side development and for markup vocabularies for describing and controlling client-side application behavior.

This WG hosts a number of API specifications that are core for the web as an application execution environment. APIs that are implemented in all browers are for example XMLHTTPRequest and Document Object Model (DOM). Other important APIs created by the Web Apps WG that are deployed in modern browers are for example Web Workers, Web Messaging, File Reading, Server-Sent Events and Web Sockets. The Web Apps WG has also created a set of specifications for installable web applications, Web Widgets, that for example are core specifications in web runtime platforms such as "WAC":http://www.wacapps.net/web/portal/wac-2.0-spec.

See "Web Apps WG charter":http://www.w3.org/2010/webapps/charter/Overview.html and "Web Apps WG Web Site":http://www.w3.org/2008/webapps/. A full list of the WG’s publications and their status can be found at "Web Apps WG publications":http://www.w3.org/2008/webapps/wiki/PubStatus.

**W3C Device APIs and Policy (DAP) Working Group**

The mission of the Device APIs and Policy Working Group is to create client-side APIs that enable the development of Web Applications that interact with device hardware, services and applications such as the camera, microphone, system sensors, native address books, calendars and native messaging applications. Devices in this context include desktop computers, laptop computers, mobile Internet devices (MIDs), cellular phones, TVs, cameras and other connected devices.

A full list of API specifications created by the WG is here: "DAP Roadmap":http://www.w3.org/2009/dap/#roadmap.

The DAP specifications that so far has got most implementation attention are the Contacts API for which there are experimental implementations and the HTML Media Capture API, which for example will be supported in Android 3.0.

Previously a framework for the expression of security policies that govern access to security-critical APIs was included in the deliverables of the WG but according to the "new proposed DAP charter":http://www.w3.org/2010/11/DeviceAPICharter.html this is now left out of the DAP WG deliverables. It is proposed to rename the WG to "Device APIs Working Group". However, this does not mean that the WG no longer addresses privacy and security as the group also aims at crafting APIs that are both secure and privacy-enabling by design, based on the current Web browser security model. This entails reusing existing browser-based security metaphors where they apply and looking into innovative security and privacy mechanisms where they donâ€™t.

Furthermore, the new charter expands the set of APIs that should be delivered by the WG. For example APIs for device and service discovery is now inluded in the charter.

DAP’s public web site is here: "W3C DAP":http://www.w3.org/2009/dap/.

**W3C Geolocation Working Group**

The mission of the Geolocation Working Group is to define a secure and privacy-sensitive Geolocation API for accessing location information from device GPS receiver or network positioning information as well as a Device Orientation Event specification for using device orientation information originating from device accelerometer, magnetometer and gyro.

The Geolocation API is currently implemented in major modern web browsers and according to public information the Device Orientation Event specification is at least under implementation for iOs, Android and Chrome.

See the "Geolocation WG Charter":http://www.w3.org/2008/geolocation/charter/charter-2.

**W3C Web Real-Time Communications (Web-RTC) Working Group**

The mission of the recently formed Web Real-Time Communications Working Group is to define client-side APIs to enable Real-Time Communications in Web browsers. APIs specified by the WG will enable streaming access to device capabilities, e.g camera and microphone, and API functions for establish peer-to-peer connections between Web browsers, independent of the network protocols used to establish the connections between peers.

See "Web-RTC Working Group Charter":http://www.w3.org/2011/04/webrtc-charter.html and "Web-RTC web site":http://www.w3.org/2011/04/webrtc/

**Other W3C actvities creating APIs for web applications**

-   The "HTML5 specification":http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/ contains a number of APIs for web applications, e.g. an API for playing of video and audio to be used with the video and audio elements, an API that enabling offline Web applications and a drag & drop API.

-   The "Web Notifications API":http://www.w3.org/TR/notifications/ is an API for displaying simple notifications to the user.

-   The "Web Events Working Group":http://www.w3.org/2010/webevents/ develops specifications for physical multitouch interface events.

-   The "HTML Speech Incubator Group":http://www.w3.org/2005/Incubator/htmlspeech/ investigates the feasibility of integrating speech technology in HTML5.

Web Hypertext Application Technology Working Group (WHATWG)
-----------------------------------------------------------

"WHATWG":http://www.whatwg.org/ is a community of people interested in evolving the Web. It focuses primarily on the development of HTML and APIs needed for Web applications. The WG was founded by individuals of Apple, the Mozilla Foundation, and Opera Software in 2004, due to concerns on the W3Câ€™s direction with HTML and XHTML.

WHATWG has provided major input to the W3C HTML5 specification as well as to other specifications relating to web applications, e.g. Web Workers , Web Storage, the Web Sockets API, and Server-Sent Events.

Wholesale Application Community (WAC)
-------------------------------------

The "Wholesale Applications Community (WAC)":http://www.wacapps.net/web/portal is an open, global alliance formed from the world’s leading telecoms operators. WAC will unite a fragmented applications marketplace and create an open industry platform that benefits the entire ecosystem, including applications developers, handset manufacturers, OS owners, network operators and end users.

WAC is based on W3C web technology such as HTML5, JavaScript, DOM and web widgets. In addition WAC has specified a set of APIs providing access to hardware and software device capabilities as well as a security policy framework to control the access to the sensitive device APIs.

Full list of WAC specifications can be found here:
* "WAC 1.0":http://specs.wacapps.net/1.0/dec2010/
* "WAC 2.0":http://www.wacapps.net/web/portal/wac-2.0-spec

PhoneGap
--------

"PhoneGap":http://www.phonegap.com/ allows developers to build applications with web technology that are wrapped into native applications suited for the target platform giving access to APIs provided by the native platform. The following table lists the APIs available for the platforms supported by PhoneGap: "PhoneGap supported feature":http://www.phonegap.com/features. For API documentation see "PhoneGap API reference":http://docs.phonegap.com/.

Nokia/Symbian Web Runtime environment
-------------------------------------

The "Nokia/Symbian Web Runtime (WRT)":http://library.forum.nokia.com/index.jsp?topic=/Web_Developers_Library/GUID-A359B122-CB52-492C-8C0D-0062ED0A6A89.html provides an application environment for web widgets that includes a set of device APIs, "Symbian Platform Services 2.0 ":http://library.forum.nokia.com/index.jsp?topic=/Web_Developers_Library/GUID-A359B122-CB52-492C-8C0D-0062ED0A6A89.html.
