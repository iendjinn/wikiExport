microPZP Introduction
=====================

A full-featured PZP implements a rich set of functionality, including the ability to run interactive webinos apps, to expose locally-implemented APIs to those apps, and to remote connected clients. This functionality naturally entails that the device hosting the PZP has certain capabilities â€“ either explicitly (for example means for display and user interaction) and also implicitly (for example having sufficient memory and connectivity to be able to support a PZP).

However, there is a wide class of potential webinos platforms, ranging from small personal devices to mass-deployed IOT nodes, that are not required to support the full range of PZP functionality and have only limited hardware capability; factors such as device cost, battery life or connectivity would prevent such devices from being able to host a fully-featured PZP. These might be intended to expose locally-implemented APIs to remote clients, but are not required to support other PZP functionality such as being able to run local applications.

The microPZP, specification establishes the basis on which such limited devices can expose services conforming to the webinos architecture.

Characteristics of a micro PZP
------------------------------

A device may be unable implement a full PZP if one or more of the following conditions are satisfied.
* the device is minimally interactive, or its interaction is not user-programmable;
* the device has limited available memory, either code space or runtime heap, for the PZP and/or insufficient memory to be able to run applications locally;
* the device has limited network connectivity, or is connected but unable to support TLS or even TCP/IP.

Despite these constraints, such a device may support a microPZP if it is technically capable of hosting at least one locally-implemented API that can be exposed to remote clients and is capable of conformance with the relevant webinos API specification.

Differences between a microPZP and a standalone device
------------------------------------------------------

webinos supports interconnection of a standalone sensor or actuator (such as an ambient temperature sensor) to a PZP. The interconnection of such standalone devices is not standardized by webinos but would typically use a sensor-specific protocol (such as the Bluetooth Health Device Profile for a blood pressure monitor). In this case the relevant webinos API is implemented at the PZP based on data obtained from the attached sensor, but the webinos protocol(s) terminate at the controlling PZP.

The microPZP architecture, on the other hand, allows the webinos protocol to be extended all the way to the end device. Certain devices could be attached as PZP-hosted sensors or as a microPZP in their own right. The following factors should be considered when deciding whether a given end device should be integrated as a PZP-attached sensor or actuator, or as a microPZP.

-   A microPZP might be intrinsically associated with a user â€“ either it is natural for it to be discovered by searching for devices or services associated with that user, or it has state that is relevant to a user. A sensor, by contrast, provides information based only on how and where it is deployed, and this might be only indirectly associated with a user. For example, compare a GPS sensor which only reports location, with a GPS-based navigation device that also contains a userâ€™s favourites, preferences, settings and history.
-   A microPZP contains sufficient local state, or sufficient interactive capability, that it can make non-trivial access control decisions itself, involving webinos subject attributes, rather than simply being configured to enable or disable access based on fixed connection parameters.
-   A microPZP is capable of attachment to a network, either via a proxy or directly, so as to be able to provide a service autonomously without continuous support from a PZP.

It is perhaps most natural to think of a micro PZP as a device with a recognizable identity as opposed to an accessory attached to another device.

Micro PZP implementation
------------------------

It is possible to implement a microPZP by subsetting the reference PZP implementation. However, in recognition of the range of potential microPZP devices and their limited resources, it is also appropriate to explore alternative implementations that are entirely new and are able to operate within a much smaller footprint by being focused on the limited functional requirements of a microPZP.

Classes of microPZP
-------------------

There are no defined microPZP profiles. Implementations, however, fall into the following two classes:

-   TLS-capable devices. These are capable of attachment to an IP network, of securely storing keys and certificates, and sustaining end-to-end TLS connections with clients. Other networking limitations may exist relative to a full PZP: for example there may be support for only a strictly limited number of connections. However, following enrolment, service discovery and binding, a client can interact with a service using the standard webinos JSON-RPC/TLS protocol.

-   Tethered devices. These do not support TLS end-to-end and do not necessarily support IP connections. They are attached via a bus or Personal Area Network (PAN), and connectivity to the IP network is via an intermediary proxy. The requirements for the bus and the proxy are described in the sections that follow.
