Introduction -and gap analysis-
---------------------------------

The role of the policy manager is to enforce privacy and access control requests - coming from local and remote requestors - in order to manage the disclosure of personal data and to control access to personal zone capabilities and features. This is done by matching requests to resources from users and applications against written policies in order to determine an access control decision. This decision could be to allow or deny access to the requested resources, or involve further interaction and consent with the resource owner.

The task 3.1 specified mainly the access control architecture and how to integrate it with a privacy management architecture which was not completely defined.

The specification proposed in the task 3.1 was not fully implemented during task 4.1. In particular
In the current implementation the policies are written in an xml file (following the format specified "here":http://dev.webinos.org/redmine/projects/wp3-1/wiki/Spec_-_Security#Policy-Format in task 3.1). In this file it’s possible to specify multiple sets of policies: every set has a "combine" rule that is used to determine which policy shall be applied, eg. with the "first-matching-target" combine rule, every request shall be matched against the first policy which matches the request’s target. At the actual stage of implementation, the target of a policy could be users, apps, devices or mix of them.
The policy manager can recognize every feature specified for APIs in the task 3.2 ("APIs specs":http://dev.webinos.org/specifications/draft/index.html) and also the ones specified "here":http://dev.webinos.org/redmine/projects/wp3-1/wiki/Spec_-_Security#Action-features in the task 3.1.
The policy manager defines also through it’s Node.js wrapper, a method to enforce requests: an example of usage can be found "here":http://dev.webinos.org/redmine/projects/wp4/wiki/W3C_contacts_module .
At the moment only the Contacts Module, Device Status API, the Context Manager and some demos have integrated the policy enforcement.

### Main differences: 3.1 specs vs 4.1 implementation

These are the main differences between the current implementation and what has been specified:

-   there are not PIP and Context Handler, since it was expected a deeper integration between policy and context manager. Management of obligations is not implemented as well.

-   The Policy manager action is voluntary, in the sense that calls to policy manager functions must be explicitly inserted. This seems slightly contrasting with the PEP put in the XACML engine (in T3.1 specification), that suggest a mandatory control for all APIs (BTW, this would be in line with the Context manager behavior, which listen every RPCs)

-   The privacy part (DHDF, P3P etc) has been investigated but not implemented.

-   Different prompt types are not fully implemented (the Policy manager is ready to be extended with "session" and blanket" prompt types, but at the moment only _one-shot_ is fully available).
-   actual implementation lacks of a mechanism to synchronize policies and taken decisions (PDP Cache) among devices
-   IDs in policies are not stored in "Trusted records" and the generic values for targets cannot be used

Focus
-----

In this task the focus should be on the privacy management system (proposed architecture review + privacy policies language) and on a more detailed mechanism to share policies and related resources among users’ devices.
Another point to work on are the privileged applications: for example in this task the functionalities for a graphic policy editor could be defined.
