Web Application API Landscape - updated
=======================================

This page provides an overview of existing API standardization and collaboration projects.

World Wide Web Consortium (W3C)
-------------------------------

The "World Wide Web Consortium (W3C)":http://www.w3.org/ is an international community where Member organizations, a full-time staff, and the public work together to develop Web standards. W3C’s mission is "to lead the Web to its full potential". W3C is the most important organization for standardizing web technology and an extensive set of APIs for web application developers have been specified by W3C.

webinos uses W3C APIs for web applications to the extent possible. However, in a few cases an existing W3C API specification has not fulfilled the neeeds of webinos so it has been necessary to extend the W3C specification with webinos specific APIs.

**W3C HTML Working Group**

The W3C HTML Working Group provides the "HTML5 specification":http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/, the Document Object Model (DOM) API and the Canvas API. These APIs serve as the basis for a large number of Web applications.

See the "HTML Working Group charter":http://www.w3.org/2013/09/html-charter.html, the "HTML Working Group home page":http://www.w3.org/html/wg/, and its "full list of the specifications":http://www.w3.org/wiki/HTML/Publications.

**W3C Web Applications (Web Apps) Working Group**

The W3C Web Applications WG provides specifications that enable improved client-side application development on the Web, including specifications both for application programming interfaces (APIs) for client-side development and for markup vocabularies for describing and controlling client-side application behavior.

This WG hosts a number of API specifications that are core for the web as an application execution environment. APIs that are implemented in all browers include for example XMLHTTPRequest. Other important APIs created by the Web Apps WG that are deployed in modern browers are for example Web Workers, Web Messaging, File Reading, Server-Sent Events and Web Sockets. The Web Apps WG has also created a set of specifications for installable web applications, Web Widgets, that for example are core specifications in web runtime platforms such as "Tizen":https://www.tizen.org/.

See "Web Apps WG charter":http://www.w3.org/2012/webapps/charter/ and "Web Apps WG Web Site":http://www.w3.org/2008/webapps/. A full list of the WG’s publications and their status can be found at "Web Apps WG publications":http://www.w3.org/2008/webapps/wiki/PubStatus.

**W3C Device APIs (DAP) Working Group**

The mission of the Device APIs Working Group is to create client-side APIs that enable the development of Web Applications that interact with device hardware, services and applications such as the camera, microphone, system sensors, native address books, calendars and native messaging applications. Devices in this context include desktop computers, laptop computers, smart phones, TVs, cameras and other connected devices. See the "DAP WG charter":http://www.w3.org/2011/07/DeviceAPICharter.

A full list of API specifications created by the WG is here: "DAP Roadmap":http://www.w3.org/2009/dap/#roadmap.

Given the sensitive nature of the data and sensors to which these APIs grant access, the Working Group also aims at crafting APIs that are both secure and privacy-enabling by design, based on the current Web browser security model. This entails reusing existing browser-based security metaphors where they apply and looking into innovative security and privacy mechanisms where they donâ€™t.

DAP’s public web site is here: "W3C DAP":http://www.w3.org/2009/dap/.

**W3C Web Intents task force**

Web Intents is a service discovery mechanism and light-weight RPC system between web apps, modeled after the similarly-named API in Android. In W3C a joint DAP WG / Web Apps WG task force was running. See "W3C Web Intents wiki":http://www.w3.org/wiki/WebIntents and "W3C Web Intents public mailing list archive":http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-web-intents/. Google was the main driving player for Web Intents and editor of the "W3C draft Web Intents specification":http://dvcs.w3.org/hg/web-intents/raw-file/tip/spec/Overview.html. They also manage the "webintents.org site":http://webintents.org/ that contains use cases and examples of Web Intents services.

In addition Sony has provided the "Web Intents Addendum - Local Services specification":http://w3c-test.org/dap/wi-addendum-local-services/ that defines how Services on Web Intents enabled UPnP and mDNS devices can be discovered and accessed.

Due to usability issues the work on Web intents has been halted and the Web Intents task force is currently not active. However, webinos was active in the task force and the basic concept of a high level service discovery mechanism is together with the webinos service discovery system very valuable inputs to a potenatial W3C standard on a general high level service discovery mechanism.

**W3C System Applications Working Group**

The System Applications Working Group is chartered to define a runtime environment, security model, and associated APIs for building Web applications with comparable capabilities to native applications. This requires stronger integration with the host platform than is the case for traditional web pages.

The main distinction between the scope of the DAP WG ("APIs for browser based Web Applications"), and the System Applications WG ("APIs for System Web Applications") is the security model. For the System Applications Working Group the mission is to define a runtime environment, security model, and associated APIs for building Web applications with comparable capabilities to native applications. This requires stronger integration with the host platform than is the case for traditional web pages. Browsers are designed to cope with the user visiting untrusted web sites, necessitating a cautious approach to security that narrowly limits what a particular website can do. The contrast between the two contexts can be illustrated by comparing a) an application with limited access to specific fields in the user’s contacts, and b) an application that implements a contacts manager, where the application is entrusted with the ability to access, create, delete and update entries.

See the "System Applications WG web site":http://www.w3.org/2012/sysapps/ and the "System Applications WG charter":http://www.w3.org/2012/09/sysapps-wg-charter.html.

Note that the APIs and runtime model specified in the System Applications WG are very relevant to webinos as the secure runtime environment in webinos makes it possible to expose more sensitive APIs to web applications than what is possible in the traditional web browser.

**W3C Geolocation Working Group**

The mission of the Geolocation Working Group is to define a secure and privacy-sensitive Geolocation API for accessing location information from device GPS receiver or network positioning information as well as a Device Orientation Event specification for using device orientation information originating from device accelerometer, magnetometer and gyro.

The Geolocation API is currently implemented in major modern web browsers and according to public information the Device Orientation Event specification is at least implemented in iOs browser, Android browser, Chrome, Firefox for Android and Opera Mobile for Android.

See the "Geolocation WG Charter":http://www.w3.org/2008/geolocation/charter/charter-2. A new charter has recently been suggested that includes a "Geolocation API level 2" specification. The proposed added functionality is indoor positioning and geofencing. The latter is a feature making it possible to define geographical boundaries. This can be used for example to trigger alerts when people enter or leave certain geograhical areas.

**W3C Web Real-Time Communications (Web-RTC) Working Group**

The mission of the Web Real-Time Communications Working Group is to define client-side APIs to enable Real-Time Communications in Web browsers. APIs specified by the WG are enabling streaming access to device capabilities, e.g camera and microphone, and API functions for establish peer-to-peer connections between Web browsers, independent of the network protocols used to establish the connections between peers.

See "Web-RTC Working Group Charter":http://www.w3.org/2011/04/webrtc-charter.html and "Web-RTC web site":http://www.w3.org/2011/04/webrtc/

**Other W3C actvities creating APIs for web applications**

-   The "Web Notifications API":http://www.w3.org/TR/notifications/ is an API for displaying simple notifications to the user.

-   The "Web Events Working Group":http://www.w3.org/2010/webevents/ develops specifications for physical multitouch interface events.

-   The "HTML Speech Incubator Group":http://www.w3.org/2005/Incubator/htmlspeech/ investigates the feasibility of integrating speech technology in HTML5.

-   The Near Field Communications (NFC) Working Group is being chartred. NFC is a form of short range wireless communication in which NFC devices such as mobile can communicate with each other over a typical distance of 4cm or less. See "W3C NFC WG draft charter":http://www.w3.org/2012/09/nfc-wg-charter and the "NFC WG web site":http://www.w3.org/2012/nfc/.

-   The Audio Working Group is chartered to develop specifications which define a client-side script API adding more advanced audio capabilities than are currently offered by audio elements. See "W3C Audio WG charter":http://www.w3.org/2011/audio/charter/.

-   The Web Web Cryptography Working Group defines a high-level API providing common cryptographic functionality to Web Applications. See "W3C Web Web Cryptography Working Group charter":http://www.w3.org/2011/11/webcryptography-charter.html

For more information on W3C standards for Web Applications on Mobile see "Standards for Web Applications on Mobile: current state and roadmap":http://www.w3.org/Mobile/mobile-web-app-state/. This document summarizes the various technologies developed in W3C that increase the capabilities of Web applications, and how they apply more specifically to the mobile context.

Web Hypertext Application Technology Working Group (WHATWG)
-----------------------------------------------------------

"WHATWG":http://www.whatwg.org/ is a community of people interested in evolving the Web. It focuses primarily on the development of HTML and APIs needed for Web applications. The WG was founded by individuals of Apple, the Mozilla Foundation, and Opera Software in 2004, due to concerns on the W3Câ€™s direction with HTML and XHTML.

WHATWG has provided major input to the W3C HTML5 specification as well as to other specifications relating to web applications, e.g. Web Workers, Web Storage, the Web Sockets API, and Server-Sent Events.

WHATWG is a "W3C Community Group":http://www.w3.org/community/about/#cg.

Mozilla Firefox OS
------------------

"Firefox OS":http://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/os/ is a true Web-based Mobile Platform, i.e. a browser based Operating System built entirely on HTML5, Javascript and CSS without the need for an intermediate OS layer.

The Firefox OS project is based on standard APIs but when standards are missing additional APis have been implemented. Examples are: Telephony API, SMS API, Bluetooth API and USB API. See "Mozilla WebAPI":https://wiki.mozilla.org/WebAPI. Mozilla is also working in W3C, e.g. in the System Applications WG, to achieve a standardized web system environment based on their experiences with Firefox OS.

Tizen
-----

"Tizen":https://www.tizen.org/ provides an operating system and applications based on HTML5. The Tizen SDK and API allow developers to use HTML5 and related web technologies to write applications that run across multiple device segments including smartphones, tablets, netbooks, in-vehicle infotainment devices, smart TVs, and more.

The Tizen project resides within the "Linux Foundation":http://www.linuxfoundation.org/collaborate/labs/tizen.

Tizen both uses W3C API specifications and defines their own additional APIs, e.g. Bluetooth API, Content (Media) API and NFC API. See "Tizen Dev Guide 2.2.1":https://developer.tizen.org/documentation/dev-guide/2.2.1.

Apache Cordova (former PhoneGap)
--------------------------------

"Apache Cordova":http://cordova.apache.org/ allows developers to build applications with web technology that are wrapped into native applications suited for the target platform giving access to APIs provided by the native platform.

See "Cordova documentation":http://cordova.apache.org/docs/en/3.1.0/ for API references.

"Phonegap":http://phonegap.com/ still exists as a brand and provides tools on top of Cordova.

Google Chrome installable application APIs
------------------------------------------

"Google Chrome installable apps":http://developer.chrome.com/apps/about_apps.html deliver an experience as capable as a native app, but as safe as a web page. Just like web apps, Chrome Apps are written in HTML5, JavaScript, and CSS. But Chrome Apps look and behave like native apps, and they have native-like capabilities that are much more powerful than those available to web apps. Sensitive APIs can be used by Chrome apps. See "Chrome Platform APIs":http://developer.chrome.com/apps/api_index.html.

Wholesale Application Community (WAC)
-------------------------------------

The "Wholesale Applications Community (WAC)" was an open global alliance made up of leading communications companies including network operators, device and network equipment manufacturers, that was committed to make it easier for developers to innovate by using operator network APIs delivered by a single cross-operator API platform. WAC has been folded into the GSMA, the mobile industry trade body, in "OneAPI":http://www.gsma.com/oneapi/.

Some WAC API specifications have served as starting point/inspiration for webinos APIs. The full list of WAC specifications is here:
* "WAC Specifications 2.1":http://specs.wacapps.net/
* "WAC 1.0":http://specs.wacapps.net/1.0/dec2010/
