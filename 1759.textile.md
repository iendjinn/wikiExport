Introduction
============

Final update done.

{{toc}}

This suite of documents, coded D03.3 in the webinos project, provides detailed technical specifications for the webinos platform. They succeed the webinos scenario, use cases and requirements specifications [WOS21, WOS22, WOS24, WOS25]. They are the webinos project Phase II specifications that supersede the project Phase I deliverable D03.1. Users should refer to these documents instead of D03.1.

1 Intended audience
-------------------

The primary intended audience are developers of the webinos platform and developers of webinos applications, as defined in [WOS25, p17, p18]. Other users who may find these documents useful include, but are not limited to, webinos enabled device manufacturers, webinos application service providers and network providers [WOS25, p17, p18]. For webinos platform developers these documents are the complete implementation guide and the requirements for a conformable webinos implementation. The developers should refer to these documents during the development process and any maintenance of and future extensions to the platform. For developers of webinos applications this document provides an insight into the platform and will help the developers make the best use of webinos features to enrich their applications in development.

2 What is webinos?
------------------

Increasingly, users are owning more connected devices and expecting applications to keep preferences and status information synchronised across devices in different domains. The purpose of the webinos project is to define and deliver an open source platform, which will enable web applications and services to be used and shared consistently and securely over a broad spectrum of connected devices. To achieve this, it defines and provides an architecture and infrastructure to allow applications to run not only on a single device, but also across devices and domains. This applies to device features as well. New APIs are also provided to allow access to local and remote device resources and network resources in the Cloud.

Webinos, as defined in [WOS21, p14] and [WOS22, p6], is a cross-domain platform for secure web application delivery. These domains include mobile, PCs, home media (TVs), and in-car units devices. It is specified as middleware installed on a selection of operating systems (OSs) on current devices to enable the consistent and secure web application user experience. At the time of writing the supported OSs and device platforms include:
* Android 2.3.x
 tested with devices: Nexus S, Asus Transformer Prime, Samsung Galaxy S2, Sonyericsson Xperia Arc, Galaxy Note
* Microsoft Windows 7 SP, Windows 7, Windows XP
 tested with laptops: Vaio z11, Dell, Asus EeePC (1215N)
* Linux: Ubuntu 10.04 LTS, Slackware 13.1, 13.37, Mint, Fedora
 tested with devices: VMWare Player, Samsung, Asus EeePC (1215N)
 TV variants of Cocom Churchill 177, Acer Revo etc.
 vehicle variant of Pandaboard Rev. A3 with Ubuntu 11.10
* Mac OS X

The webinos platform includes not only a set of newly defined APIs to enhance current web application runtime environments, but also an overlay network architecture to enable the webinos specific features.

3 Document structure
--------------------

This suite of documents, D03.3, cover the architecture and required infrastructure and service components. They consist of 6 specifications, each of them is a self-inclusive specific document. The individual document structure can be found in each document.

-   High level specification
-   Personal Zone Proxy specification
-   Personal Zone Hub specification
-   Common and core specification
-   Applications specification
-   Informative specification

Webinos APIs and security are only mentioned briefly where appropriate in these documents to assist specifying the system architecture and components. They are specified in [WOS34] and [WOS36] in details respectively.
