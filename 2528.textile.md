Application DoS
---------------

### Intent

Harold has developed a webinos application he is very proud of. Unfortunately it is not receiving much attention because another app (which he believes to be inferior) is extremely popular. Harold decides to get rid of the competition, which he feels will be best for everyone: he gets the recognition he deserves and users get a better experience.

  Application blacklisted after negative reviews             Vulnerability     The application is given several negative reviews and warnings on app stores and social networks, putting it on a blacklist
  Application developer signing key compromised              Vulnerability     The application developer’s signing key is leaked to the attacker, perhaps due to it being embedded in a source file or another means.
  Application impossible to use                              Vulnerability     A webinos application is no longer usable
  Application signing key not checked                        Vulnerability     Update procedure does not check that the update signing key matches the original signing key
  Bad default policy                                         Vulnerability     The default webinos policy settings are too restrictive
  Bad user-selected policy                                   Vulnerability     The user has selected bad policy settings
  Badly configured policy                                    Vulnerability     The webinos policy settings are poorly chosen and the application is denied access to too many APIs
  Hosted application is attacked through content injection   Vulnerability     The application’s hosted components are attacked via a content injection attack, possibly XSS.
  JavaScript injection overwrites webinos.js                 Vulnerability     Injected javascript prevents the application from accessing PZP functionality by overwriting webinos.js
  JavaScript injection triggers security violation           Vulnerability     Injected javascript causes the application to trigger security warnings and get disconnected by the PZP or webinos runtime
  The Application is auto-updated by an attacker             Vulnerability     The application downloads an update automatically and installs it. However, the update was issued by an attacker rather than the application author
  Webinos backdoor                                           Vulnerability     The webinos platform is updated to specifically target this application and render it unusable

### Implementation

![]({width:1000px}Capture_Hidden_AnalyticsObstacleModel.jpg)

Peter is about to head to Berlin for a long weekend and decides to download the Berlin Gallery Guide from the Android app store. This application gives Peter a quick overview of art galleries in Berlin and allows him to take snaps and submit reviews about places visited. Before downloading the app, Peter checks what the application has access to. Additionally, before running the app for the first time, he also scans the application’s terms and conditions, briefly noting that the application captures information about time. Several days later, Peter is walking out of the Neue Nationalgalerie and submits some of his thoughts about the gallery as a review.

One month earlier, Jimmy was in the midst of a dilemma. His Berlin cafe guide was more successful than he thought, but he really wished that he had captured more analytics information; his new Berlin Gallery Guide might be just the opportunity he needs to get this data. While Peter really wants to capture information about location rather than time of review, this would mean re-drafting the privacy policy associated with the app to better reflect his intentions; this is both time consuming and, to his mind, unnecessary. "I mean" Jimmy thought, "I‘m the only person using the data, and I’m not going to abuse it so who really cares if I capture location data rather than time in my app. The PDP associated with the running application won’t notice the difference and, perhaps, maybe that means capturing this data is ok." Eventually, Jimmy convinces himself to reuse his previous privacy policy and configuration file entries related to permission, but change the Javascript code to store location data as context data rather than time.
Several weeks later, Jimmy feels vindicated by this decision as useful, fine-grained location data starts to arrive via his gallery guide app, including unauthorised location data arising about Peter’s visit to Neue Nationalgalerie.

Frankie is attempting to gain access to personal accounts on a range of popular websites, including email services and social networks. He intends to deface public records of some people (those he knows and has taken offense to) and maybe to expose a few people who he thinks are arrogant and deserve to be knocked down a peg or two. To do this, he is exploiting password recovery features and guessing commonly used "secret phrases" for openid accounts based on user names he knows, as well as some he has found on public forums. This resets user passwords and, as a consequence, means that the real users can’t authenticate against the OpenID providers. Unfortunately for the victims, this also means that they have lost access to their webinos personal zone administration interface. Later on, Frankie realises that some of his victims are running webinos, and he makes use of his access to their accounts to (in some cases) delete files and settings, and in other cases secretly add his own device to their personal zones.

Ethan has discovered that, invariably, webinos users have over-permissive convergence settings between devices used in the home and, with by altering the right settings, it is possible to change network service settings. This is especially useful given that some network providers, as part of their business model, allow users to change their bandwidth settings online via webinos. This is a boon for Ethan’s botnet business the convergence affordances allow him to easily increase the bandwidth available to his botnet clients.

A number of botnet client machines were running webinos, so he tried connecting to one of them and running a customised webinos web service client to discover any available webinos services. Sure enough, he discovered a text input service running on a mobile phone. Ethan was able to easily connect to this and manipulate the machine owner’s "use maximum bandwidth" setting. If he was lucky, the machine owner’s network provider would automatically increase this home’s bandwidth without the owner ever finding out.

As Alice was walking away from the bar with her drinks, she narrowly avoided dropping one of her glasses as man brushed past her. "Sorry", he mumbled as he walked briskly towards the toilets.

David devised a new scam which took advantage of the recent take-off of NFC based mobile payment, and the new webinos platform that could link different apps and devices together. The scam involved dropping a leech mobile phone into someone’s bag which contained a webinos enabled NFC phone. The leech would attempt to get the victim’s phone to join his personal zone which, David estimated, would not be too difficult. Once in place, David could then purchase things via NFC, while webinos routed the request to the victim’s NFC reader via the personal zone overlay network. David tinkered around with different devices, settings, and applications, and was quite surprised at how easy this scam appeared to be. Consequently, he would need to make the most use of this exploit quickly before other people got in on the act.

David’s plan was to find somewhere where there would be lots of young but unsuspecting people who might not notice something being put into their bags. David decided a nightclub on a Friday night would be a good bet. As David entered the club at shortly after midnight, he noticed a large group of people mingling near the bar. As he approached, he noticed a large women trying to carry multiple drinks with a hand-bag slung around her shoulder. Confidently, with his leech device in hand, David walked towards this woman.

Jimmy creates a legitimate and generally non-malicious web application which the end user installs. However, Jimmy designs it so that it accesses both webinos APIs and browser APIs, depending on what is available at the time. When the user turns off access to geolocation using webinos, Jimmy’s app automatically invokes the browser API instead which has already been authorised.

Justin gives David, the mechanic, his car keys so David can carry out his scheduled MOT.
David at the moment has not other customers, so he decides to fiddle with the in-car system.
The computer requires no authentication so he can enter and nose about navigation history. He realizes that the web browser is logged in a music service with fee. He listens to the music waiting for the next motorist coming.
After listening few songs, he uses his own webinos enabled smartphone to get the Justin’s personal zone device list via Justin’s PZH. From the list he selects the in-car system. When on the in-car system touch screen appears the confirmation dialog box, he taps on OK and the devices are now connected. David can exit from the car and access Justin’s music service form his own smartphone.
When Justin comes back to the parking, David disconnects the smartphone form the music service and from Justin’s personal zone and returns the car to its owner.

### Implementation

![]({width:1000px}Steal_webinos_SessionObstacleModel.jpg)

As a new source of income, Ethan has opened an account with an affiliate stock photo service. Ethan carries out some rudimentary google hacking to identify forums that might be open to stored XSS vulnerabilities. Eventually, Ethan finds a forum that is used by a Webinos enabled camera app that synchronises images with a cloud based photo sharing service.

Ethan develops an XSS/CSRF exploit by loading malicious code into the application’s blog page. On viewing the blog, the script obtains the Webinos session data and, via some local and external javascript and php, sends the session data to another site which uses the Webinos APIs, close a device’s session, re-opens the session to the device, obtains the images, and submits these to the affiliate stock photo service using the service providers web services API. Ethan realises the exploit might only work on certain devices, but he thinks that something is better than nothing…

Several days later, Justin is taking some snaps of some his friends at a bar using a recently downloaded camera application that syncs his images to the cloud based provider. On his way home, Justin browses the community developed help data in the application. Justin doesn’t realise that, by checking this help data, his photos are about to net Ethan some additional income.

Frankie creates an application which appears to be legitimate and only requests minimal permissions. Even if untrusted, many users are likely to install it and trust the webinos security framework to protect it once it has been uploaded to an app store. However, the application makes use of an unprotected communication interface with another application (which has access to many APIs) to read user data. Frankie makes sure that his app uploads this data to is servers…
