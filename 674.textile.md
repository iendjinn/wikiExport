Google Native Client
====================

Main features security and capability to adopt existing codebase to browser integration.

**Rationale**: Though W3C provide complete framework it lacks support for native client, using capability of client processing and memory capabilities.

Pros
----

-   Sandboxed technology provided allows code to run only in the code segments. Segments reduce memory areas you can access.
-   Design to run in the threaded environment, does not use ret instruction instead uses only pop and jmp.
-   Provide code to be written in html, javascript, and native code like c/c++ can also execute in NaCl environment.
-   Translation to native code happens through compiler provided by NaCl, a different GNU toolchain. Output file is having format .nexe and manifest is used to specify the number of processor application is going to use.
-   Code needs to be recompiled to run in the NaCl environment. All the existing code can be easily ported. An existing application running on desktop could run in web environment with just a compilation.
-   Uses restricted memory access as provided by x86 architecture. Instruction boundary is determined to find execution access of the code.
-   Modified compiler, assembler and loader increase in some cases runtime and in some case improves as it changes branch prediction rules.
-   Control behaviour of the code instead of specifying rules for developer
-   It is forbidden to mix text, data, overlap instruction, and dynamic code generation.
-   Pepper is the only way it provides access to browser, javascript, DOM and other resource of browser.
-   Auto Update is done based on information in manifest: http://code.google.com/chrome/extensions/autoupdate.html

Cons
----

-   Tightly coupled with ChromeOS and Chrome browser. Missing support in other browsers.
-   Challenges in 64 bit computing environment as it is without segment registers.

Lesson learned
--------------

The lack of beeing able to fully acces the underlying operating system disqualifies the usage of NaCl for webinos extensions. NaCl could be revisited, if performance critical functions have to be executed on the device.
