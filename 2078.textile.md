User ID and Data Management
===========================

Introduction and gap analysis
-----------------------------

According to the Specification in T3.1 (http://dev.webinos.org/redmine/projects/wp3-1/wiki/Spec_-_Authentication#Conceptual-Architecture),
<pre>
Within webinos, the authentication and identity issues need to be addressed at two distinct levels.

 1. Intra webinos authentication: the mechanisms via which users and devices are authenticated by the personal zone
 2. Extra webinos authentication: which describe some utility capability, where the personal zone hub can assist in the authentication against multiple external web applications and services, which are not necessarily webinos based.
</pre>

h2. Main differences: 3.1 specs vs 4.1 implementation

Referring to the above statement, in case of user authentication, at implementation there is no a clear distinction between Intra and Extra. In particular, the method to authenticate a user against a PZH is OpenID (which is external).
In case of device authentication, in intra case, we do authenticate devices by personal zone i.e. through device certificate.

h3. PZP Enrollment

For enrollment of new PZP in the zone is used an out-of-band channel. This consists in showing on the screen a QR code,the QR code is seen by the PZP (or a user sees the QR code sent by the PZH and manually insert it as PZP starting parameter) and then used to authorize PZP connections toward the PZH (http://dev.webinos.org/redmine/projects/wp4/wiki/PZP_Device_Enrolment).

h3. User authentication

<pre>
authentication is done in two steps: first the user is authenticated to at least one of his devices. Second the device communicates on behalf of the user identifying itself with its public key and its certificate.
</pre>

Actually the user is always authenticated to the PZH.

The Authentication API has been designed to provide authentication to the present device, exploiting mechanisms of the underlying OS. And devices communicates through a secure TLS exchange, based on certificates signed by the PZH (which acts as a Personal CA).
Authentication API is partially developed, for Linux and MacOSX, but was not integrated with PZH, it should be probably be integrated to mention we authenticate versus device using Authentication API.
Note: the sort of the authentication API is at the moment unclear and need some further investigation/scenarios development.

h3. Secure Storage

<pre>
Once the user is authenticated to a device, the device reveals access to the secure storage which keeps the private key in a protected environment.
</pre>

Secure storage has been investigated (http://dev.webinos.org/redmine/projects/wp4/wiki/Secure_Storage_Analysis) and an implementation proof of secure storage was provided for node 0.4. It was no longer developed so presently is in the status of early prototype. Where available, the system keyring is used to securely store attributes.

<pre>
The PZP is the only entity which can access the private key. The PZP uses the private key for mutual authentication within the zone and
across zones, and for integrity and confidentiality of communication between devices.
</pre>

Private keys are usually stored in plain in the file system, so easily accessible by any other entity on the same device. The use of keyring provide some encryption, and it requires authentication before being accesible. However, even if stored in the keyring, other authorized entities (outside webinos) can access it as well, since it’s not a specific PZP store.

h3. Routing

<pre>
When being messaged from devices on the open internet, the PZH acts like a DNS server, finding the most relevant end device application,
to which the incoming webinos messages should be routed.
</pre>

This is not strictly related to the authentication part, (possibly it falls under "Device, Application and Service Discovery")

<pre>
The PZP therefore intercepts and either directly deals with or forwards the authentication requests.
</pre>

It differs on the base of the authentication involved

* For User-Device authentication, using Phase 1 authentication API, the PZP is mediator between user and underlying OS
* For device-device authentication, the PZP-PZH or PZP-PZP interaction happens without user intervention (certificate exchange)

There is also a third-party OpenID authentication (at the PZH start) in which the PZH is the intermediary between user and third party (e.g. Google), but does not influence the process, apart relying on the third party authentication result.

h3. Synchronization

<pre>
The PZP synchronises key information with the PZH to allow it to perform its functions. This data includes
 * critical user identity information (to assist discovery) e.g. email, first name, last name etc
 * webinos PZH authentication tokens
 * extra webinos, 3rd party service authentication tokens (webinos Phase II)
 * identity tokens for trusted devices
 * identity tokens for trusted applications
 * identity tokens for trusted people
 * identity tokens for services that can be accessed from other people
 * all policy description files
 * context data
 * session data
 * application data
</pre>

In general, synchronization has been investigated (http://dev.webinos.org/redmine/projects/wp4/wiki/Synchronisation_Analysis) but not consistently implemented. The information exchange (with no specific synchronization requirement) among application involves **events**. In phase 1 there is no synchronization of authentication tokens (or policies) among Personal Zone devices

h3. User authentication level

Unimplemented, currently the system can distinguish only if authenticated or not.
There is no the required built-in secure storage (as mentioned above, the device keyring when available) and there is no the remote delete.

h3. User authentication notification

<pre>
event-based notification of user authentication each time the user authenticates without request by the PZP
</pre>

Not implemented a mandatory system authentication notification. An application can discretionary allow this with the Event API. Moreover, any pzp joining is do updated on PZH and its presence informed to corresponding pzp.
Note: It was not explicit (in the 3.1 specification) where user authentication should be notified, and for what use.

h3. User identifiers

<pre>
 For user visible identifiers we use:
 * the URI of the PZH, or
 * some piece of data (e.g. the user’s email address) that reliably
resolves (e.g. via Webfinger) to a single PZH URI.
</pre>

Presently, we use data derived from openID attributes to define a PZH name, and no webfinger mechanism is implemented.

h3. Differences in the sequence diagrams

h4. Technical Use Cases- Overview

-   The first time we have to authenticate to PZH (and obtain the QR code) before to start the PZP. The next time we can skip the authentication to PZH, but we have to start PZH and then the PZP, to avoid the PZP to run in virgin mode.
-   There is no data cache synch.

_Habib: Do we intend to allow PZP to join PZH as it is available as this would require some kind of heartbeat server. There is no requirement that’s why not implemented_

#### scenario 1

-   authentication and secure channel set-up are not separate steps. The PZP authenticates to PZH using PZH signed certificate establishing the TLS connection.
-   there is no data synchronization
-   about device list transmission and device status, it happens every time a PZP joins or leaves the zone (and the notification is broadcasted to each PZP component in the list)

#### scenario 2

same notes of scenario 1

#### scenario 3

The PZH does not mediate application authentication to Service Providers.

In the other sequence diagrams there some of the differences already highlighted above

### Virgin PZP

<pre>
If the PZH is not accessible, the PZP is accessible to other PZPs on the local network. The PZP MUST respond to other PZPs who intend to establish communication.
</pre>

PZP to PZP authentication has been impemented if the PZPs have been previously enrolled to the PZH. So, they use the PZH as Personal Zone CA, and use the PZH certificate as trusted certificate to authenticates/authorizes each other (note: Ziran has just implemented zeroconf implementation to facilitate pzp to pzp communicate). If there is no previous PZP enrollment, the item is on the agenda but not yet implemented.

Focus
-----

The implementation used some concepts deferred in the specification in the second phase that in some cases was needed in advance in implementation phase 1, as well as some not planned but not implemented in phase 1.

For example, the availability of a uniform identity inside the zone, as well as the single sign-on. An application can obtain a userID from the zone (distilling it from the OwnId string, composed of the user identifier, which is derived form openID attributes, the PZP name, and an app number) but this should be improved by offering a more direct way to get it.
_Habib agreed this should be added in WP3.4 standard apis_ at the moment could be achieved through functions like getPzpId() or getPzhId()

Thus, some work is further needed to conceptually integrate all the specification in a robust and coherent framework, and possibly some of the specs in 3.1 can be reworked in light of first phase implementation lessons.
