Threats and Attackers
---------------------

Which attacker personas are threat agents?
What are the threats?
Attack trees, perhaps?

potential threat agents:

-   Ethan or Frankie might attack a hosted webinos application, as students, to avoid a piece of coursework or a task they have to do
-   Gary might try to take down his company’s old webinos applications in retaliation, to cost them money
-   Gary might try to take down his old boss’s personal zone, in retaliation
-   Frankie gets dumped by his girlfriend, he retaliates by wrecking her devices / apps
-   Ethan or David try to earn some money by breaking lots of peoples’ webinos devices and then offering "fix" services
-   Ethan might be employed to take down a particular webinos application in order to help competitors
-   Irwin might know a DoS attack on a particular manufacturer’s version of webinos, and then release it in order to hurt their sales.
-   Frankie, or some other member of Anonymous might take down a web app "for the lulz" or for political reasons through webinos APIs.
-   Ethan might develop an exploit for webinos which causes the PZP to shut down or try to reconfigure itself. Such an attack could result in a DoS if unsuccessful.

Less security, more robustness from developers and users:

-   Jimmy might code a web app for a device which misuses APIs or the personal zone and causes it to malfunction
-   Jessica might misunderstand webinos authentication and therefore code an application which quickly becomes impossible to use as users cannot assert their identities
-   Jimmy’s app might use far too much battery power and cause the device to stop working

Potential attacks:

-   Denial of service to individual APIs.
    -   API Analysis needed - severity depends on the API in question.
    -   Over-polling, crashed underlying device driver or software. OS instability.
    -   Browser plugin intercepts calls to APIs
-   Denial of service to the personal zone
    -   Communication problem
    -   PZH problem - crashed, unauthenticated, busy
    -   PZP problem (any) - crashed, unauthenticated, misconfigured, loss of credentials
    -   Policy misconfiguration at any point
    -   Certificate expiry
    -   webinos-enabled virus / app, breaks security restrictions
    -   Hijack of authentication process / OpenID account, change of password
    -   "Account lockout" - too many failed authentication attempts might lock the account
-   Denial of service to content on devices
    -   Content deleted - an attack, possibly
    -   Policy denial
    -   PZP problem - crashed, unauthenticated, misconfigured, loss of credentials
-   Denial of service to the device
    -   webinos uses too much battery
    -   webinos is too slow
    -   a auto-starting app is too slow or infinitely loops
    -   webinos used to create a botnet - slowing down every device
-   Denial of service to applications (also via the PZP)
    -   bad update of an application ruins integrity
    -   application loads invalid remote data (remote attack)
    -   bad update process crashes webinos
    -   webinos.js overridden
    -   Browser plugin intercepts calls to APIs
    -   Personal zone problem
    -   Multi-use problem - being used elsewhere on the same zone and this overrides settings /c hanges?
    -   PZP failing
    -   WRT failing, or the communication between them failing
    -   policy misconfiguration
    -   Malware on the device renders it essentially unusable
    -   webinos-enabled malware / app, breaks security restrictions and renders apps unusable

Severity
--------

Mitigations and vulnerabilities
-------------------------------

How does our design mitigate this?

-   Loss of the PZH doesn’t prevent use of the PZPs
-   P2P options mean that the PZH is used relatively rarely except in remote scenarios
-   Applications can be installed locally
-   APIs contain over-use controls where appropriate
-   PZH designed for robustness (in theory) - should be hard to take down
-   Process isolation between widget renderer and PZP should make the PZP harder to attack
-   Restrictions on widget content (e.g. CSP) should make normal web attacks harder
-   Certificates given enormously long expiry dates
-   Standard update process to avoid update issues.
-   Reuse of web browser ought to add to robustness.
-   Exception policies to prevent access to too much content
-   Required notification UIs to alert users to excessive API usage

What have we left open?

-   Policy tools needed to avoid misconfiguration
-   OpenID out of scope, but clearly a weakness
-   Platform integrity out of scope.
-   We need to test for battery and performance issues.
-   Excessive traffic not monitored
