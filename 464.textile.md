Aims for Security and Privacy APIs
----------------------------------

The following requirements must be satisfied:

* PS-DEV-VisionMobile-11: Webinos applications SHALL have access to the standardized webinos user privacy preferences
 * PS-DEV-Oxford-56: Applications shall be aware of changes to policies and may alter their behaviour as a result
 * ID-DEV-POLITO-005: A webinos device may be able to provide Attestation of the webinos Platform.

However, the first two of these requirements have been moved to phase 2 of the implementation as the security architecture is further clarified.

In addition, various requirements (PS-USR-Oxford-103, PS-USR-Oxford-26) require users to authenticate through device-specific capabilities. Therefore, an authentication API has been specified.

Aims for Security and Privacy APIs in phase 2
---------------------------------------------

The following proposals will be investigated in phase 2 of the webinos platform:

-   Expose user privacy preferences to applications, including data retention policies and access control.
    -   Provide applications with the ability to query the _obligations_ they will be under should they use a particular data item.
    -   Provide applications with the ability to query their own permissions - what have they been granted access to.
-   Expose device security capabilities
    -   Statements about whether the device can provide certain security features and to what level of assurance is provided. The main challenge with implementing this would be validating the results.
    -   These features might include (a) authentication methods, (b) attestation, Â© secure storage, (d) isolated execution, (e) auditing and logging, (f) event reporting / monitoring of platform state, (g) credentials for keys held in the platform & revocation lists.
-   Depending on future use cases and requirements, webinos may choose to expose certain cryptography APIs to applications.
-   Remote management APIs, perhaps like the "Android Device Admin API":http://developer.android.com/guide/topics/admin/device-admin.html

Existing standards
------------------

The following APIs for security (e.g. cryptography and authentication) and for attestation exist.

-   APIs for Cryptography and transport sessions
    -   "javax.crypto for cryptography":http://developer.android.com/reference/javax/crypto/package-summary.html
    -   "javax.crypto.interface for Diffie-Hellman":http://developer.android.com/reference/javax/crypto/interfaces/package-summary.html
    -   "javax.crypto.spec for specification of crypto-parameters (e.g., the key)":http://developer.android.com/reference/javax/crypto/spec/package-summary.html
    -   "java.net.ssl for SSL/TLS":http://developer.android.com/reference/javax/net/ssl/package-summary.html
-   APIs for authentication
    -   "java.security.auth for authentication credential management":http://developer.android.com/reference/javax/net/ssl/package-summary.html
-   APIs for policy management
    -   "android.app.admin to manage device policies":http://developer.android.com/reference/javax/net/ssl/package-summary.html
-   APIs for DRM
    -   "android.drm for Digital Rights management":http://developer.android.com/reference/android/drm/package-summary.html
-   Device status and attestation
    -   "WAC device status API":http://specs.wacapps.net/wac2_0/feb2011/deviceapis/devicestatus.html as currently suggested in [[HW_Resource_APIs]].
    -   Trusted Computing Group "Trusted Software Stack":http://www.trustedcomputinggroup.org/resources/tcg_software_stack_tss_specification .
-   Secure coding APIs
    -   "OWASP ESAPI":http://www.owasp.org/index.php/ESAPI#tab=Downloads - useful for input validation, credit card validation, etc.

APIs for which no existing standards/implementations exist
----------------------------------------------------------

### Attestation API

**Description:** The purpose of this API is to provide a secure means to query the device to find out the identity and integrity of running software. The example use case is "Trusted Computing Mobile Reference Architecture":http://www.trustedcomputinggroup.org/resources/mobile_phone_work_group_mobile_reference_architecture . However, this is aimed at a lower layer than webinos. The aim of the attestation API is simply to allow access to existing functionality.
**Requirement/architectural reference:** ID-DEV-POLITO-005, ID-DEV-POLITO-006, ID-DEV-POLITO-007, ID-DEV-POLITO-008
**Phase:** 1
**Webinos responsible/editor:** John Lyle
|**High level Requirement**|**Notes**|
| This API shall be capable of exposing basic TCG attestation capabilities ||
| This API shall not rely upon a specific hardware implementation ||
| This API shall provide applications with the ability to fetch authenticated data about the runtime state of the platform | |

### Authentication API

**Description:** Provides information to applications about the current authentication status of users, as well as allowing applications to request re-authentication..
**Requirement/architectural reference:** PS-USR-Oxford-103, PS-USR-Oxford-26
**Phase:** 1
**Webinos responsible/editor:** John Lyle
|**High level Requirement**|**Notes**|
| This API shall allow applications to request that the user authenticate to the device ||
| This API shall allow applications to find out when and how the user last authenticated ||
| This API shall not expose identity information about the user | |
