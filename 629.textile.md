Introduction
============

A friendly introduction to the subject area

-   one
-   two
    -   three

1.  one
2.  two
    1.  three

The introduction should highlight webinos innovations, since reviewers and other readers will be asking that question very early on.

Scope
=====

Whatâ€™s in scope
---------------

Precise statements of what we are considering in this section

Whats out of scope
------------------

Explicit statement of things we are holding out of scope, including items we are deferring to phase 2.

Review of State of the Art
==========================

Document and evaluate the existing technologies in this space

Recommendations from state of the art
=====================================

Make some conclusions on what aspects of state of the art we can use

Conceptual Architecture
=======================

[[webinos architecture]]

Technical Use Cases
===================

Discrete technical use cases that unfold the requirements one by one.

Sequence diagram analysis
-------------------------

Sequence diagram analysis that reconciles the conceptual architecture with the user cases, eliciting issues as we go

Formal Specification
====================

This section is where we get into formal specification and architecture

NOTE: when it comes to formal specification the distinctions between the subject areas may collapse

UML components analysis
-----------------------

Detail the specifics of the individual components required, using UML and accompanying prose.

UML sequence analysis
---------------------

Using sequence and state diagrams describe the behaviour of the system
and define and algorithmic elements

Functional and non functional requirements
------------------------------------------

A holding place for any formal requirements (not easily testable or provably interoperable) that are not part of the specification.

Protocol definitions
--------------------

Define any protocols that must exist between elements - and data structures.

may be done be reference to pre-existing specs - or create new ones.

JavaScript APIs
---------------

WebIDL definitions of 3rd party accessible functionality

<pre><code class="javascript">

function Login(theUserName, thePassword)
{
 //an option for the application to explicitly log in gathering credentials from data files or user interface

//question - should this be allowed? does it introduce security issues
}

function IsUserIdentified()
{
 //returns a bool - whether the runtime has logged in or not
 //many possible credential systems are possible here
}

function GetUserData(theKey)
{
 //returns theValue - key value pairs associated with the user
 //access to this info is via the policy
}

function GetToken()
{
 //returns a cyptographic token that represents the user
 //some how this must reconcile with discovery and messaging
}

</code></pre>

Dependencies on other components
--------------------------------

identify interface points to other components:

e.g. ID -> Policy points

Implementation Architecture
---------------------------

Start to look at actual **implementation** issues for code - this does not presume interopatbiity and will consider platform specific issues
