Browser plug-in extension handling
==================================

Enhances capability of the webinos runtime to enable the access to uncommon and unique device features.

The Browser plug-ins / extension handling unit **provides the mechanism to manage non-webinos client side software components**, which enhances the functionality of the webinos runtime and **enables the execution of this software artifacts in a secure manner**.

Parts to be specified
---------------------

In the browser plug-in / extension handling we need to specify the following:

|**description**|**target audience**|**priority**|**comments**|
|[[API for accessing an extension inside an application]]|app developer|high|Accroding to REQ LC-DWP-ISMB-009 must be useable in the same way as other device features|
|[[API/Interfaces for integrating the extensions into the webinos runtime]]|extension developer/provider |high||
|[[Datascheme for packaging an extensions]]|extension developer/provider|high|According to REQ LC-3RD-ISMB-106 must be packaged as similar as possible to applications|

  Identification by browser about plug-in should have description about. This input needs to come from the identification about syntax and format.                                        TBD.
  Registering of plug-ins: MIME type, browser detection (what types to include), PFS2 search API                                                                                          tbd.

|CAP-DWB-FHG-002|The webinos runtime SHOULD allow access to non-webinos APIs to device features||
|PS-DWP-ISMB-202|The Webinos runtime MUST ensure that an application does not access device features, extensions and content other than those associated to it.||
|LC-DEV-ISMB-003|An application MUST be associated with required and optional APIs it MAY use, as well as their minimum/supported versions. ||
|LC-ASP-ISMB-112|It SHALL be possible to define meta-packages containing a collection of applications and/or extensions. ||
|LC-DWP-ISMB-009|Extensions SHALL be treated in a way that is similar and consistent with standard device features.||
|LC-3RD-ISMB-106|Extensions SHALL be packaged in a way that is as similar as possible to applications.||
|LC-3RD-ISMB-107|An Extension that contains platform-specific code MUST be associated with the supported platform(s).||
