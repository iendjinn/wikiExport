Which "frozen" revisions of Webinos APIs do we need?
------------------------------------------------------

See mail https://listen.fokus.fraunhofer.de/sympa/arc/webinos-wp3-ml/2012-05/msg00064.html.

When the specifications has been aligned with what we really implemented in task 4.1 we will continue the work to improve specifications, align with progress in W3C and elsewhere etc. The question is if we should create a revision of the API specification repository after all APIs have been aligned with what we really implemented in task 4.1. The reason for this would be to have a version available to developers that really reflects the 4.1 implementation as the APIs from task 3.2 may not be 100% correct compared to the implementation.

The conclusion was that we should decide that when we see the result of changes needed on specifications to be aligned with task 4.1 implementation at http://dev.webinos.org/redmine/projects/t3-4/wiki/API_specification_alignment_with_task_41_API_implementations.

Update all task 3.2 APIs according to latest W3C widl-specification.
--------------------------------------------------------------------

-   Dom has migrated 8 APIs, http://dev.webinos.org/specifications/new/.

-   widlproc executables are in place for Linux and Mac users meaning it is possible for those users to generate API specifications that fullfill the latest W3C widl-specification. Paddy is working on widlproc for Windows.

API specification alignment with task 4.1 API implementations and further work on APIs
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

See http://dev.webinos.org/redmine/projects/t3-4/wiki/API_specification_alignment_with_task_41_API_implementations

-   Context API: Christos explained this API. Generally the current API specification is not detailed enough, it is too generic so the task 4.1 implementation had to detailj things that was not stated in the specification. "AP Christos to coordinate with Dieter on further work with the Context API":http://dev.webinos.org/redmine/issues/888

-   Events API: Christian to check with Andre.

-   AppLauncher API: Christian checks with Andre if he could take ownership.

-   Messaging API: "AP Stefano to provide feedback on implementation":http://dev.webinos.org/redmine/issues/889

-   NFC API: Stefano owner. "AP to document feedback on implementation and proposed further work":http://dev.webinos.org/redmine/issues/890

-   Payment API: Christian is owner of this API and has provided implementation feedback and other suggestions for this API at the wiki. Further work on the APi is much related to the webinos architecture so this is a joint effort with task 3.3. It also might be good to talk to Dave as he has been prototyping payment using NFC and a Payment API.

-   Sensors API: Claes owner and implementation feedback and other suggestions for this API is stated at the wiki. There is currently discussions going on in W3C on Sensor APIs. A set of simple sensor specific APIs is proposed. These APIs typically provide access to in-device sensors such as proximity and ambient light sensors. However, we also must consider external sensors as we have use cases for accessing a sensor in another device, for example getting the location from another device. In addition we must be able to access typical "not-in-device" sensors such as pulse meters (for which we had a demo at MWC). So discovery is important and the current webinos Sensor API leverages the webinos Discovery API. Another option is to create sensor APIs based on Web Intents discovery. "Action Claes to define how to take the Sensor API further considering W3C activities on Sensor APIs":http://dev.webinos.org/redmine/issues/885.

-   Discovery API: Alexander implemented this in task 4.1 so there is an "action on him to state deviations in the implementation compared to the specification and state other suggestions for further work on this API based on implementation experiences":http://dev.webinos.org/redmine/issues/883. Ziran states that there are two parts of the discovery implementation in task 4.1:
    -   Service Discovery coupled with RPC (assume this implements webinos Service Discovery API)
    -   Device Discovery exposed to web developers (we have no API specification for this?)
        Claes requested documentation on the current discovery implementation to get a better understanding on how we should progress on discovery and Ziran got an "action to briefly document current discovery API implementation done in task 4.1":http://dev.webinos.org/redmine/issues/891.
        Another question is potential alignment of this API with ongoing standardization in W3C or elsewhere. We have to consider Web Intents, see for example 8.1 wiki on this, http://dev.webinos.org/redmine/projects/wp8-1/wiki/Web_Intents and maybe also Opera/CableLabs proposal, http://people.opera.com/richt/release/specs/discovery/Overview.html.

-   TV API: Martin owner and has provided suggestions for improvements.

-   User profile API. Ronny owner and he has promised to come back with feedback at the end of week 19, i.e. this week.

-   Vehicle API: Simon owner. No more suggestions in addition to what is already stated at the wiki.

-   Widget API: Christian to talk to Andre. There are "feedback from Dom":http://dev.webinos.org/redmine/issues/878 based on his work with migrating this API to the latest widl-specification. Who should be owner of further work on this API, Paul or Paddy?

-   "Wrapper APIs" based on referred APIs from W3C and WAC. Assuming we should continue to use wrappers the best approach would be to align the webinos wrappers with the latest version of the referred original specification from W3C or WAC. For the Contacts API Christian is doing this. For the Media Capture API nothing should be done as the proposal is that it should be superseeded by the new getUserMedia API. Actions for other APIs to be defined.

Aligning Webinos APIs with latest W3C and other standards
---------------------------------------------------------

Please review and provide any other suggestions on this matter at this wiki page: "Aligning Webinos APIs with latest W3C and other standards":http://dev.webinos.org/redmine/projects/t3-4/wiki/Aligning_Webinos_APIs_with_latest_W3C_standards.

Other
-----

Everyone to execute their Actions stated at http://dev.webinos.org/redmine/projects/t3-4/issues

Next meeting moved to Wednesday May 16 at 11.00 as May 17 is a public holiday in several European countries (and Hans, an extremely important day in Norway! :-) )
