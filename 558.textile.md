Scope Discussion
================

Clearly webinos cannot solve all security and privacy issues related to web apps, browsers and device APIs. As a result, there is a need to define some problems as "out of scope"

This page is designed to clarify our stance on these problems. When a specific threat is queried, we should have a note on this page of whether it is:

-   Definitely a threat Webinos aims to mitigate
-   A threat to consider in the second iteration
-   Out of scope of Webinos

In reality, I expect the majority of the middle group will become part of the bottom group. Ideally, all threats in the bottom group should have some justification or story about them to clarify _why_ they are not being handled in Webinos.

Security and privacy threats _definitely within scope of the first iteration_
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Security and privacy threats not in scope of the first iteration, but to be considered in the second
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Security and privacy threats not in scope of webinos at all
-----------------------------------------------------------
