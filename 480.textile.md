Extending the browser
=====================

This is part of work on realizing the [[Overlay networking model]].

_Device discovery in the browser using a cross browser plugin_

![](discovery.jpg)

After an investigation of zero conf, USB and Bluetooth, I am confident we will need binary browser extensions as adapter modules for various classes of device drivers. In some cases these will need to be dynamically installed when the driver is specific to a given device. The binary adapter module exposes a low level interface to the corresponding JavaScript module that in turn exposes the high level interface used by web developers.

This is definitely do able on open Linux platforms, but how easy is it to install new versions of the browser and aforesaid binary modules in Android phones, in TVs and car infotainment systems? If that proves problematic we will need to find ways to emulate those devices for demo purposes whilst we experiment and refine the APIs through practical experience. This also avoids the challenge of finding a sufficient number of suitable TVs and car infotainment systems to play with. Demo’s on the real devices could then come at a later stage when the software and APIs have stabilized.

As an example of how this would work, I can imagine making a laptop computer emulate a remote display device when it comes to a demo where a mobile phone is used to send a (reference to a) movie to a display.

When you say "plugins" what exactly do you mean? I suspect that web page plugins using the Netscape API may not be ideal for our purposes, and that we should look at alternative ways to add low level APIs to browsers. See e.g.

-   http://lists.macosforge.org/pipermail/webkit-dev/2009-January/006415.html

The need to call low level device drivers makes it likely that we will need native code modules, which is a pain, but certainly do able for research purposes. Google has some interesting work on portable native code. See

-   http://www.chromium.org/nativeclient

which provides a good background on extending webkit via plugins, but the native client mechanism they propose involves using a cross platform API, something we can’t restrict ourselves to when it comes to interfacing to a variety of low level device drivers.

Firefox has a neat way (js-types) to call native code libraries from scripts, see:

-   http://blog.mozilla.com/dwitte/2010/03/12/extension-authors-browser-hackers-meet-js-ctypes/

This is very attractive for trusted JavaScript code running as a browser extension. It might be worth investigating how much work it would be to get this working with webkit.

Browser extensions
------------------

Google Chrome Extensions are small software programs that can modify and enhance the functionality of the Chrome browser. You write them using web technologies such as HTML, JavaScript, and CSS. You can also use the extension system to build packaged apps, a downloadable kind of installable web app.

-   http://code.google.com/chrome/extensions/index.html

Firefox add ons are more flexible and run scripts with full privileges. You also get a very extensive set of APIs exposed by the browser. Chrome extensions run in a separate sandbox with restricted privileges. Some opinions on the differences between the two approaches are given in:

-   "Chrome extensions vs Firefox add ons":http://www.searchenginejournal.com/firefox-addons-google-chrome/15771/
-   "Google Chrome Extensions vs Firefox Add-ons: Head to Head Comparison":http://techie-buzz.com/featured/google-chrome-extensions-vs-firefox-addons.html

Security for extensions
-----------------------

The low level APIs exposed by native code extensions should be restricted to trusted JavaScript modules. How is this possible? In Firefox, browser add ons run scripts with elevated privileges, but restrict communication between trusted scripts in add ons, and untrusted scripts in web pages. The add on can manipulate the DOM of a web page, and set event listeners on DOM nodes. This allows the add on to listen for events raised by web page scripts. The add on can also call the browser API functions exposed the window and document objects. The add on can’t call functions in the web page script, nor can it access properties of objects in web pages scripts.

Ideally, we would be able to add new methods to existing web page objects (window, document, navigator) that allow page scripts to access webinos capabilities. As far as I know there is no existing mechanism for extending webkit with trusted JavaScript code short of modifying the browser code base. One approach would be to use untrusted scripts to load a plugin and encapsulate the communication with the plugin. This would make use of the cross browser NPAPI extensions, see:

-   "Scripting plugins":https://developer.mozilla.org/en/Gecko_Plugin_API_Reference/Scripting_plugins

This would involve writing the trusted code in C or C+*. In principle, it might be possible to define a single plugin that runs a scripting engine ("Google V8":http://code.google.com/p/v8/) and which loads native libraries dynamically with js-types as a bridge. This seems worth investigating!

h2. Securing the browser and requesting privileges

We need to look at the ideas being floated by Mozilla and others for installed web apps to request extra privileges. This is expected to lead to a new W3C Working Group within a few months from now. Ideally the browser should run in a locked down mode that is more secure than is the default for web pages today (e.g. no eval, constrained innerHTML), and to then make a single request for a list of privileges:

* http://dougt.org/wordpress/2011/03/device-api-permission-management/
* http://groups.google.com/group/mozilla-labs/browse_thread/thread/e592b27e54b7f857
* http://dev.w3.org/2009/dap/docs/feat-perms/feat-perms.html

Some challenges include:

* requesting multiple privileges with a single request so that the user doesn’t have to deal with a succession of dialog boxes
* how to justify the request to the user being asked to grant the privileges, starting with a text string and a link to more information
* white and black lists for well behaved and evil applications - which leads on to the role of trust delegation for improved usability, and whether crowd based recommendations are practical

We should think how to work together with Mozilla, Google and others on a joint proposal as this is likely to have greater chance of widespread adoption than doing something in isolation.

h2. Using XMLHttpRequest with a local server

One way to extend the browser is with an untrusted JavaScript library (part of the web page) that communicates with a local HTTP server via XMLHttpRequest. Normally, the browser will disallow such requests as the local domain and the web page domain will differ violating the same-origin policy. A work around is the Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) mechanism. This involves the local HTTP server adding a response header listing the set of origins that are permitted to read that information using a web browser.

* [1] "HTTP access control":https://developer.mozilla.org/En/HTTP_Access_Control
* [2] "Cross-Origin Resource Sharing Specification":http://www.w3.org/TR/cors/

Does CORS allow you to specify a wild card for the origin? If not we will have scaling problems with the number of origins to list.
_-> Wildcards are possible: "In this case, the server responds with a Access-Control-Allow-Origin: * which means that the resource can be accessed by any domain in a cross-site manner"[1]_

h2. Webinos Platform Plugin

I have begun work on an NPAPI/NPRuntime based plugin that should work across browsers when compiled for the OS platform. See the zip file below for a functioning scriptable plugin. The challenge is to now demonstrate ways to support asynchronous communication for tasks lasting for several seconds as discovery isn’t always an instant process. There is apparently a way to proxy calls from a worker thread to the main UI thread.

I have also demonstrated the means to wrap the V8 scripting engine in a C*+ program and to load and execute a script. I am having difficulties in getting the script to call out to functions exposed by the C++ code. This too shouldn’t be too hard to resolve. We can then explore the practical implications of directly invoking low level discovery and device drivers to scripts from native code in a plugin, or whether we will be better off wrapping low level interfaces in scripts executed inside the plugin in a trusted environment.

### Device Discovery using multicast DNS

This is a version of the plugin using avahi for discovering services over multicast DNS (mDNS). It scans the local network for three seconds in a worker thread and calls back to a method on an object passed to the plugin. The service types are presented in human friendly form along with the device name, and the IP address and port. Note that mDNS isn’t supported by all devices, e.g. it doesn’t find my Belkin ADSL modem and wifi access point. I next plan to work on allowing web page scripts to advertise services, and to enable such scripts to listen for service requests from other devices.

### Device Discovery using SSDP

This uses multicast and unicast UDP packets plus TCP for retrieving device descriptions in XML. This can be slow as not all devices respond to the multicast search probe, so you need to wait for periodic multicast notifications.

### Device Discovery using SLP

This uses libslp (OpenSLP).

### Device Discovery using Bluetooth

This uses the Bluez library together with info on device types coded in JavaScript.

### Device Discovery using USB

This is fast and involves a scan of the Linux device directories. A database is used to look up the device description given the vendor id and product id.

s. I already know how to get the plugin to dynamically load native libraries and expect to explore that as a way to extend the browser without having to install a new plugin and restart the browser.
