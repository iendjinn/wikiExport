Authentication API
------------------

### Overview of API

http://dev.webinos.org/specifications/new/authentication.html

Provides information to applications about the current authentication status of users, based on their authentication to the local device. This API may also be used within webinos to ask the runtime to authenticate the user.

### Threats

#### API-Specific threats and misuse cases

1.  This API could be used to monitor the current state of the user. e.g., requesting an authentication might show that the end user is present.
2.  Authentication method and Last Auth Time could be used for fingerprinting the user.
3.  If this is mapped to device authentication, users could be inundated with authentication requests. It also might confuse them into clicking-through or automatically entering passwords when prompted. This would be a particularly big problem if this password/code is reused on other systems.
4.  The authentication prompt could be spoofed by an application.

#### Threats based on remote invocation of this API from another device

1.  Remote invocation could be misused to monitor the user’s activity - e.g., to work out whether the user was active on the device.
2.  Misuse of authentication - if all authentication requests are delegated to a device which does not support (or only weakly supports) the Authentication API, this might be unexpectedly weak or strong.

#### Implementation threats and possible attacks

1.  The current implementation means that authentication applies to all apps at once - a user authenticating in one App will automatically be authenticated for others. This may be confusing if the API is misused as authorisation.

#### Threats to apps and developers using this API (E.g. Jimmy and Jessica)

1.  The use of this API could create false expectations for developers. It is meant to be used to re-assert the users identity as the owner of the PZP in question. However, it is not supposed to be a strong authentication statement, as the method will be device-specific. Developers must be aware that it is weak, and may not correlate with the current user precisely. It should not be used to protect high-value or high-risk events.
2.  Similarly, authentication is not necessarily authentication for the current action - a user may have authenticated for another reason. It should not be confused with authorisation.
3.  Authentication time-outs and delays are platform-specific, and developers need to be aware that they should check the ‘lastAuthTime’ parameter to see how fresh it is.

#### Threats to device manufacturers, operators, other stakeholders

### Mitigations

1.  Provide examples for the correct scenarios in which the API should be used. Make sure that authentication is not confused with authorisation. Consider adding authorisation methods to this API.
2.  Allow plausible deny-ability - callbacks should trigger after timeouts of random periods (within certain limits) to avoid user monitoring.
3.  Secure UI - make sure the webinos prompt is not spoofable.
4.  Do not make use of the authentication credentials in any way.
5.  Make sure that authentication API implementations do not allow for excessive querying of the user. Authentication caching is required.
6.  Make explicit which application is asking for authentication when authentication is requested.

### Recommended default policy rules for applications

  ------------- ------------------------------------------------------
  _.Code   _.Type
  B-A           Browser-based, authenticated via TLS certificates
  W-R           Widget, authenticated using a recognised certificate
  W-U           Widget, unrecognised
  ------------- ------------------------------------------------------

  ------------ ------------ ------------ ----------------------------------- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- -- -- --- -- ------------------------------------- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- -----------------------------------------------------------------
  _.B-A   _.W-R   _.W-U   _.Policy                       _.Explanation (Widgets)                                                                                                                             _.Explanation (Browser Apps)                                                                                               x      Silently allow                        2. Applications will be granted access to this API without user consent being required. This can only be modified using a policy editor.
  x                         x            Default allow (install time)        Widgets will need user consent at install time, but users will expect to allow it (the tick-box will automatically be filled in).                        Webpages will prompt for consent (Yes / No / Always) at runtime, this can be just a warning rather than a prompt
                                         Default ask at runtime (one-time)   Widgets will require one-off user consent at runtime. This fact will be visible & modifiable at install time.                                            Webpages will prompt for consent (Yes / No / Always) at runtime, but the PZP will remember the setting.                                Default ask at runtime (every time)   Widgets will require user consent at runtime, every time. This fact will be visible & modifiable at install time.
                                         Default deny (install time)         Widgets will require user consent at install time, but users will expect NOT to allow it (the tick-box will automatically be empty).                     Webpages will display a short notification at first-use saying that access was denied, with a button to change settings
                                         Silently deny                       2. Applications will not be granted access to this API, and users will not be asked at install time. This can only be modified using a policy editor.
