UPnP Information
================

Introduction
------------

In this document, analysis of UPnP is done in retrospective of webinos device and service discovery.

UPnP is a ISO standard for home network that supports automatic configuration i.e. network should be self configurable. It is a protocol based approach and no device drivers are involved. Protocol used are HTTP, TPC/UDP, SOAP, and SSDP. Communication is between controllers/control points and controlled services. One or more services are combined to form a device. Controlled devices handles requests from control point.

Following topics are covered:
# Use Cases
# Technical Description
# Gap Analysis based on requirements
# Conclusion

Inputs of this analysis has been used in Device & Service Architecture.

Use Cases
---------

-   User enables WiFi device in his home. He has multiple devices TV, Mobile Phone, Automotive standing in his Garage, PC, Laptop. He wants to see pictures from his PC on to the TV. He requires ZeroConf environment which allows device to communicate with each other without user intervention.

-   User wants to have synchronization between his mobile phone and the automotive system. So when he goes in his car, his calendar data is synced automatically and navigation system in car can guide the user.

Technical Description
---------------------

Bluetooth or USB can be extended via bridging, to run non-IP protocols when cost, technology or legacy prevents media or devices attached to it from running IP.

A more concise introduction on UPnP: http://dev.webinos.org/redmine/projects/wp2-3/wiki/UPnP_and_DLNA#UPnP-Technology-Analysis.

UPnP comprises of Discovery, Description, Control, Event, and Presentation. Before Discovery can be resolved it needs addressing. Below the mechanism used are described.

### Addressing:

IP address is resolved by sending DHCP Discover message and if DHCP Offer is received, no AUTO address is required. If not, AUTO address mechanism is used to get IP address.

-   A managed network is one having DHCP server, IP addressing is assigned through DHCP. If domain name is procured then it is to be used or IP address to be used for further communication.
-   If no DHCP servers are available then AUTO address is used, address in range of 169.254/16 range is used. AUTO IP address is randomized process, which is tested to avoid collision, if collision happens then a new address is assigned. Testing is done by sending ARP probe request. It is responsibility of the control point to resolve address conflict if found.
-   Devices can be referenced by name too but has to be registered with DNS.

In relation to webinos, it needs mechanism described like above to resolve IP address. AUTO IP is mechanism that can be used when no IP address could be assigned.

### Discovery:

Allow devices to advertise its services to control points and allows control point to search for devices. Result of discovery is device type, device unique identifier, and URL for obtaining device description. Search and advertise are multicast messages, while request/response between control point and device are unicast messages. If IP address or services are changed it is responsibility of device to advertise the changed IP address. Each device, embedded device and service offered by each device should be advertise via multicast. Because of the nature of the UDP, advertisement message are sent multiple times and CACHE CONTROL controls the expiry time of advertisement.

Discovery is done using SSDP (Simpler Service Discovery Protocol), it is based on HTTP protocol 1.1. It is a simple protocol which comprises of start line and list of message headers.

SSDP Start line:
* NOTIFY * HTTP/1.1 rn
* M-SEARCH * HTTP/1.1 rn
* HTTP/1.1 200 OK rn

Message header appear in form of token.domainame e.g. phone.samsung.com: Galaxy. It includes following fields:
* Notification type header field:
**** urn:schemas-upnp-org:device:deviceType:ver (Device type that are registered with UPnP forum)
**** urn:schemas-upnp-org:service:serviceType:ver (Service Type that are registered with UPnP forum)
**** urn:domain-name:device:deviceType:ver (Unregistered device can use the domain name of the device vendor)
**** urn:domain-name:service:serviceType:ver (same as above)
**** upnp:rootdevice (only to be used once for the main device)
**** device-UUID (specifies UUID)
* USN Composite identifier
* LOCATION (URL for fetching more information about the device)
* CACHE-CONTROL (Duration of advertisement)
* Different SSDP message: ssdp:alive, ssdp:byebye, ssdp:update, ssdp:discover (Describes different device activities)

Described mechanism above gives overview of SSDP, it can be used in webinos to find about other device and learn about its features.

Input needed from ID Management is mechanism for fetching UUID and how to specify URL.

### Description

Uses pointer from above step, discovery, to find details about the device. The description of device is in form of XML.

It is divided into two logical parts: device description that describes physical and logical containers. Service description describes capabilities exposed by the device.

Device description is done by device manufacturer. Service description includes information about list of commands and parameters for each command. It also includes variables which define state of service. The basis of this step results in control, event mechanism, and presentation activities of UPnP.

Description part of UPnP defines format which can be directly adapted in webinos system. Only consideration should be the format of the schema has to be adaptable for other activities in webinos such as event management, which will get input from this schema about the events and variables that device can support.

### Control

Based on description, control point can send message to control URL of the services. The return is the action specific values. State variables describe run time state of the services.

The control messages are sent using mandatory tags of SOAP. It makes use of Envelope and Body messages of SOAP.

The control messages should be probably handled by the solution what event managements uses. This mechanism may not be relevant for webinos.

### Eventing

Description of service lists the action (methods) and list of variables that describes the state of services at run time. When the service is changed it is sent to the subscribed entities or it could be multicast which is done via UDP and is unreliable. A secure way is to use unicast event subscription mechanism that should be used.
It makes use of GENA (Generic Event Notification architecture), to handle event mechanism.

The event messages should be probably handled by the solution what event managements uses.

### Presentation

This layer provides the URL that user can use in the browser to control devices.

Probably this could be used but how it fits in the architecture is not clear.

Comparison Analysis
-------------------

|Technologies|Implementation|Integrate with Browser|Network Structure|
|UPnP|http://pupnp.sourceforge.net/, http://sourceforge.net/projects/platinum/files/platinum/ ,
http://www.gupnp.org/downloads/gupnp-0.15.1|Yes, support in Android and iPhone, http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/upnp-browser/id334692579?mt=8, Presentation interface of UPnP can be controlled via browser|Yes, control point required but can be implemented on same device|

Gap Analysis
------------

|Requirements|GAP|Proposal Solutions|
|DA-DEV-SEMC-001|UPnP provides mechanism for updating device availability, if device is off its advertisement expires automatically. Device updates about its on/off state. During discovery and description, all the information between device and control point are shared, these provides information about the services and the control variable that show the runtime state of the device.|It is comprehensive solution that includes not only device and service discovery but way to control and send/receive events from devices. Proposed solution could be to have something similar to managed and unmanaged network solution suggested by Victor|
|DA-DEV-SEMC-002|Updates about the new service availability is done by sending the multicast advertisement message. ||
|DA-DEV-SEMC-003|Advertisement of new service includes information about the service URL| Extend this functionality to include the information about the location to install new software|
|DA-USR-FHG-002|UPnP provides device type and unique identifier| Need to translate unique identifier to human readable form|
|DA-DEV-ISMB-004|Sensors and actuators can be communicated, if they support UPnP mechanism and are advertised then the services offered can be available to the webinos platform||
|DA-DEV-ISMB-006||There is no mechanism currently and should be extended to include user and device information to use in authentication stage.|

Rest of requirements are based on application discovery and are not addressed in this topic. Though a question is should we include application discovery as part of service discovery? Then we would need to define XML schema for it.

Conclusion
----------

UPnP architecture as whole is not relevant except discovery and descriptions. Control, events, and presentation stages of UPnP mechanism might be not needed as it will be handled differently in webinos system.

UPnP supports ZeroConf but there is a difference in approach by Apple and Microsoft. Apple approach is based on Multicast DNS and DNS Query which is supported in Bonjour and Avahi. Bonjour approach eliminates need for a control point and has easier IP address resolve mechanism in form of mDNS.

Since overall mechanism is same, a more subtle approach could be to use both, as there are device based on both mechanism it will be easier to find more devices and communicate with them.
