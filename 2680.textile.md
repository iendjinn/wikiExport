Status Update - Turin 2013
==========================

Whatâ€™s happening with T3.5?
---------------------------

-   Very little time or effort spent in the last six months
-   Most effort is on updating specification documents with respect to changing implementation plans
-   Some updates to T3.5 based on cloud security scenarios produced by Cornelius
-   Research into emerging security threats and issues
-   Combined work in WP8 in documenting standard security controls for system applications

Plans for June to December 2013 (the rest of the project)
---------------------------------------------------------

Factors -

-   Very little effort remaining for any partner (AFAIK)
-   No deliverables are due (last one was M24)

Aims -

-   Lasting impact. Make sure the T3.5 work is not lost after the end of the project.
-   Relevance. Make sure the T3.5 remains up-to-date and helpful for WP4-8.
-   Validation. Provide feedbak from the implementation work to validate design decisions and identify flawed plans.

Activities

-   Support WP8 standardisation
-   Update specifications on application security controls, policies, authentication
-   Support publication of any remaining details in technical reports
-   Update specifications in line with proposed plans for multiple (local) personal zone hubs
