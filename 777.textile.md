Introduction
============

According to the use cases and requirements defined in WP2 and the common components introduced in task 3.1, task 3.2 has defined a set of application programming interface specifications (APIs) to make the desired functionalities available to Webinos applications.

Due to earlier or ongoing standardization and implementation activities, e.g. within "W3C":http://www.w3.org/ and "WAC":http://public.wholesaleappcommunity.com/redmine/embedded/wac2pubrev/index.html, some needed APIs are already specified and available in modern browsers. Other APIs have been specified but implementations have not yet been established in existing browsers and some APIs needed to fulfill Webinos functionality do not yet exist so these APIs have to be specified within the Webinos project.

A key feature of Webinos is the ability to discover services on remote devices and access these services using APIs. For example, an application can use the core Webinos Service Discovery API to search for a geolocation service on another device and then access this service through the standard W3C Geolocation API.

The Webinos APIs can be divided into a number of categories:

-   **Webinos base and generic objects/interfaces:** For example the Webinos core interface

-   **APIs for service discovery and remote API access:** APIs allowing applications to discover other devices and services/applications on other devices and on network servers and access these remote services.

-   **HW Resources APIs:** APIs allowing applications to access information and functionality relating to device HW resources such as GPS, camera, microphone, sensors, etc.

-   **Application Data APIs:** APIs allowing applications read and write access to application capabilites such as contact items, calender information, messages, media files, etc.

-   **Communication APIs:** APIs allowing applications to communicate with other applications in the same or another device.

-   **Application execution APIs:** APIs allowing webinos applications to launch other webinos and native applications.

-   **User profile and context APIs:** APIs allowing applications access to user profile data and user context.

-   **Security and Privacy APIs:** APIs related to the security model for Webinos.

All Webinos API specifications are available here: "Webinos Device APIs":http://dev.webinos.org/specifications/draft/

Given the sensitive nature of the data to which these APIs grant access, the APIs specified are either secure and privacy-enabling by design or implemented so that access to APIs are controlled by the Webinos security framework specified in WP 3.5.

The API development works in collaboration with WP8.1 to enable API standardizations on the one hand and to make use of existing specifications on the other hand.
