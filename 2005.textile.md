Proposals for Task 3.2 APIs to remove
=====================================

|**API**|**Motivation**|
|Media Capture API|superseeded by getUserMedia API (http://dev.w3.org/2011/webrtc/editor/getusermedia.html) that is much more better alligned with WebRTC and <video>/<audio>-tag and for which Web browsers implementations exist|
|Attestation API|Lack of real implementation â€” will be turned into an optional research api & possibly a separate project |
|User profile API|No implementation in webinos. OpenID was implemented for demo purposes. After deeper investigations it is clear, that openID could be used for userprofile experience (see http://openid.net/specs/openid-attribute-exchange-1_0.html) |
