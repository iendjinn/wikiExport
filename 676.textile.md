WP3 Status and Phone Call Preparation
=====================================

Task 3.1 Work Areas
-------------------

User ID and Data Management
---------------------------

### Progress made (with resources expended)

So far we have achieved (approximately 7.5 PM):

-   investigated in relevant state-of-the-art
-   defined an initial architecture for authentication
-   created use cases to cover the typical cases in which authentication is required
-   created sequence diagrams to describe the high level flow of messages in these use cases
-   created activity diagrams to draw the big picture of interaction with other subtopics
-   built liaisons with other subtopics (Discovery, Overlay Network, Privacy & Security, Policy Management)
-   identified user data which is required for identification and authentication and which is to be synchronised among all the devices of the user
-   defined an initial architecture of where to store user data and how to synchronise it

The essentials at a very brief glance:

-   Authentication is different depending on the environment
    -   within a personal zone, authentication is done by using pre-shared keys
    -   between devices and services on the Internet, authentication is done using an Identity Provider
-   The Identity Provider (IDP) is hosted by any 3rd party who operates as certification authority. It can issue identifiers and tokens. The tokens are used for Single Sign-on (SSO)
-   Each personal zone has one Personal Zone Hub (PZH) which controls identification, addressing and authentication in the zone
    -   The PZH is accessible on the Internet
    -   The PZH has a unique address, represented by a URI
    -   Additional services can be used (e.g. WebFinger) to obtain the unique address from some other information (e.g. an email address of the user)
    -   The PZH stores
        -   a list of all the devices belonging to the zone
        -   all identifiers of the user and the devices
        -   policies
    -   The store in the PZH is synchronised into a local data cache on each device of the zone
    -   Each device has a Personal Zone Proxy (PZP) which has the functionality of the PZH in the case that the device cannot access the Internet and thus cannot access the PZH
-   Authentication is two way: first user authenticates to one of his devices, then this device authenticates to other devices/apps/services on behalf of the user

For details, see all the wiki pages on [[User_ID_and_Data_Management|User Identity and Data Management]].

### Planned next steps (actions) + anticipated resources

Planned to be done during the Berlin meeting (0.2 PM):

-   done Sort out architecture details
-   done Ensure the same common understanding
-   done Decide on the most fundamental open issues
-   in progress Adjust architecture to the decisions
-   half done Synchronise with other sub-topic groups as needed
-   in progress Draft a first set of initial APIs

Planned to be done after the Berlin meeting (May + June; 5 PM):

-   Call with discovery and messaging to go over detailed flows- Nick
-   Finalise all background research work for deliverable - Sven on return
-   Update sequence diagrams to align with new architecture - Andrea
-   create intro section draft for deliverable - Nick
-   Frame the anonymised discovery problem, for discussion with 3.5 - Andrea
-   First draft if widl api - Nick
-   

### Decisions that need to be made â€“ and communicated

-   Decide on fundamental architecture design: will we have PZP and PZH? How is addressing done? - still oustanding - proposal in draft
-   How to identify users, devices, apps, services? Do we need to identify all these entities? - still oustanding - proposal in draft
-   How do applications specify their requirements for authentication and identity? E.g. how do they state that they need the user to be "logged in"? We need to walk-through some examples and work out what happens when users have multiple identities or want to remain mostly anonymous. ([[User_ID_and_Data_Management_Discussion#Open-Issues-as-of-14-April-2011|Issue]] 9)
    -   draft concept dicussed at berlin - shall be written up in draft
-   Should the app request and get credentials or is it webinos which does all the identification and authentication under the hood? ([[User_ID_and_Data_Management_Discussion#Open-Issues-as-of-14-April-2011|Issue]] 10) In other words, on which layer does authentication live in webinos?
    -   application requests - runtime satisfies - to be written up
-   How to authenticate users on devices with limited UI or on devices which are used by multiple people (e.g. TV)? ([[User_ID_and_Data_Management_Discussion#Open-Issues-as-of-14-April-2011|Issue]] 11)
-   Which security/usability trade-offs are we willing to accept? Some design decisions increase usability on the cost of security. One of them is the introduction of the PZP and PZH which requires storing credential and other sensitive data on each device of the user.
    -   no simple answer
-   Resolve the privacy discovery dilema

Policy Management
-----------------

### What we decided in Berlin:

-   We need to investigate the use of POWDER in WAC and whether it is sufficient for expressing privacy policies in webinos. Is it sufficient for users and applications? If not, we should use Dave’s suggested reduced P3P work.
-   Policy specification is largely independent of the "in zone" and "out of zone" discussion. However, being "in zone" is a pre-requisite for many policies to apply.
-   Policy synchronisation needs more work, in particular handling conflicts. We decided to make the structure of policy storage as fine-grained as possible so the impact is limited
-   Yes, we need to work through policies that refer to non-webinos devices.
-   Access control decisions should trigger new "events"
-   Obligation policies will not be specified in XACML but rather will be implementable as event handlers
-   Delegation policies: we’re not going to do them in the first phase.

### Planned next steps (actions)

-   Policy examples & workflows for cross-device interaction, including non-webinos devices. â€“ _Davide, Salvatore_
-   Policy examples & workflows for outsourced policy specification â€“ _Davide, Salvatore_
-   Policy examples & workflows for updates to applications and update â€“ _Davide, Salvatore_
-   Policy synchronisation â€“ _John_
-   Investigation of Powder/P3P policies for privacy â€“ _Davide, Salvatore_
-   Policy GUI specification & guidelines â€“ _John_
-   Workflow for checking application integrity and identity â€“ _John_
-   Standardising error messages as a result of "access denied" events: WAC approach probably sufficient. — Krishna: will add the data required
-   Privileged applications â€“ _Krishna_ (based on earlier email)

-   Set of examples of privileged applications, then some of the privileges they need access to and possibly even identify examples of what the APIs might look like.
-   How we specify which sources of privileged applications are trusted - e.g. perhaps only a device manufacturer. This also needs to fit into the general scheme of how applications are trusted with respect to who signs them.
-   Come up with examples of policies for them. So, for example, what kind of policies are required for :
     * An application installer
     * A process viewer
     * A policy management application (e.g. viewing existing user policies)
-   In addition, working on how different authorities might be involved, possibly looking at the WAC specifications for guidance. Some platforms have privileged applications provided by the manufacturer or operator. Salvatore to provide guidance on the structuring of XACML policies. Simon to give some examples of privileged apps.

### Open questions

-   How do we package scripts properly? <script> tag or another "widget"?
-   How do we specify and protect policies on the device, particularly those relating to operator/content provider/manufacturer policies?
-   Remote management: further thoughts needed on how to implement

Device, Application and Service Discovery
-----------------------------------------

### Progress made (with resources expended)

Approx spent man months 7.5 PM.

-   State of art analysis for different technologies relevant to (3.0PM)
-   High level diagram defined (0.50 PM)
-   Functional Model & APIs (0.50 PM)
-   Application Discovery (2 PM)
-   Collaborated with Overlay Network on Local discovery demo. (0.75 PM)
-   Working on discovery demos using XMPP, DHT (0.75PM)

### Planned next steps (actions) + anticipated resources

Major work left is remote discovery part and how to represent service data.
* Remote discovery mechanisms, e.g. XMPP, DHT - how it will fit into "Personal Zone" architecture (1 PM)
* Application discovery (1 PM)
* Service discovery - features and format (1 PM)
* Naming and Addressing (0.50 PM)
* Security Aspects (0.50 PM)
* USB discovery code (0.5PM)

### Decisions that need to be made â€“ and communicated

-   How event handling works with service advertisement & notification? ( to communicate with event handling)
-   How should the device ID be represented to application and how it is mapped to user ID (to communicate with IDM)
-   Expose availability and capability on the network based on policy (to communicate with Policy management)
-   Find device based on certain criteria: descriptions of device & services â€“ properties & Context, e.g. social proximity. (to communicate with Context Management)
-   How does the webinos runtime expose capabilities from non-webinos devices in it’s LAN? A webinos enabled device may proxy services provided by non-webinos devices, e.g. devices that are attached using shortrange connectivity (eg. a Bluetooth connected GPS receiver).
-   Do we really need application IDs?
-   Use of XMPP server for local webinos server and remote webinos server ?
-   Is there a need of a server mode for local connections or will ad-hoc p2p connection be sufficient?
-   What information (security, policies, etc) is stored locally and what is stored on the webinos server and how is this information synchronized (see Identity & User Data work area)

Web application packaging, handling and Web Runtime specification
-----------------------------------------------------------------

The web application specification ([[Webinos_Core]] [[Web_application_packaging_handling_and_Web_Runtime_specification]]) is divided into two main parts. First, the definition of what a webinos application is (from a technical point of view, packaging, application interface and distributed application definition) and secondly the definition of application specific webinos web runtime environment requirements (e.g, application life cycle and web technologies to be supported by the runtime).

### Progress made (with resources expended)

-   The current draft of the webinos application packaging specification is based on the W3C widget specification ("zipped ressource files and a xml based configuration and meta data file"). (1.1 PM)
    -   A number of new xml elements were added whereas some of them were taken from the Task 2.3 requirements and otheres were introduced to support webinos specific application features.
    -   The related w3c widget JavaScript application interface specification is extended to cover the added elements
    -   extension to the w3c packaging to contain so called child applications (application packages within a main application package) which can be installed on other devices in order to work together are defined (including automatic or programmatic deployment of child applications)
-   Definition of how JavaScript functions can be exposed to other applications or between child and main application. (1.1 PM)
-   Specifying how (remotely) hosted applications can be executed. (1.1 PM)
-   Draft specifications of the application life-cycle handling and web standards to be supported by webinos web runtimes (0.6 PM)
-   Demo Implementation of child application approach for distributing applications (0.5 PM)

### Planned next steps (actions) + anticipated resources

-   editorial: currently some parts of the specifications are only bullet point lists and some of the new elements are only briefly described (no examples of use yet) (0.7 PM)
-   based on the meeting outcome the distributed application sections must be adapted and completed (1.0 PM)

-   editing of specification for deliverable based comments of other partners (0.5 PM)
-   reviewing and commenting on specifications by other partners (0.8 PM)

‘Privileged applications’
-------------------------

### Progress made (with resources expended)

â€¢ Investigations made in the areas of BONDI, JavaScript and Android.
â€¢ JavaScript privileged APIâ€™s identified for Browser Implementation.
â€¢ Security, Permissions, Privileges, Access Controls areas addressed with respect to Android, BONDI and JavaScript.
â€¢ Use Cases and Requirements identified related to Privileges and Policy Management.
â€¢ Created Use cases, Requirements for Engine diagnose API (Similar to).
â€¢ Produced sequence diagrams in connection to Policy Management Data.
â€¢ Granting permissions, authorization, authentication, Manifest File (Android) and Privileges to a specific user/application identified in Android, BONDI and JavaScript.
â€¢ Conclusion reached to that there are similar issues that needs to be addressed in Policy Management so merged with Policy Management.

Total resources expended ~4.0PM

### Planned next steps (actions) + anticipated resources

â€¢ It will be a Sub Task now in the Policy Management.
â€¢ Considering Policy management from the perspective of an User, Operator or Device manufacturer. We need to consider how authorities and certificate hierarchies will work.
â€¢ Bring in some data from Content Adaption and Content Awareness, Extension Handling, Cross Domain Platforms with Privileged Apps and Services.

Some Issues to look into:
â€¢ Where do webinos installers, policy managers and device settings apps sit in the webinos architecture? Do they need special consideration?
â€¢ How do proprietary applications (E.g. those installed by the device manufacturer) get installed and how do users know their provenance (e.g. why they were installed, who trusts them)
â€¢ How are application certificates, developer certificates, and general root certificates handled?

Total resources estimated ~2.0PM

### Decisions that need to be made â€“ and communicated

â€¢ Privilege apps and services to Look into issues like Trust boundary, Identity and Integrity checks, Engine and HW management and some critical info of the Engine
â€¢ Access sensitive API’s of vehicle, mobile, setup box
â€¢ How to protect Runtime Enviroment from Hacks?
â€¢ The Applications to be signed and confirmed by the Device Manufacturer when using Sensitive API’s and Critical data
â€¢ To Monitor Engine data, mobile and setup box
â€¢ To use Cryptographic methods, Encryption code for Security purposes

Case 1 is enough to implement things like dashboard, installer, launcher, and policy manger. However, in our opinion could be useful to allow both kind of solutions, because case 2 allows direct control over API access by the API provider. E.g., a car manufacturer can write engine monitoring APIs and allow to access them only via the car manufacturer signed applications.

Total: 1.50 PM

### Decisions that need to be made â€“ and communicated

-   Is it ok to require that all webinos apps use UTF-8 encoding? (otherwise we have to implement encoding translations and it all gets very messy)
-   The "foundations spec":http://dev.webinos.org/redmine/projects/wp3-1/wiki/Spec_-_Foundations#Exposing-Application-Functionalities-as-Service-to-other-Applications seems to suggest that the WRE "registers" the service for an application by reading its static manifest- is this the only way to create a service? (in event handling we to address entities that may be created at runtime, e.g. pub/sub nodes…)
-   Publication/subscription needs some well-defined, transferable and easy-to-work-with policy representation…
-   Are we going to use XMPP for network-level event routing? (this has several implications in practice)
-   To which extent do we expect/desire/require to have Webinos on the "servers"? (i.e., can we avoid/reduce XMPP <-> Webinos events mapping?)
-   -Is page "[[Webinos architecture]]" where we have to write stuff about several WP 3.1 areas by 20/05?-
-   -It’s very unlikely to have a complete spec by 31/05. Stuff that I expect to be in good shape by then: event format, RPC, publication/subscription, application-level event handling, device-local messaging, API attempt. Stuff that I don’t expect to be ready: caching/storing/forwarding, network-level event exchange, security/policy considerations, UML diagrams.-
-   -What is a service? (this is especially related to RPC and publication/subscription- push vs pull services)-
-   -How is the WRE structured? (browser + server and microkernel-like arrangement debates)-
-   -Who defines event handling and event-based APIs (3.1 vs 3.2)?-
-   -What about i18n? (not so obvious in some cases, e.g. remote notifications)-
-   -Is URI ok for event types (and/or for generic identifiers)? And SHA-256 for event identifiers?-
-   -Is it acceptable to require JavaScript objects with non-standard lifetime? (i.e., using something that prevents the garbage collector to destroy a given object- this would allow cross-referencing among events, simplifying things quite a bit)-
-   -W.r.t. the PendingOp vs id vs void asynch method return value debate, it would be nice to support event un-sending and/or response ignoring, so that it gets easy to cancel operations everywhere else, but it’s not easy business and could impact performance… opinions?-
-   -I would propose not to use DOM events, but something lighter that can optionally be wrapped into the DOM eventing model… anybody against that?-

### Link to preliminary deliverable structure for this work area

A "normalized"/"formalized" version of the current content of the "Draft Architecture":http://dev.webinos.org/redmine/projects/wp3-1/wiki/Event_handling_%28subscriptionstoringforwarding%29#Draft-architecture section on the wiki page should be fine.

Browser plug-in / extension handling
------------------------------------

### Progress made (with resources expended)

-   state-of-the-art browser plug-ins and extensions (2.25 PM)
    -   [[NPAPI Pros and Cons| Netscape Plug-in API (NPAPI)]]
    -   [[PPAPI|Pepper API (PPAPI)]]
    -   [[NaCl|Google Native Client (NaCl)]]
    -   [[Chrome Extensions| Chrome Extensions]]
    -   [[Node.js Addons]]
-   initial high level architecture (0.5 PM)
-   proposal on parts to be specified (0.3 PM)
-   #320 "Recommendation for technical solution":http://dev.webinos.org/redmine/projects/wp3-1/wiki/Recommendation_for_extensions_in_webinos

### Planned next steps (actions) + anticipated resources

* Finalize state-of-the-art for FireBreath, js-ctypes (0.1 PM)
* Revisit and fine-tune architecture (0.3 PM)
* Finalize components to be specified (0.4 PM)
**** Coordindate with discorvery
**** Coordinate with application packaging
**** Coordinate with policy management
**Proposal for technical solution
** Write specification (1.5 PM)

### Decisions that need to be made â€“ and communicated

-   -Are we targeting 3rd party developers to build extensions/plugin? Or are extensions integrated by the device manufacturers/platform provider?-
    -   -If we target some kind of 3rd party developers, we need to agree on one (or more) technical solutions (NPAPI, Node.js addons, Addons to the JS-Engine), how extensions are developed, in order to incorporate policy or discovery mechanisms for all extensions.-
    -   -If we target device manufactures/platform provider, we leave it up to them, how they integrate extensions to the webinos runtime and how it interacts with the rest of system. In this cases we would only specify how an app developer can make use of an extension (Some JavaScript API or some stuff in the manifest).-
        Consensus: Targeting 3rd party developers as well

-   -Agree on a common understanding what extension will look like. Are we talking about plug-ins in the common browser sense? Or do we have something comparable to Node.js addons and js-ctypes in mind like the "Glossary":http://dev.webinos.org/redmine/projects/wp-0/wiki/Glossary#Extension suggests- adding functionality to the js-runtime?-
    -   -The standard for plug-ins is NPAPI and might be replaced by PEPPER some day. The NPAPI/PEPPER will then have its own window inside the webapplication, where it can draw things in it. The plugin would be able to expose it’s own API.
        This would mean the extension developer would have to follow the rules which are exposed on him by the NPruntime. The specification would be more or less a refer to the NPAPI documentation.-
    -   -Analyzing "the requiremenets relevant for the extension handling":http://dev.webinos.org/redmine/projects/wp3-1/wiki/Browser_plug-in__extension_handling#Relevant-requirements-for-plug-in-and-extension-handling suggests to follow a Node.js/js-ctypes approach-
-   Agree on one Recommendation: http://dev.webinos.org/redmine/projects/wp3-1/wiki/Recommendation_for_extensions_in_webinos#Recommendation

Context Awareness and Adaptation
--------------------------------

### Progress made (with resources expended)

Based on the data reported roughly 6pm have been spent on this area - yet almost roughly 2pm correspond to the participation to the project meeting in Torino.

Progress made
* Merging the Context Management and Context-Driven Adaptation areas and scoping objective (0,5 pm) - **DONE end of March**
* Mapping aspects of the new area to underlying context related requirements (0,5 pm) - **DONE end of March**
* State of the art Analysis (2,5 pm) - **DONE mid April**
**** Analysis of relevant EU research projects on aspects of context awareness (more than 20 projects have been reviewed on webTV, mobiles, e-Accessibility, context models, etc)
**** Review of standards and technologies for structuring context data (IDEAL 2, Activity Streams, RDF/RDFs, microFormats)
**** Review of available technological solutions in support of context awareness aspects (Android Fragments API, Volantis Mobile Content Framework, etc)
* Identifying Items to be delivered by end of June and assign to Partners (0,25 pm)- **DONE May 5th**
* Creating a whitepaper on webinos Context Model (0,25 pm) - **DONE May 9th** [[WhitePaperOnWEBINOSContextModel|available at "The WEBINOS Federated Context Model for Describing Social Activity Across Connected Devices"]]

### Planned next steps (actions) + anticipated resources

The items that are envisaged to be delivered within the next 2 months are:
* Webinos Context Model (context objects, their attributes and relationships in the context model) - **LAUNCHED May 5th** [[ConceptsConnectionsInWebinosContextModel|available at "Objects and Relationships in the Webinos Context Model"]]
* Form and representation of the Context Model (i.e. RDFa)

Coordinate with the work done in other areas to avoid redundancies and mis-alignment. In particular
* User ID and Data Management for creating the user profile and acquiring context data (what protocols we actually adopt i.e. Portable Contacts, XRD, open social, FOAF).
* What is the context acquisition mechanism, we need to ensure transparency among the many endpoints webinos has (one user, many devices, apps across devices) - we should re-use existing open approaches such as the open graph protocol
* Privacy for allowing access to context data in alignment with the webinos privacy framework
* Device Application and Service Discovery for supporting context reasoning functions (adaptations and social proximity)
.
