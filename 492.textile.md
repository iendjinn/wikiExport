-   TUM, BMW: Since these issues were not addressed in WP2 - Specify a UseCase and a Scenario for reference (example), Local API’s
-   Oxford, BMW: Privilege applications lies in-between Policy/Security and Browser/Plug-in - Need to be found out still (open issue)
-   Impleo: Privilege Applications lies on the top of the Architecture in webinos - comes in the Monitoring category and how third party applications fit in
-   suggestions to have an extension to the Browser rather than built in - refer from BONDI and Android
-   To use standard User/Admin privileges.

-   TUM, BMW, Oxford, Polito and Impleo: Whether to provide ‘Privileged Applications’ as local API’s to the Developers to add them in there applications or to have an Extension for applications (refer - BONDI).
    For further reference and implementation to be checked with BONDI/Android and get back by 15th March.
