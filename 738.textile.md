WAC Comparison
==============

This page summarises how webinos uses the WAC security and privacy specifications and highlights any differences. The following sections headings are taken from the "WAC 2.0 specifications":http://specs.wacapps.net/2.0/feb2011/core/widget-security-privacy.html

3. Widget Security and Privacy
------------------------------

### 3.1. Authentication

#### 3.1.1 AppStore Authentication

Notes:

* Webinos phase 1 does not include details of an AppStore or AppStoreClient, and no certification is assumed.
 * Widget downloads may be from non-https sites assuming their manifests include signatures from trusted parties.

#### 3.1.2 WRT Authentication

"WRT authentication ensures that a WAC-certified client is being used, e.g. to download WAC widgets or use network services provided by WAC members."

* There may be several webinos implementations. We have currently not considered any certification
 * The webinos runtime will support _attestation_ for devices which can provide it. This means that apps will be capable of assessing the integrity of webinos software instances

"SP-2050 The WRT MUST authenticate itself to network servers as necessary using a WAC-recognised client certificate unique to the WRT product and version. A "WAC-recognised client certificate" is one that has been issued by a WAC-recognised Certificate Authority (CA) and is considered valid by WAC, i.e. has not been revoked. "

* Webinos devices will have a certified keypair signed by the personal zone hub. This key can be used within the personal zone and to identify the device but should _not_ be used with untrusted devices or for discovery.
 * Webinos will provide access to keys stored on the platform.
 * There is no recognised single webinos authority.

#### 3.1.3 Widget Authentication

"SP-2060 The WRT MUST consider Widgets that have a self-signed author signature as "unrecognised"."
"SP-2061 The WRT MUST consider Widgets that have no author signature as "unrecognised"."

* Webinos will do the same in the above cases

"SP-2062 The WRT MUST consider Widgets that have a valid author signature (i.e. one that has not been revoked) belonging to a WAC-recognised identity as "recognised"."

* Webinos _will not_ attempt to validate authors against any new list of recognised identities.
 * Webinos _will_ verify any signatures against a list of certificates held within the runtime. This is browser-ssl like behaviour.

"SP-2063 For recognised widgets, the WRT MUST verify that the widget’s Recognised Origin matches the identity of the signer based on the Common Name attribute of the author certificate."
"SP-2064 The WRT MUST reject a widget as invalid if the widget’s Recognised Origin does not match the identity of the signing party of the author signature."

* Unknown

"SP-2065 The WRT MUST display the following author information to the user when confirming that the user wishes to install a widget: whether the widget is recognised or unrecognised, the validated author identity and author country."

* Webinos will display some author information. Future webinos implementations may attempt to link this to information drawn from social networks to establish trustworthiness
 * TODO: How much information?

"SP-2066 The WRT MUST allow installation of widgets with expired author certificates, if installation is not blocked by other conditions (e.g. SP-2067, SP-2130)."

* Webinos will follow this requirement

"SP-2067 The WRT MUST provide a user-configurable ‘secure-by-default’ preference to enable installation of widgets that are not distributor-signed, with the default value set to "No". If the user selects "Yes", they MUST be shown a warning explaining the potential dangers of installing unsigned widgets."

* Webinos will default to disallowing web apps and will allow such a dialogue to be implemented

"SP-2068 The WRT MAY further enhance the functionality in SP-2067 by supporting a latch function to reset the user preference once they have installed an unsigned widget. The options popup for this sub-functionality could be as follows: "only for one application", "for 15 minutes", "forever"."

* Webinos has no requirements to implement a latch policy. Phase two could investigate the option for applications to run in a sandbox, like the one described in "this paper on the android system":http://news.ncsu.edu/releases/wms-jiang-tissa/

### 3.2. Widget Signatures

"SP-2080 The WRT MUST support widget signature processing as specified in Widgets Digital Signature [Widgets-DigSig]. Test: Test Suite for the "Digital Signatures For Widgets" Specification."

* Webinos will follow this requirement

"Every widget offered by developers to WAC, and delivered to a WRT through a WAC channel, MUST have a valid author signature. An author signature is considered valid if either: it is self-signed - ie the signature chains to a certificate, which is included in the signature document itself, which is self-signed; or it is signed by a certificate belonging to a WAC-recognised identity."

* Webinos will follow this requirement except "WAC-recognised identity" will just be "runtime recognised identity" - an identity verifiable by the certificates held in the runtime.
 * Webinos will also follow SP-2090, SP-2100, SP-2110 and SP-2120 requirements, except the table…

#### Table SP-2120

![](http://specs.wacapps.net/2.0/feb2011/core/signatures.png)

The following changes will be made to this table:

-   …

#### 3.2.1. Signature Revocation

Webinos will follow all requirements in this section.

### 3.3. Widget Protection

Webinos will follow requirements SP-2180 and SP-2185 in this section. Widget sharing is not considered to be part of the security framework, and WAC signed widgets are not relevant. However, Webinos _shall_ support policies which dictate where widgets made be loaded from, which could implement SP-2196.

### 3.4. Security Framework

Webinos will follow SP-2200

#### 3.4.1. Policy Definition

##### 3.4.1.1. Trust Domains

Webinos will follow SP-2240

##### 3.4.1.2. Policy Rules

"SP-2250 The WRT MUST support the following options for policy rule effects: Blanket prompt, session prompt, one-shot prompt, permit, deny"

Webinos will support this requirement.

##### 3.4.1.3. Policy Structure

Webinos policies will refer to applications as the subject. This is documented in more detail in the T3.1 page.

##### 3.4.1.4. Sensitive Functions

SP-2280 Webinos policies will be capable of supporting access control to all APIs and device capabilities in webinos.

SP-2281 Webinos policies will be capable of mediating all network access and access to particular endpoints. Policies must be able to say "Application X cannot access my set top box"

##### 3.4.1.5. Security Parameters

"SP-2282 The WRT MUST support the following environment attributes and device capability request parameters in policy rules: … "

These environment rules and parameters will be followed by webinos

##### 3.4.1.6. Specific Clarifications

"SP-2300 When access has been granted to a particular filesystem location, the WRT MUST grant access to all subordinate locations (e.g. subdirectories) for the duration of the access granted to the filesystem."

Webinos will follow this rule.

#### 3.4.2. Policy Deployment

Webinos will follow SP-2320, SP-2330, and SP-2340.

Webinos will follow SP-2351: "The WRT MAY be capable of applying different policies depending upon device configuration or user identity/role, e.g. for application of enterprise policies or parental control policies."

Webinos will follow SP-2352 (new requirement for webinos)

#### 3.4.3. Policy Enforcement

Webinos follows SP-2360, SP-2370, SP-2380 and the "BONDI A&S Appendices Appendix B":http://bondi.omtp.org/1.1/security/BONDI_Architecture_and_Security_Appendices_v1.1.pdf .

#### 3.4.4. User Prompting and Preferences

Webinos specifications do include some GUIs, but these are guidelines only.

Webinos will follow SP-2390, SP-2400, SP-2420, SP-2421 and SP-2422.

Requirements SP-2405 and SP-2406 will be provided by allowing XACML combination policies with set priorities.

### 3.5. Security Features of Web Technologies

#### 3.5.1. Widget Access Request Policy

Webinos will follow these requirements

### 3.6. Non-WAC APIs

Webinos will not follow SP-2460 but the policy infrastructure should allow this to be possible.

### 3.7. Description Resources

Webinos will have a similar approach to SP-2650 and POWDER policies, but this is still being confirmed. SP-2691…3 will therefore not necessarily be followed.

SP-2660 to 2690 will be followed.

### 3.8. Privacy

SP-2480 and SP-2490 should be followed by webinos.

Again, POWDER policies may be used but this is up for consideration.

#### 3.8.1 Privacy Considerations for API Usage

#### 3.8.2 Privacy Considerations for Device Property Access

### 3.9. Parental Mode

### 3.10. Default Policy

#### 3.10.1 Trust Domains

#### 3.10.2 Permissions
