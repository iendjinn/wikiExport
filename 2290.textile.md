The W3C Media Capture and Streams API
-------------------------------------

### Overview of API

http://dev.w3.org/2011/webrtc/editor/getusermedia.html

This specification defines an API that provides access to the audio, image and video capture capabilities of the device. Development on the previously referred _W3C Media Capture API_ (http://www.w3.org/TR/media-capture-api/) has stopped, and further work is taking place as part of _Media Capture and Streams_ (http://dev.w3.org/2011/webrtc/editor/getusermedia.html).

### Threats

#### API-Specific threats and misuse cases

1.  This API could be used to compromise the privacy of the user, as the accessed media may contain private information, either directly in audio or video form or could be derived from the shown surrounding, e.g. location of the user, contact/dialogues with other persons or in the simplest case the presence of the user.
2.  Accessed audio or video could be used to build user profiles, e.g. music/TV in background captured and delivered with the stream.
3.  Users will expect the same security in Web based real-time communication as they are used to from traditional telephony service, e.g. the identification of callee and caller is up the application. A user may be communicating with someone else than he/she is expecting.

#### Threats based on remote invocation of this API from another device

1.  Any mechanism that bypasses the user consent to allow the media capture could be misused by potentially malicious apps. As this API introduces programmatically privacy threats and was originally designed for the Web browser execution environment an user consent prompt is an inherent part of its rationale. Any remote invocation should therefore incorporate user consent as well. Implications of a remote prompt needs to be examined.
2.  API usage could generate high costs through generation of high volume data

#### Implementation threats and possible attacks

In the first phase of the project this API was not implemented. Only theoretical assertions can be made currently.

1.  The concurrent access to media capture devices could be made possible but could have consequences of the end user. For example, once a user has granted access within one application and switches to use a different application then the first one may still have access to the media capture devices. This leads to a requirement of exclusive usage of a specific device and revocation of granted access rights.

#### Threats to apps and developers using this API (E.g. Jimmy and Jessica)

1.  In both cases exclusive and shared access to media capture devices unexpected behavior. Exclusivity may lead to denial of service and shared operation mode to non-transparency for the end user.

#### Threats to device manufacturers, operators, other stakeholders

1.  Enabling audio and video communication in Web applications may have impact on the traditional telephony via mobile/fixed operated networks as well as VoIP networks
2.  Device manufacturers may be forced to improve their products to support media processing for Web based communication (hardware media en/decoding) to lower the thread of high cpu usage and unresponsive devices

### Mitigations

-   Require explicit user consent before a service may be accessed
-   Provide a notification when a deviceâ€™s media capture services are in use. Also make clear from the calling device where a media capture service is hosted (e.g., which device is providing the API).

### Recommended default policy rules for applications

  ------------- ------------------------------------------------------
  _.Code   _.Type
  B-A           Browser-based, authenticated via TLS certificates
  W-R           Widget, authenticated using a recognised certificate
  W-U           Widget, unrecognised

  _.B-A   _.W-R   _.W-U   _.Policy                       _.Explanation (Widgets)                                                                                                                             _.Explanation (Browser Apps)                                                                                                       Silently allow                        2. Applications will be granted access to this API without user consent being required. This can only be modified using a policy editor.
                                         Default allow (install time)        Widgets will need user consent at install time, but users will expect to allow it (the tick-box will automatically be filled in).                        Web pages will prompt for consent (Yes / No / Always) at runtime, this preference will be saved.
  X            X                         Default ask at runtime (one-shot)   Widgets will require one-off user consent at runtime. This fact will be visible & modifiable at install time.                                            Web pages will prompt for consent (Yes / No / Always) at runtime, this preference will be saved.                                    X   Default ask at runtime (every time)   Widgets will require user consent at runtime, every time. This fact will be visible & modifiable at install time.
                                         Default deny (install time)         Widgets will require user consent at install time, but users will expect NOT to allow it (the tick-box will automatically be empty).                     Web pages will display a short notification at first-use saying that access was denied, with a button to change settings
                                         Silently deny                       2. Applications will not be granted access to this API, and users will not be asked at install time. This can only be modified using a policy editor.
