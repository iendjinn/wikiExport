June 30 delivery wiki page prepared: http://dev.webinos.org/redmine/projects/t3-2/wiki/WP_32_Deliverable
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Status of input: No comments

API guidelines (http://dev.webinos.org/redmine/issues/194)
----------------------------------------------------------

Issues:

-   Nullable interface data types in latest WebIDL specification. Interface data types that should be nullable should have "?" after the argument type: (http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-device-apis/2011May/0025.html)

-   Should we state [NoInterfaceObject]? See http://dev.w3.org/2006/webapi/WebIDL/#NoInterfaceObject. DAP and WAC specifications state [NoInterfaceObject].

-   WAC also uses the [Callback] and [Callback=FunctionOnly] extended attributes (http://dev.w3.org/2006/webapi/WebIDL/#Callback). Should Webinos?

Action http://dev.webinos.org/redmine/issues/355 on Nick to check with Daniel.

Consistent namespace in Webinos API examples.
---------------------------------------------

Claes suggests: webinos.module.method(), for example â€œwebinos.sensors.getSensors();â€ except for ServiceDiscovery/Bind as these APIs are â€œoverlayingâ€.

No objections. All to update code examples to be consistent.

Wrappers around referred specifications from W3C and WAC
--------------------------------------------------------

Claes view:

-   I am considering if we should skip this. Unsure on the benefits and getting closer to deadline. Arguments for these â€œwrappersâ€ were: â€œWe can add statements related to securityâ€ â€“ but if we need we can instead have a single specification defining statements relating to the Webinos security model, e.g. â€œfeature URLsâ€ for the different methods.
-   â€œWe can add statements relating to remote accessâ€ â€“ but I donâ€™t think that we need to add anything in referred APIs for remote access. This should be covered by the Service Discovery/Bind API.
-   IMO the only reason to have a wrapper is if we need to extend or change the syntax/semantics of a referred API.

Nick thinks there are still reasons for having wrappers due to provide consistent Webinos specifications. Dom mentioned that for referred W3C API specifications this does not mean just simple copy and paste as W3C and Webinos use different WebIDL tools.

Action http://dev.webinos.org/redmine/issues/356 on Nick

Payment API (http://dev.webinos.org/specifications/draft/payment.html)
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Referring to discussion by e-mail.

Dom stated that it does not make sense to have just a client side API as a server side infrastructure also has to be defined due to security reasons. There are existing solutions, e.g. the Google Web payment API pointed out by Daniel. Dom means that we either have to drop the API or specify a whole solution including the server side infrastructure.

Hans informed about discussions at the WP 3.5 meeting and pointed at the "Shopping asset model":http://dev.webinos.org/redmine/projects/wp2-8/wiki/Shopping_asset_model they defined.

Christian proposed a generic payment API for developers that hides the specific payment solutions implemented.

Nick stated the importance of addressing payment in the WP 3.2 delivery. If we don’t have this topic in the delivery there will be serious remarks at the EU-review.

Dom stated that we don’t need an API but that we instead should define a payment infrastructure.

Hans meant that the "Payment Adpter" is the key and promotes an API. We don’t need to define the server side. Should use "JSR 229":http://www.jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=229 as starting point.

Seems difficult to reach consensus but one proposal is to provide background information on existing payment solutions and also a "Generic Payment API" according to Christian’s proposal.

Action http://dev.webinos.org/redmine/issues/258 on Christian.

Event handling APIs
-------------------

Referring to "Service discovery/binding and event handling meeting 2011-05-24":http://dev.webinos.org/redmine/projects/t3-2/wiki/Service_discoverybinding_and_event_handling_meeting_2011-05-24, consider a 3rd alternative, i.e. a simplified event API that only supports addEventListener, removeEventListener, dispatchEvent as a tangible Event handlng Widl API specification for WP 3.2 delivery. This has earlier been proposed by Andre according to http:// dev.webinos.org /redmine/issues/259.

Stefano stated that the event handling architecture is in place in WP 3.1 and he will try to create a tangible API proposal for the Sophia meeting. However, Stefano stated that with this simplified approach it will not be possible to fulfill all requirements.

Action http://dev.webinos.org/redmine/issues/267 on Stefano.

Other APIs â€“ status issues
----------------------------

-   ServiceDiscovery API: Anders will make updates according to meeting 2011-05-24
-   Vehicle API: New version uploaded to Git repository. All to review.
-   TV API: New version uploaded to Git repository. All to review.
-   NFC API: Stefano Vercelli is working on a proposal that shortly will be uploaded to Git repository.
-   Application Execution APIs: Background information on wiki updated. Two APIs will be included in phase 1, "Launch installed Webinos application API" and "Check if webinos application is installed in device".
-   Platform Attestation API: widl specification to be done.
    o User Profile API
    o Sensor API
