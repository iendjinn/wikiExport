Privileged Applications
-----------------------

### Introduction

A Privileged application is an application that has full access to the webinos runtime and can use non-public APIs. It can potentially access and modify standard system controls (policies) and check for specific user IDs (UIDs), group IDs (GIDs), authorizations, or privileges. Privileged applications and services in webinos are necessary for the following situations:

1.  To modify and view security and privacy policies
2.  To modify and view stored context data
3.  To create applications which take advantage of non-public webinos APIs. These applications should become non-privileged as soon as the APIs are published
4.  To access system commands and classes which manage OS services and other sensitive data.
5.  Monitoring system activity and report errors for debugging.

This section describes additional security aspects in the area of privileged applications and services.

### Background

#### Related Requirements

This section of the specification aims to satisfy (partially) the following requirements:

-   "PS-USR-Oxford-50":http://dev.webinos.org/redmine/projects/wp2-2/wiki/DeliverableVersionAll#PS-USR-Oxford-50 : Users shall be provided with the ability to identify applications which have been granted particular privileges.
-   "PS-USR-Oxford-51":http://dev.webinos.org/redmine/projects/wp2-2/wiki/DeliverableVersionAll#PS-USR-Oxford-51 : Users shall be able to view a list of all of their webinos applications and show the authority that certified the application.
-   "PS-USR-Oxford-116":http://dev.webinos.org/redmine/projects/wp2-2/wiki/DeliverableVersionAll#PS-USR-Oxford-116 : The webinos Runtime Environment shall protect applications and itself from potentially malicious applications and shall protect the device from being made unusable or damaged by applications.
-   "PS-DWP-ISMB-202":http://dev.webinos.org/redmine/projects/wp2-2/wiki/DeliverableVersionAll#PS-DWP-ISMB-202 : The webinos runtime must ensure that an application does not access device features, extensions and content other than those associated to it.
-   "PS-USR-Oxford-35":http://dev.webinos.org/redmine/projects/wp2-2/wiki/DeliverableVersionAll#PS-USR-Oxford-35 : webinos access control policies shall be able to specify fine-grained controls involving the source and content of an access control request.
-   "PS-USR-Oxford-38":http://dev.webinos.org/redmine/projects/wp2-2/wiki/DeliverableVersionAll#PS-USR-Oxford-38 : webinos shall allow policies which specify confirmation at runtime by a user when an access request decision is required.
-   "PS-USR-Oxford-115":http://dev.webinos.org/redmine/projects/wp2-2/wiki/DeliverableVersionAll#PS-USR-Oxford-115 : webinos shall encourage good design techniques and principles so users are not forced to accept unreasonable privacy policies and access control policies.
-   "PS-USR-Oxford-72":http://dev.webinos.org/redmine/projects/wp2-2/wiki/DeliverableVersionAll#PS-USR-Oxford-72 : The webinos system shall support applications which apply access control policies to data produced or owned by the application developer. These policies may support revocation of access control policies.
-   "PS-USR-Oxford-36":http://dev.webinos.org/redmine/projects/wp2-2/wiki/DeliverableVersionAll#PS-USR-Oxford-36 : webinos APIs shall provide error results when an access control request is denied.

-   "PS-USR-Oxford-17":http://dev.webinos.org/redmine/projects/wp2-2/wiki/DeliverableVersionAll#PS-USR-Oxford-17 : The webinos Runtime Environment shall be capable of setting dynamic access control policies for device data when initiating an association to another webinos Device.
-   "PS-DEV-Oxford-28":http://dev.webinos.org/redmine/projects/wp2-2/wiki/DeliverableVersionAll#PS-DEV-Oxford-28 : The webinos Runtime shall provide access control for context structures with user-defined policies.

### Threats

The main threats caused by privileged applications are the following:

-   A _malicious_ privileged application could be installed and then take control over all aspects of the personal zone. This could perform denial of service attacks, steal identity information or perform other undesirable activity.
-   An unprivileged application takes advantage of a privileged application on the system to access resources and data it should not have access to.
-   A privileged application unintentionally exposes private or confidential data.

The threats from privileged applications are significant, as discussed in the following quote:

> ‘ "As with Windows, the most infected computers are those on which users have administrator privileges, the greatest risk of infection is faced by those Android systems which have been jailbroken," Kaspersky analyst Yury Namestnikov. "Mobile malware communicates with its owners using a method that is widely employed by Windows malware â€“ via command-and-control centers, which will ultimately lead to the emergence of mobile botnets," he adds.’ ([[Deliverable_References#Leyden2011|Leyden2011]]).

### Security Policy settings for privileged applications

Webinos supports two tiers of access for applications. Normal applications are capable of anything their XACML policies say they are capable of doing, which is restricted to accessing only public APIs defined in ([[Deliverable_References#Webinos-D32|Webinos-D32]]). Privileged applications, on the other hand, are capable of accessing any internal functionality of webinos, including native code execution, access to secure storage, and more.

A privileged application, like any other webinos application, is signed by a private signing key. This key must have a certificate held on the device in and marked in the system policy as being valid for privileged applications. It is expected that on many devices the only privileged applications may be those issued by the original manufacturer or network operator.

When an applications is installed, webinos will mark some applications as privileged. The rules and impact of doing so are defined as follows:

-   Applications signed with a certificate from the an authority deemed to be capable of giving full privileges (i.e. one who’s certificate is marked by the policy as being allowed to do so) can execute with privileged permissions and therefore have full access to the webinos device.
-   All other applications run with normal permissions. Applications running with normal permissions are constrained by policies, but this may allow them to read from protected areas of the personal zone storage, and read contents of files stored by the PZP. They cannot write to policies, system files, or execute native code.
-   Privileged applications on one device in a personal zone are not allowed to have full privileges on another in-zone device. However, they are permitted to modify policies and synchronised settings, so they can potentially do this if necessary.

### Future Directions

Privileged applications are a necessity in application environments such as webinos. However, they have a significant risk and should be avoided where possible. The main focus in the future will be on developing mitigation strategies for dealing with privileged applications, including further monitoring, reporting and access control restrictions. At the same time, the reasons for developing a privileged application will be removed by exposing more public API functionality (so that normal applications are able to do more) and improving support for extensions so that native capabilities are implemented there.
