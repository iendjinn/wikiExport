WP31 Context Adaptation
=======================

Applications can be designed to adapt to changes in the context, e.g. to dynamic changes in user preferences, or in the environment. Adaptation is also used to fit the characteristics of devices, e.g. display size and input mechanisms.

Security Considerations
-----------------------

Some things to think about:

### New people entering into a space of some kind

Is the newcomer to be trusted? If not, what kinds of adaptations are appropriate?

### New devices or services

Similarly, is the new device or service to be trusted, and how to react to this eventuality?

### Harmful adaptations

Should a given adaptation rule be ignored on the grounds that it might have a harmful effect?

Privacy Considerations
----------------------

-   access to personal preferences and sensitive metadata
-   access to the context, i.e. its current state
-   access to notifications of adaptations
