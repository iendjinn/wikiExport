API types
=========

JavaScript APIs
---------------

A JavaScript API is the most common way to provide web application access to device hardware and software resources. "Web Interface Description Language (Web IDL)":http://www.w3.org/TR/WebIDL/ is used to specify JavaScript APIs.

A typical example of a JavaScript API is the "W3C Contacts API":http://dev.w3.org/2009/dap/contacts/. The usage of the "contacts.find" method is examplified below:

// Perform an address book search. Obtain the ‘name’ and ‘emails’ properties and initially filter the list to Contact records containing ‘Bob’:

navigator.contacts.find( [‘name’, ‘emails’], successCallback, errorCallback, {filter: ‘Bob’} );

The example above illustrates an asynchronous JavaScript method, which is very common for JS device APIs. Asynchronous methods return immediately and notify the caller at some point in the future of the results via callback methods. Methods that may take a long time to be executed or that may be subject to security prompt must be defined as asynchronous methods. The successCallback above is a function to be invoked in case of success and the errorCallback is a function to call when the asynchronous operation fails.

Using HTML-elements
-------------------

In some cases access to device resources can be provided through a simple html-element. One example is the "W3C HTML Media Capture specification":http://dev.w3.org/2009/dap/camera/. This specification states that if an input element in the File Upload state contains accept attribute with values image/*, audio/*, or video/*, the user agent can invoke a file picker that allows respectively the user to take a picture, record a sound file, or record a video in addition to selecting an existing file from the file system. Furthermore, a new â€œcaptureâ€ attribute may be added to the input element. This attribute gives a hint to the user agent on the source of the input. The â€œcaptureâ€ attribute can take the values camera, camcorder, microphone and filesystem.

For example, the following code indicates that the user is expected to upload an image from the device camera:

< input type="file" accept="image/* " capture="camera" id="capture" >

When rendering this code the user agent will open the camera viewfinder and allow the user to take a picture.

HTML "file-picker" based access to device resources is very straight forward and intuitive for users and provide for "implicit user consent" as the user must provide a tangible action to allow access to the requested resource. For example navigating to a folder in the file system and selecting a file or using the camera viewfinder and pressing the shutter button to take a picture.

Using DOM events
----------------

For providing web applications access to data that is frequently updated, for example data from sensors in the device, a DOM event based interface is often applicable. Examples are the "W3C DeviceOrientation Event Specification":http://dev.w3.org/geo/api/spec-source-orientation.html and the "W3C Battery Status Event Specification":http://dev.w3.org/2009/dap/system-info/battery-status.html. Several new Webinos APIs are also DOM event based.

An event based API is defined by adding attributes to the "DOM event interface":http://www.w3.org/TR/2011/WD-DOM-Level-3-Events-20110531/#interface-Event. For example, the DeviceOrientation Event Specification defines an "deviceorienationevent", which has three attributes for device orientation, alpha angle, beta angle and gamma angle.

A web application can register to listen to DOM events using the addEventListener method. For example, registering to receive deviceorientation events could be done with the code below:

window.addEventListener("deviceorientation", function(event) {
 // code for processing the the device orientation event data, i.e. event.alpha, event.beta and
 // event.gamma
 }, true);

The second parameter is a method that is called whenever an event occurs of type "deviceorientation".

Using REST
----------

REST (Representational State Transfer) APIs are frequently used on the web. Such an API is specified as a URI and the requested resource/service is accessed through the standard HTTP methods GET, POST, PUT, DELETE.

A simple example is a Twitter API for retrieving the 20 most recent statuses. In this example the requested data is returned in JSON format.
 http://api.twitter.com/1/statuses/public_timeline.json

One major advantage with REST APIs is that a requested resource/service could be situtated "anywhere", in the cloud or in the device, but still be accessed with the same API. By implementing access to local resources/services through â€œVirtual Local Web Serversâ€ REST APIs could also be used to access local in-device resources/services.

Furthermore REST is stateless, which facilitates scalable solutions so that many users can be supported.

If coding gets complicated when REST APIs are used then JavaScript "wrapper" methods can be created to facilitate for developers. These "wrapper" methods do not have to be standardized and could be provided by exstablished JavaScript library/framework providers.
