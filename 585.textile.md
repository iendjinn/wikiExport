20110408 conf call on User Identity and User Data Management
============================================================

Date: 8 Apr 2011
Time: 11:00 - 12:00 CEDT
Bridge: PowWowNow, _Enhanced Access_, PIN: 312806, "Dial-in numbers":http://pdf.powwownow.com/pdf/GBR_en_pwn-dial-in-numbers.pdf

Agenda:
* further details of the architecture, based on activity diagrams of the use cases

Action Items:
* Sven: Draw flow chart of the big picture of the entire identification and authentication process
* Sven: Collect questions for discovery people and post them to the discovery group
* John, Steffen: flesh out details on offline case, local cache, local self-hosted IDP
* Andrea: zero-proof investigations with Dave
* Nick, Habib: small Bluetooth test
* Sven: collect features of IDP

Attendees:
* Nick
* John
* Andrea
* Sven
* Christian
* Steffen
* Habib

Discussion:
* All today’s discussion is based on the current "Authentication Architecture Draft (v2)":http://dev.webinos.org/redmine/attachments/492/webinos_AA_proposal_v2.ppt and the sequence diagrams for the [[Use Cases]]
* Discovery is similar in scenarios 1 and 2 but it might be different in reality once we know how discovery is actually done
**** Discovery may affect the steps thereafter
**** Need to discuss with the discovery people
**** Nick: Discovery call should be intercepted by policy mechanism as this is security/privacy critical
**** Nick: in online case, use IDP for mapping of user and device ID
**** Nick: local (= no Internet access) is tricky:
*** Find all discoverable devices, find own discoverable devices (no central entity available)
** Broadcast, nothing is known
**** Privacy issue
*** Physical mapping required
* IDP
** Multiple independent IDP will be issued
**** Performs
*** Attestation and user auth
*** Mapping of user ID and the set of devices belonging to that user
*** This information needs to be cached on all devices of the user
** Crypto required to store the info securely?
**** Sync required
**** If there is a master among the userâ€™s devices, sync is more easy
**** Local temporary copy of the IDP should be a local Web server
***** Same technologies/protocols as real IDP
***** Sync is important
***** Caches only data about the owner and his devices; stores nothing about any other users (scalability!)
* User data management
**** Sync of IDP and local cache on all devices of the user
*** Steffen: reliability problem when integrating a new device
*** Policy management has the same problem
**** Joining effort may make sense (John, Steffen)
*** Can we dare to allow new devices to join only if there is online connectivity
* Device discovery
** Agreement on using IDP for user ID / device ID mapping required
**** Can the discovery process distinguish own devices from all other devices?
**** Andrea: encrypted HELLO response (see sequence diagrams) may make sense during discovery. Is that possible/supported?
**** Discovery can be costly in terms of power consumption, computation and time. What about limited devices?
**** Small Bluetooth (BT) discovery test with Habib and Nick: Bind two devices in unconnected state and authenticate users during this step requires local auth server
*** Steffen: in offline case no auth can be done on behalf of an online IDP
*** Local cache of user credential from the IDP required to be able to authenticate the user in the offline case
* IDP
**** Instead of the central online IDP, it can be hosted on one of the own devices. Does that ease things?
**** Cannot be a particular one as this one may not be reachable in offline case
* Three cases to distinguish
**** Own cloud: only devices of the own personal cloud of a user are communicating
*** Due to pre-shared key relatively easy
** Access services on the web
*** Due to Internet access and accessibility of IDP relatively easy
** Add other userâ€™s device to a personal cloud temporarily without internet access
*** Most tricky one
*** Andrea: See the three alternatives in the sequence diagrams for pairing
*** John: alternative: grant temporary token: start out-of-band communication (e.g. PIN in BT pairing) and then issue token to use
*** Steffen: requires UI; what about sensors? All webinos devices have UI

Next meeting: conf call on Thu 14 Apr 16:00 - 17:00 CEDT
