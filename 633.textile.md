Establishing the need for gallery
=================================

There has been discussion as to whether a gallery is required and whether file access alone is enough. The rationale being that all media files are encapsulated as files.

There are several reasons why a gallery it would be a good idea:

-   Remote galleries: file access api will not give to access to remote galleries - a common use case
-   Performance: many galleries are very large. Iterating over 10,000 files may not be best way to deal with it
-   Metadata and thumbnails: for media the most important thing is the meta -data- a file access method would require implementing all file types and tag formats on JavaScript. This it to complex and inefficient
-   Binary data: Javascript and file access methods do not yet support binary data very well

Recommended way forward
=======================

Base the Webinos Gallery API on the W3C Gallery API.
