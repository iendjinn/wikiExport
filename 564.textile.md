WebFinger
=========

Introduction
------------

WebFinger is protocol inspired by the old Name Finger protocol defined in [RFC 742]. The Name Finger protocol enables the possibility to get information about a given user. WebFinger is an evolution that instead of using a direct TCP connection, it uses HTTP, XRD and Web Host Metadata to provide a descriptor of a single user. The protocol consists of two parts:

-   One URI schemes to identify user accounts, e.g. acct:joe@example.com
-   A simple protocol for resolving a user account into an extensible descriptor formate as a XRD resource.

The protocol is not an official standard but the work has been driven by several parties involved Identity Commons, http://www.idcommons.net/, that is a community of groups working on developing the identity and social layer of the web.

Use Cases
---------

-   A user would like to invite a friend to a meeting. The user knows the identity of the friend but is not aware about which calender services the friend is using. The application resolves the account id by sending a WebFinger request to a WebFinger service. The WebFinger service responds with a description of the different accounts that the friend is known under.

Technical Description
---------------------

WebFinger provide the means to get a descriptor of different user accounts. The service leverage on already defined or draft standards:

-   Host-meta [IETF, draft-hammer-hostmeta-13]
-   Extensible Resource Description 1.0 XRD, [OASIS]
-   Well-Known URI [RFC5785]

The well-known URI [RFC5785] specification defines a method to find meta data about a given host. This is accomplished by reserving a specific URI that can be used to expose information about a particular host. The URI reserved in RFC5785 is the URI /.well-known/. This mechanism is then extended by the Host-meta specification that defines that /.well-known/host-meta/ URI can be used to get a description about a particular host. For example issuing an HTTP request to http://www.example.com/.well-known/host-meta/ will return a XRD description defining the capabilities of the www.example.com host. By examining XRD file it is possible to find whether the host provides a WebFinger service and which URI that should be used to utilise the service. The accout is the then resolved by the WebFinger service URI and a new XRD document is provided describing the accounts.

Comparison Analysis
-------------------

|Technology|Implementation|Integrate with Browser|Network structure - central point required|More comparing critera…|
|WebFinger|http://webfinger.net http://code.google.com/p/webfinger/|Yes - the API can be used via XHR. |WebFinger requires that there is a central WebFinger Service provider. In addition it also requires that user accounts and services are registered in the webfinger service.||

Gap Analysis
------------

|Requirements|GAP|Proposal Solutions|
|DA-DEV-SEMC-001|There are no means to expose availability |RFC5785 in combination with XRD could be a method to expose capabilities|
|DA-DEV-SEMC-008|WebFinger could potentially be solution if the device address is registered as an account in the webfinger service.||
|DA-USR-FHG-001|WebFinger could potentially be solution if the device are registered in the webfinger service||
|DA-USR-FHG-002|The XRD content contains meta data about the user including name. Normally the profile contains more than just the name. ||
|DA-DEV-ISMB-006| WebFinger is about getting detailed information about accounts that can be addressable entities.||

Conclusion
----------

The work with WebFinger is very much driven by implementations and is not formalized in a traditional meaning, i.e. it is experiment of enhancing the social layers of the web and make those discoverable. The service as such is not well deployed yet but it describes an interesting method for finding which accounts and services that is available for a certain user. The technology starts to make it possible to discover which services that are used by different users. One interesting idea is to explore if all devices are registered in a WebFinger service. That would require that new API’s are defined to add and remove devices from the WebFinger service. Such API’s are currently not defined.

Independently of Webfinger the mechanism defined in: Well-Known URI [RFC5785], could be interesting for Webinos to explore. It would be a simple and efficient method if every Webinos device could expose the capabilities under a Well-known URI and device interested in the capabilities of a different device could just issue an HTTP request to the device at the predefined well-known URL and thereby get information about available resources. That could also be utilized to get information about local resources by issuing a request using localhost for example http://localhost/.well-known/webinos.

The biggest gap with the technology is that it do not attempt to solve the issue that a service availability should be exposed and propagated to parties that subscribes to the information. One potential way forward would be to combine WebFinger with XMPP or with Pubsubhubbub to propagate update in the WebFinger service.
