EVERYTHING BELOW IS OUTDATED!
=============================

Introduction
------------

This API has the following goals:
* Provide functionality to access the channel list and information like type and name of a channel.
* Switch between channels.
* Stop/start the broadcast.
* Access to the current parental rating of the broadcast.

This API builds on two existing approaches and merges both. The basis for this API is the HTML5 video element interface (HTMLVideoElement). The here specified interface HTMLTVElement extends the video element and provides the functionality necessary to achieve the mentioned goals on top of it. This added functionality is based on the Open IPTV Forum Release 2 Volume 5 Specification for Declarative Application Environment.

Example for a HTMLTVElement in HTML:
<pre><code class="html">

<video width="640" height="480" controls>
 <source src="tv">
</video>

</code></pre>
