System Authentication
=====================

How does the user authenticate "the system"? including devices, interfaces, etc.

More specifically - how does a user authenticate the personal zone hub and farm interfaces?

Personal zone hub
-----------------

### Authentication

The PZH web interface is authenticated to users through SSL certificates. This relies on a browser being able to interpret these certificates, as well as the user recognising the URL of their PZH. It also relies on the certificate matching this URL.

### Revocation

The PZH might be moved, and the original certificate ought to be revoked.

Webinos web runtime
