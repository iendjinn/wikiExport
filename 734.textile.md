Issues:
-------

### ID Management

-   Principle action: to document the key decision in the introduction section of the ID management deliverable will cover
    -   Identity of users/devices/apps
    -   Addressing model of the same
    -   fundamental architecture issues
    -   interface between application and identity module - served on PZX
    -   Responsibility delineation between WRT and application - with respect to authentication responsibilities
-   Security tradeoff between usability and security - ACTION to be framed as specific questions to address in 2.8 experimentation
-   Fundamental question outstanding on the dilema between discovery and privacy. to be documented formally and a problem for analysis

Nick status on user-ID: need to focus on deliverable

### Context Adaptation:

GeorgeG: following was done since Berlin
a) produced white-paper about â€œwebinos context modelâ€ linked on redmine. asks for feedback from Nick , Dave,
b) initial context related objects & relationships list on redmine
request for links to any related APIs (even-draft) from partners
c) need to decide on the context acquisition mechanism: GeorgeG: how are we going to make sure that no API/event is missed from context worl? (Andre: use Claes distributed list of aPIs on -ml). (Nick: recommends to add a redmine task for analysis each API with respect to Context)
GeorgeG: to producde relevant API analysis tasks on Redmine
d) Privacy: GG contact with John (Oxford) in progress in order to align work

### Privileged Apps:

-   Krishna: Priv. apps is updated within Policy mgmt API work
-   Christian: is there provision within project to deal with potential hacks into the Runtime Environmet. John Lyle: it will be down to the sys implementation, no work can be done now. Recommendations will be made in 3.5 work with respect to Run-time hack resilience.
-   open issue: Apps to be signed and confirmed by Device manuf. when using sensitive APIs and critical data
-   Any implications to Monitor Engine data? (i.e. to analytics/metering) John: this is well defined/understood, no need for further analysis work.
-   Crypto methods & code encryption: nothing to report

### Overlay Network model:

-   nothing to report at this point

### Policy Management:

-   Berlin identified issues still open: script packaging, device policy protection, remote management.
    John: thereâ€™s potential overlap in policy sync & ID management
    GeorgeG: whoâ€™s responsible for sync issue? Nick: distributed task for now , John has been doing work but specifics still under discussion.
    Stefano (ISMB): may we require that the implementation has a way to prevent garbage collection of JavaScript objects?

General phone conf call issues:
-------------------------------

Christian: everyone to provide recommendations/feedback on this way of running the conf calls.
(Nick: risk is that it implies that people will thoroughly read material.)
(Katrin recom: brief summary/update would help)
(Nick recom: force 2 mins max for activitiy update)
(Christian: to try hybrid short-update + open issues review conf call â€œstyleâ€ next week)
