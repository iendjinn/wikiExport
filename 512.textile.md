The application will be able to securely and consistently access device specific features, communicate over the cloud and adjust to the device and context specific situation.
-   _Widget_: An interactive application for displaying and/or updating local data or data on the Web, packaged in a way to allow a single download and installation on a user’s machine or mobile device [WAC].

2. Webinos Application Specification
====================================

This section is about specifying the technology behind webinos applications

Webinos Application
-------------------

A webinos application is defined as follows (citing D2.2):

<pre>
An application written using webinos technologies that will run on a device, across a range of devices reflecting the domains mobile,
fix, automotive or home media and/or server. The application will be able to securely and consistently access device specific features,
communicate over the cloud and adjust to the device and context specific situation.
</pre>

Webinos technologies adhere several existing and upcoming web technologies as well as webinos specific add-ons which enabling applications to be developed for multiple platforms including device feature access, transparent communication across devices, and secure application execution. The specific relevant web technologies to be used are referred in the dedicated sections of this document.

Packaging
---------

The core structure and content of webinos applications is defined through the W3C Widget Packaging and Configuration [Widgets] specification. Webinos application packaging adds some further features to this specification in order to meet additional requirements.

`The webinos WRT MUST be capable of processing widget packages as defined in [Widgets].`

`The webinos WRT MUST implement the URI scheme as defined in [WidgetURI] to address resources within webinos application packages.`

In addition to the XML elements defined in [Widgets] webinos applications are allowed to make use of some proprietary extensions. Therefore the following separate webinos specific XML namespace must be used to reference to webinos specific xml elements.

Webinos XML namespace: `http://www.webinos.org/webinosapplication`

The following elements are webinos specific extensions to the [Widgets] specification and must be supported by webinos WRTs.

### The `distributor` element

A distributor element represents people or an organization that distributed the instance of a webinos application. Commonly application stores are distributors.

Context in which this element is used: `As a child of the widget element.`
Content model: `Any.`
Occurrences: `Zero or one.`
Attributes: `href, email.`

`The email attribute represents an email address associated with the distributor. The email attribute is optional.`

`The href attribute represents an URI that associates with the distributor. The href attribute is optional.`

**Example of Usage:**
<pre><code class="xml">
<widget xmlns="http://www.w3.org/ns/widgets"
 xmlns:webinos="http://www.webinos.org/webinosapplication">
 <webinos:distributor name="Example Store" href="http://www.exemplarystore.com">
 <content src="widget.html"/>
</widget>
</code></pre>

### The `versionName` attribute of the `widget` element

A version name element represents the version of the application in a human readable manner. The versionName element is optional and is not used for application life cycle management.

**Example of Usage:**
<pre><code class="xml">
<widget xmlns="http://www.w3.org/ns/widgets"
 xmlns:webinos="http://www.webinos.org/webinosapplication"
 webinos:versionName="Silver">
 <content src="widget.html"/>
</widget>
</code></pre>

### The `expires` attribute of the `widget` element

-   delete / prohibit execution of application in case that a expiry data is reached

comprehensive description and example of use to be added

### The `multi-install` element and attributes

-   deploy parts or whole application on each device needed / or supported by the application (make the application automatically available on each device of the user)
-   multi-device element points to widget files located within the currently processed widget (e.g. ressource folder) which will be automatically installed on remote devices. How should be described on which device the specific widgets should be installed, can a simple feature match be sufficient?
-   look at section "Distributed Webinos Application" for exhaustive description of use

comprehensive description and example of use to be added

### The `shared-functions` element, sub elements and attributes

-   exposing JS functions of an application to allow other applications to use them
-   look at section "Exposing Functions to other Applications" for exhaustive description of use

comprehensive description and example of use to be added

### The `copy-protection` element

-   state that it is not allowed to copy/export/install the application on another device using webinos application sharing/advertisement features
-   should we make a difference between own devices and other devices?

comprehensive description and example of use to be added

### The `autostart` element (depends on the actual auto start approach whether it will be part of the configuration document or via an api)

-   automatic execution if certain events appear, e.g., pre-defined ones as on boot-up completed or application specific events (depends on event type definition of T3.2)
-   via application interface api this value could be set dynamically

comprehensive description and example of use to be added

Application Interface
---------------------

In [WidgetAPI] W3C defines an API to access application specific data defined in the applications configuration document and a persistence model. This API is used and extended to provide support for the webinos specific XML elements defined in this specification.

<pre><code class="javascript">
interface Widget {

//webinos specific attributes
 readonly attribute DOMString distributor;
 readonly attribute DOMString distributorEmail;
 readonly attribute DOMString distributorHref;

…others to be added…

//Widget standard attributes
 readonly attribute DOMString author;
 readonly attribute DOMString authorEmail;
 readonly attribute DOMString authorHref;
 readonly attribute DOMString description;
 readonly attribute DOMString id;
 readonly attribute DOMString name;
 readonly attribute DOMString shortName;
 readonly attribute Storage preferences;
 readonly attribute DOMString version;
 readonly attribute unsigned long height;
 readonly attribute unsigned long width;
};
</code></pre>

As shown in the Widget object interface description several webinos specific attributes are added. Following the meaning of each of the new attributes is described.

-   `distributor` attribute: The distributor attribute provides read only access to the distributor element’s content of the config.xml if available. Otherwise this attribute is NULL.
-   `distributorEmail` attribute: The distributorEmail attribute provides read only access to the distributor’s email adress if available. Otherwise this attribute is NULL.
-   `distributorHref` attribute: The distributorHref attribute provides read only access to the distributor’s URI reference if available. Otherwise this attribtue is NULL.

…others to be added…

The following specification for distributed webinos applications will add some further more complex extensions to the Widget application interface as well as to the Widget packaging and configuration specification.

Distributed Webinos Application
-------------------------------

Webinos allows the creation of multi-device applications not only from the execution environment point of view but also from the deployment point of view. Webinos allows developers to design their applications in a way that applications or only parts of them can be automatically deployed to other devices which are more suited for the execution of specific application code, e.g., due to application design, feature access or performance reasons. The webinos distributed application approach allows to package a number of sub-applications, i.e., child applications, within a main webinos application. The sub-applications are full webinos applications again also following the webinos application packaging specification but with attached meta data about its origin, i.e., its parent application, in order to enable simply communication schemes between parent and child applications or more concrete between instances of parent and child applications. Application code encapsulated in child applications should be code where the developer thinks that it makes sense to create specific application modules for certain tasks while the functionalities provided by the modules can be used by the parent application only or they can be shared between other applications. Thus, application distribution is not only about outsourcing code to other devices but also about using functionalities provided by one application across others.

### Use Case Examples

Following three illustrating examples of use:

**1 Smart Text Input:**

`Using a smart-phone as text input device for applications running on a TV set. Here, the smart phone not only sends key-codes to the â€œmainâ€ application, it also shows some appropriate forms in order to support the text input. In addition, the outsourced code running on the smart-phone may check the text input in order to prevent sending of unnecessary or incorrect data to the â€œmainâ€ application.`

**2 Smart sensors:**

`Assuming an application wants to be informed when remotely available sensor data (real sensor or any another webinos enable/compatible device) crosses a specific threshold. The application could check periodically the actual value and take some action based on this. Since this would produce unnecessary traffic and needs the primary application to run continuously, it would be better to only get a sensor event if the threshold is reached. To achieve this, the application may outsource a piece of code to the desired sensor or device. The code locally checks the sensor/requested data until the threshold is reached. The outsourced code informs the â€œmainâ€ application via an eventing system about this so that the application can take their specific actions.`

**3 Component sharing:**

`The Android Intent programming paradigm allows easy sharing of application components between other applications. For example a tiny applications is only designed for picking a location from a map and providing the attached geographic location for the selected map position. Since this task is common across multiple application it would be an ideal candidate for cross application sharing of services. Thus, the application is able to be invoked from other applications and could sent back the result to the calling application. Equal possibilities like these known from Android Intents could be provided to webinos applications by using the application distribution mechanisms not only for distributing applications but also for sharing application features. `

### Packaging

Applications which wanting to make use of webinos distributed application features have to explicitly declare components which should be made available in a distributed manner. In webinos two options for distributed applications are available:

-   An application is able to outsource an application component to another device to be executed remotely.
-   An application can share application components with other applications to allow reuse of existing code.

Both possibilities are further referred as distributed application component or as child application. Turned, a main application that provides distributable components is called a parent application. To declare code as being a distributed application component or a child application two steps are needed. The first is packaging the components which should be distributable and secondly declaring those components as being distributable within their attached application manifest files, i.e., the configuration document of each child application.
Packaging an application component for being distributable works exactly the same way as packaging a full webinos application. Thus, a child application could be a full webinos application itself as well as only a small application which only has a small single purpose.

`Note: In the current release webinos only supports pre-defined child applications which must be available in the parentâ€™s application package during application installation. Future versions may support the dynamic creation of application packages during application runtime by providing some appropriate APIs.`

All packaged child applications must be placed in the webinos specific â€˜componentsâ€™ folder which must be located in the root folder of the parentâ€™s application package. Exemplary application structure:

-   root
    -   config.xml
    -   app.html
    -   icon.png
    -   Scripts
        -   app.js
    -   Styles
        -   small.css
        -   big.css
    -   Components
        -   child1.wgt
        -   child2.wgt

The configuration document may have additional information about the applications remote deployment and function sharing behaviour. During installation of the parent application the configuration files of each child application located in the components folder and the parent application is processed as described in the next sections.

### Multi-Installation

**Automatic Deployment**

During installation of a parent application its child applications, if any, can be automatically installed on remote devices based on the information contained in the configuration document. To do so, the child application that should be installed on other devices must provide a multi-install element in the applicationâ€™s configuration document. This will trigger the webinos runtime to also install the related child application. If the element is absent no automatic deployment of the related child application will be processed.
Optionally the deployOnSameDevice attribute of the multi-install element can be set to â€œtrueâ€ in order to force installation on the same device as the parent application is installed.
Example of Usage:

<pre><code class="xml">
<widget xmlns="http://www.w3.org/ns/widgets"
 xmlns:webinos="http://www.webinos.org/webinosapplication"
 id=â€exampleIDâ€>
 <webinos:multi-install deployOnSameDevice=â€trueâ€ dependsOnParent="true"/>
 <content src="widget.html"/>
</widget>
</code></pre>

If the multi-install element is available and the deployOnSameDevice attribute is not set to â€œtrueâ€ the webinos runtime should provide a list of available devices to the user where the child applications can be installed on. In addition, information about the child application as available in the configuration document should be shown to the user. The user may select one, more or all available devices for installing the child application.
Afterwards the child application is installed on the selected devices via HTTP POST as proposed by the Apache Wookie Incubator project [Wookie]:

POST {deviceAddress}/widgets {file}

DeviceAddress is the addressable URI of the webinos runtime that should install the child application and file is the application package which is transported in the body part of the HTTP message. The target webinos runtime may ask the user for confirming the installation again.

The dependsOnParent attribute influences the child’s application life cycle (see also related section). If dependsOnParent is set to "true" all installed child application instances are automatically deleted if the parent application is removed, e.g., the child applications don’t provide any proper service if the parent application is not available.

`Note: In future versions more advanced automatic deployment mechanisms may be introduced which allowing stating a number of filters within the multi-install element of the configuration document in order to reduce the number of possible devices for installation.`

**On Request Deployment**

Beside of remote installation during installation of the parent application it is also possible to deploy code on demand at application runtime to make it permanently available on other devices. Therefore the Widget application interface is extended to provide deployment functionalities where an application ID can be used to specify which child should be deployed.
Following the WebIDL specification of the child deployment procedure:

<pre><code class="javascript">
typedef sequence<DOMString> StringArray;

[Callback=FunctionOnly, NoInterfaceObject] interface DeploymentSuccessCallback {
 //application references can be used to communicate with the application instance,
 //to start the instance, and to create â€œvirtualâ€ objects of the instance to use its
 //exposed functions
 void onsuccess(in DOMString childID, ApplicationRefArray applicationRef);
 };
[Callback=FunctionOnly, NoInterfaceObject] interface DeploymentErrorCallback {
 void onerror(in DOMString childID, in DeploymentError error);
 };
[NoInterfaceObject] interface DeploymentError {
 readonly attribute unsigned short code;
 readonly attribute DOMString message;
 const unsigned short UNKNOWN_ERR = 0;
 const unsigned short DEVICE_UNREACHABLE_ERR = 1;
 const unsigned short ABORT_BY_USER_ERR = 2;
 };

[Callback, NoInterfaceObject] interface DeploymentOptions {
 //the ID as defined in the configuration document of the child application, if null
 //each child application located in the components folder will be tried to deployed
 attribute DOMString childID;

//selection of devices where to install, if null the runtime provides a list of possible
 //to be checked with discovery group
 devices attribute WebinosDeviceArrayList devices;
};
interface Widget {
 void deployChild(in DeploymentSuccessCallback successCallback, in optional DeploymentErrorCallback errorCallback,
 in optional DeploymentOptions);
}
</code></pre>

### Interfacing between Child and Parent Applications

Since webinos supports a distributed application design the possibility of communication between application parts must be assured by the system. Webinos supports this by providing information about deployed child applications and accordingly information about the parent application for child applications.

the following approach is tentative and described on a high level, depends on id management and discovery thematic areas

For both application parts, parent and child applications, an application context API is provided as extension to the API defined in [WidgetAPI]. The extension provides information about the applications origin for child applications and about deploy child applications for parent applications. Using this API provides application references to child and parent applications to allow communication between application parts by providing addressing information for the notification and eventing system and also for the application execution mechanism in order to trigger the execution of application parts.

The addressing information provided can also be used to instantiate a JavaScript object binding to functions provided by the application parts as described in the next section "Exposing Functions to other Applications".

<pre><code class="javascript">
typedef sequence<Child> ChildArray;
typedef sequence<Parent> ParentArray;

[NoInterfaceObject] interface Child{
 //if any JavaScript functions are exposed they can be accessed via a child object that contains JS bindings between both application parts
 Object child.XXX;

//kind of information for addressing this application via the eventing system for communication or triggering execution
 Address address;
};

[NoInterfaceObject] interface Parent{
 //if any JavaScript functions are exposed they can be accessed via a child object that contains JS bindings between both application parts
 parent.XXX;

//kind of information for addressing this application via the eventing system for communication or triggering execution
 Address address;
};

[NoInterfaceObject] interface Context{
 //accessing all known children of an application / returns a list of children if any child were deployed, if no children are available the returned list is of length 0
 ChildArray getChildren();

//accessing the parent (if current application is a child otherwise null is returned which means no parent known)
 ParentArray getParent();
};

interface Widget {
 //accessing the application context
 Context getContext();
}
</code></pre>

### Exposing Functions to other Applications

As introduced in the beginning of this section webinos application may share its functionalities across other applications. To make functions available to others the shared-functions element containing a number of shared-function elements must be added to the applications configuration document. The content of the shared-function element must be a JavaScript function which should be accessible to other applications.
Example of Usage:

<pre><code class="xml">
<widget xmlns="http://www.w3.org/ns/widgets"
 xmlns:webinos="http://www.webinos.org/webinosapplication"
 id="exampleID">
 <webinos:shared-functions>
 <webinos:shared-function>function1</webinos:shared-function>
 <webinos:shared-function>function2</webinos:shared-function>
 </webinos:versionName>
 <content src="widget.html"/>
</widget>
</code></pre>

`Note: Only primitive data types can be exchanged using the webinos application function sharing feature. Support for complex data types like objects and functions might be added in future versions.`

The visibility of the shared functions can be restricted to be only accessible by a parent or child application. To define this, the visibility attribute of the shared-function element is used. For example:

`<webinos:shared-function visibility=â€parentâ€>function1</webinos:shared-function> allows only a parent application to access function1.`
`<webinos:shared-function visibility=â€childâ€>function2</webinos:shared-function> allows only a child application to access function2.`

To use functions exposed by webinos applications an application reference is needed. The reference provides information about the application and provides direct access to the exposed functions.
A reference to an application can be requested by calling Widget.getApplicationRef(String applicationID). The return type is a subset of the Widget Interface containing the application name, description, author, and version name beside of the invoke object which gives access to the functions exposed by the application. For example accessing function 1 from the above example would in JavaScript look like:

<pre><code class="javascript">
//get a reference to an application
widgetReference = Widget.getApplicationRef("exampleID");
//accessing and print out the name of the application
alert(widgetReference.name);
//invoking the function1 function
widgetReference.invoke.function1();
</code></pre>

It is important to understand that the actual signature of the functions as well as the function names of the exposed functions must be known by the developer. There is no mechanism that semantically describes the behaviour of the shared functions.

### Local Execution of remotely hosted Applications

-   accessing an application package on a remote device and execute it locally (like wookie)
-   appropriate for â€œone-timeâ€ usage without the need of installation
-   additional installation is possible ==> usage would need online connectivity (placing an icon in the widget gallery, thus, the user can access the application/hosted app at anytime / more or less a bookmark API with policy enforcement about used features)
-   allow to be the src attribute of the content element in the application configuration document to point to a destination outside of the application package
-   in case that the src attribute points to a location outside the wgt package there is no need to include any other content in the package (but is still possible => local and remote content)
-   install a hosted application works the same as installing a packaged webinos web application (providing the .wgt file to the runtime)

<pre><code class="xml">
<widget xmlns="http://www.w3.org/ns/widgets">
 <content src="http://www.hostedapps.com/hostedApp1.html"/>
</widget>
</code></pre>

-   in addition a hosted app must define which locations are parts of the application in order to allow access to documents which are hosted there and to manage policies
-   use Widget Access Request Policy [WARP] to define to which locations the hosted app should have access to

<pre><code class="xml">
<widget xmlns="http://www.w3.org/ns/widgets">
 <content src="http://www.hostedapps.com/hostedApp1/run.html"/>
 <access origin="http://www.hostedapps.com/hostedApp1/"/>
</widget>
</code></pre>

3. Webinos Web Runtime Environment Specification
================================================

…

Webinos Web Runtime
-------------------

-   User Agent Identification containing vendor, name, version of WRT identifying available features provided by the WRT
-   provide possibilities to install an existing application from one device/runtime to another device/runtime using application Push (as also described in section 2 multi-installation) whereas the discovery has to provide possibilities to detect a "push-able" endpoint

Application Life Cycle
----------------------

Webinos applications can be made available through a number of different approaches including installation via web sites, application stores, file system, other webinos web runtimes, simple application sharing and application advertisement, and execution of hosted applications (no installation). Upon installation of a webinos application package the web runtime must process the package as specified in section 2 of this specification.

`If possible the webinos WRT MUST catch content which is of MIME type application/widget in order to install the application or execute the application if already installed and up to date.`

`If possible the webinos WRT MUST catch the invocation of files with a .wgt extension in order to install the application or execute the application if already installed and up to date.`

`The WRT MAY check the applications configuration document for compatibility with the features provided by the runtime.`

`The WRT MUST provide means to install locally available applications on another device which can be selected by the user in conformance with section 2 of this specification.`

`The WRT MUST provide a list of application available to the user for local installation or remote usage.`

`The WRT MUST delete all data specific to an application if the application is uninstalled. This includes the uninstallation of any child applications if they are depended on the parent application.`

-   what happens if a child application is deleted / should there be an event for the parent application or can get information about it be part of Widget.GetContext()?

### Application Update

[WidgetUpdate] defines how packaged web applications (Widgets) can be updated over http.

`The webinos WRT MUST be capable of updating webinos application packages in the same way as defined for W3C widgets in [WidgetUpdate].`

-   how to update distributed applications / child applications is to be defined but should be also modelled using [WidgetUpdate].
-   for hosted web applications without any content in the .wgt package there is no need for updates (all updates happening remotely "in the internet") and are applied with the next execution of the hosted application

### Automatic execution of Applications

-   application should be able to be automatically launched if certain events occurring
-   webinos defines application execution APIs in 3.2 but its open if it is really needed? (referring WAC 2.8 URIs) We could mandate, that WRTs must be able to trigger applications on specific events (Messeging/Notification APIs) thus there is no need for a specific "subscribe for application execution API" (in such an API applications could register itself and a related event (notification/messaging/event API in 3.2) that must occur to be automatically executed)
-   previous (implementation specific user driven) works only if the user may decided under which circumstance an application should be executed - applications could define its start-up preconditions via config.xml where an event type is given. Thus apps could automatically executed for predefined webinos events or for application specific ones (application part A needs that part B is also running (which could be on another device))
-   events can be application specific ones or predefine webinos events like "on boot completed"

### Background and no UI Applications

-   webinos application can be in a no UI / invisible mode
-   specify how to access/manage applications running in the background (mostly possibility to start and stop those application => runtime requirements)
-   do we have webinos runtimes without UI/GUI? how to manage application life cycle there?

### Pre-Installation Meta Data provisioning

-   define a protocol that allows to access the webinos application package’s meta data before downloading the whole package
-   ==> this is maybe not needed if we assume that application stores will have their own application store clients running on the user’s devices. The clients could check available features locally and communicate with store back-end. Thus, store clients could not connect to multiple store back-ends unless their are proprietary protocols for describing the local device capabilities.

Web Technologies
----------------

`Note: The following section is preliminary and may be subject to change in future versions of the specification.`

A Web runtime which is able to render webinos applications and wants to claim to be compliant to the webinos specification must support following web technologies wheras the concrete mandatory version and feature set of each one is further defined in the Wholesale Application Community Core Specification Version 2.0 Section 2 [WACWebTech].

-   XML and HTML Markup Language
-   JavaScript (JS)
-   Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)
-   XmlHttpRequest
-   Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG)

Beside of the definition of web technologies to be supported [WACWebTech] defines URI schemes to allow launching of specific applications. The following URI schemes must be supported by webinos runtimes:

-   "http/https" in order to launch a web browser
-   "tel" in order to initiate a call
-   "sms" in order to send a short message service (SMS) message
-   "mmsto" in order to send a multimedia massaging service (MMS) message
-   "mailto" in order to send an email message
-   "data" in order to directly embed content (e.g., data:image/jpeg;base64,/9j/4AAQSkZJRgABAQAAA…)

Security and Privacy
--------------------

-   The webinos WRT MUST support the [WidgetDigSig] specification in order to verify the author and/or distributor of the application.?
-   The webinos WRT MUST support application network access control as defined in the Widget Access Request Policy [WARP].?
-   referencing other 3.1/3.2/3.5 work (how equal will it be to WAC?)
-   secure storage of webinos applications which does not allow to view, export, modify, or any other access to the application by other applications or the user (WAC).
-   encrypted storage of webinos applications in case that external or general accessible storage space is used (WAC).
-   allow export webinos application/install on other device if copy protection flag is not set?
-   allow export webinos application/install on other device if copy protection flag is set but the other terminal belongs also to the user?
