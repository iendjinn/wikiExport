D036 Remote Management
======================

Outline of requirements
-----------------------

-   _Remote management provisioning_ - "webinos shall facilitate the provisioning of remote webinos components necessary to enable personal device management"
-   _Personal device management_ - "The webinos runtime shall include interfaces to allow end-users to manage the interactions between their personal devices."
-   _Application data synchronisation management_ - "webinos shall allow users to manage applications which synchronise their data with other webinos devices."
-   _Policy management_ - "webinos shall allow users to view and manage application policies."
-   _Access control log_ - "webinos shall allow access control decisions to be logged."

This justifies that webinos should be able to do the following from a PZH web interface:
* Revocation (see earlier sections)
* Remote wiping of application data

In addition, we can consider the following:
* intrusion detection
* "phone home" functionality
* personal zone hub migration between farms

This section should clearly delineate between functionality we want and functionality we have already implemented
