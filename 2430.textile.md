Related Academic Work
---------------------

This section covers the key related academic material and concludes with an explanation for how these have been taken into account in the webinos security framework.

### Papers

#### Exposing additional capabilities to web browsers

The Gibraltar system ([[D036_References#Gibraltar|Gibraltar]]) takes a similar approach to webinos in exposing device-level capabilities to web browsers. This work takes a capability approach (issuing tokens to trusted sites) in contrast to the policy-based system implemented in webinos.

#### Cross-device synchronisation

The Cloudberry system ([[D036_References#Cloudberry|Cloudberry]]) is related to webinos but is more cloud-driven.

#### Access control, permissions and API security

-   "How to ask for Permission" ([[D036_References#PorterFelt2012|PorterFelt2012]])
-   "Android Permissions: User Attention, Comprehension, and Behavior" ([[D036_References#PorterFelt2012b|PorterFelt2012b]])
-   "The Effectiveness of Application Permissions" ([[D036_References#PorterFelt2012c|PorterFelt2012c]])

-   "Privilege Separation in HTML5 Applications" ([[D036_References#Akhawe2012|Akhawe2012]])

#### Web Browsers

-   The Gazelle Web Browser ([[D036_References#Wang2009|Wang2009]])
-   The Tahoma Web Browser ([[D036_References#Cox2006|Cox2006]])
-   FlowFox ([[D036_References#DeGrouf2012|DeGrouf2012]])

#### Mobile Malware

-   An analysis of Android malware is presented in ([[D036_References#Zhou2012|Zhou2012]])
-   A wider survey of mobile malware can be found in ([[D036_References#PorterFelt2011|PorterFelt2011]])

#### Principles and Design patterns

-   Chapter 10 of ([[D036_References#Garfinkel2005|Garfinkel2005]]), and an analysis of their application to the web by The University of Oxford ([[D036_References#LyleBlog2012|LyleBlog2012]]).
-   We aim to avoid the Privacy Pitfalls described by Lederer et al. ([[D036_References#Lederer04|Lederer04]])
-   We also aim to follow the principles outlined in the classic Saltzer and Schroeder paper ([[D036_References#Saltzer75|Saltzer75]]).

More details of our guiding principles are available in the D3.5 deliverable.

### Workshops

W3C API Security and Privacy Workshops from 2010 and 2008

-   ([[D036_References#W3CApiSec|W3CApiSec]])
-   ([[D036_References#W3CApiPriv|W3CApiPriv]])

### Recommendations for webinos

-   The principle of least privilege should be followed through the policy architecture.
-   Motivations and attacks based on existing mobile malware should be fed into risk analysis.
-   Recommendations for web application based on the Google Chrome Extension Security Architecture should be considered as part of the security architecture.
-   Garfinkelâ€™s design patterns - install before execute - are relevant for webinos.
-   We recommend the use of status icons ("Sensor Widgets") based on the Gibraltar paper for consideration as a future webinos security control.
