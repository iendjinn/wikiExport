Node.js Addons
==============

Node.js is a server-side JavaScript environment that uses an asynchronous event-driven model.
Addons are dynamically linked shared objects. They can provide glue to C and C++ libraries.

How it works
------------

### From a Node.js app developer perspective

The app developer in Node.js generally does not need much information about the addons. The addon can be used as by requiri
<pre>
<code class="Javascript">
var extension = require(./extension);
extension.doSomething();
</code>
</pre>

### From a Node.js addon developer perspective

Addons in Node.js add functionality to the V8 JavaScript engine. Building native addons in Node.js requires the knowledge of several libraries
* V8 JavaScript, a C++ library. Used for interfacing with JavaScript: creating objects, calling functions, etc. Documented mostly in the v8.h header file (deps/v8/include/v8.h in the Node source tree).
* libev, C event loop library. Anytime one needs to wait for a file descriptor to become readable, wait for a timer, or wait for a signal to received one will need to interface with libev. That is, if you perform any I/O, libev will need to be used. Node uses the EV_DEFAULT event loop. Documentation can be found http:/cvs.schmorp.de/libev/ev.html.
* libeio, C thread pool library. Used to execute blocking POSIX system calls asynchronously. Mostly wrappers already exist for such calls, in src/file.cc so you will probably not need to use it. If you do need it, look at the header file deps/libeio/eio.h.
Internal Node libraries. Most importantly is the node::ObjectWrap class which you will likely want to derive from.
Others. Look in deps/ for what else is available

All Node addons must export a function called init with this signature:
<pre>
<code class="C">
extern ‘C’ void init (Handle<Object> target)
</code>
</pre>
