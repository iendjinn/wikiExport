Methodology
===========

The methodology for deriving the specification was based on the waterfall model.

In the initial step, a long list of scenarios and user stories involving a web application platform were defined (see also Deliverable 2.1).

From these scenarios and user stories, a sub-set was selected, representing advanced, innovative and typical usage.

Based on these representative scenarios, which were mainly informal descriptions of applications and their usage, use cases were derived, which describe the interaction between the actors and the software in a more formalized way. From these use cases, requirements pertaining to the underlying platform, and including security requirements, were extracted (see also Deliverable D2.2). This process ignored requirements that were application specific, unless they implied requirements for the underlying platform.

Following this phase, the requirements(derived from presumed representative scenarios) were checked against the original set of scenarios and user stories to ensure that no requirements were missed.

Based on these requirements, together with known requirements from other web application platform work performed by project partners (such as W3C, BONDI, WAC or OIPF) the webinos specification was developed. Since it is unpredictable what features a future application, utilizing the platform, might require, the set of requirements for a platform can never be complete. However, basing the requirements on a wide range of innovative scenarios, combined with the experience of the project members and external feedback, should result in a specification that fills the most crucial currently foreseeable needs and remains open for adaption to future needs.

This anticipated adaptation for future needs will be covered in the webinos project in Phase 2, which will review, revise and refine the specification in this document. The development of the platform and applications will serve as proof-of-concept and will provide valuable feedback for Phase 2 enhancement of the specifications.

Guidelines
----------

When drafting the specification, webinos project members took a number of guidelines into account:

**Donâ€™t re-invent the wheel**

Where solutions in an area already existed and were found valuable and acceptable, these were utilized and adapted as far as possible and needed. There was a strong bias in the project against innovating for the sake of innovating. Existing solutions, standards and specifications were referenced and re-used. If existing solutions were almost sufficient, but not meeting webinos requirements in all details, care was taken to do only the smallest number of changes, needed to fulfill the requirements.

**Consider licensing issues**

If available and appropriate, the specifications are based on open standards to avoid the specification and subsequent implementations to be encumbered by legal and licensing issues, hindering adoption. In areas where only proprietary standards were available or dominating, care was taken to provide specifications in a way to allow implementation independently of proprietary solutions, but, if possible, stay close enough to them to allow easy mapping to such solutions to allow their usage in environments where these are ubiquitous.

**Be secure by design**

To avoid the common risk of developing an architecture and a specification solely on functional requirements and then tagging on security as an afterthought, webinos has a specific task dedicated to developing a security and policy framework and integrating it into the architecture from the beginning. Unlike other parts of the specification work package, which operate in two distinct phases, the security task runs continuously across the project life time to ensure that security and policy concerns can be addressed quickly and sufficiently.

**Be developer friendly**

The key for success of a platform is the acceptance by developers. To achieve this, webinos needs to provide features to allow developers faster, more attractive and more efficient development - of applications that can communicate and use resources across devices and apps. Whilst current platforms provide access to local hardware and other resources, they do not provide an infrastructure and significant support for multi-device usage. Communication, cooperation and sharing between apps and devices currently need to be provided by the developer.

To make life easier for developers, webinos considers not only the API on the device itself (covered in deliverable 3.2), but also a supporting infrastructure for, among others, user ID management, discovery (of devices, applications and services), event handling across devices, metrics and context handling. webinos seeks to provide the developers and service providers with a common non-proprietary infrastructure enabling or simplifying the use of resources between applications (also across different developers).

Work Areas
----------

To create the first specification of the webinos platform, based on the requirements and following the guidelines, fifteen work groups were created initially - tasked to analyze existing solutions, issues and remaining gaps in respect to the requirements.

As a result of this initial work, some overlap between the areas was detected and the groups were restructured to avoid duplication of work and unnecessary communication overhead. (As an example: Whilst the scope and problem space of the groups _Application/Service Discovery_ and _Device Discovery_ differed, the similarities of these groups were larger and consequently, the two groups were combined.)

Work then continued in ten work areas for which specifications were defined, which led to the Overlay Network Architecture and the seven specification areas contained in this deliverable. (For better structuring of the deliverable, two of the smaller areas, _Web application packaging/handling_ and _Extension Handling_ were combined in the _Foundations_ section; _Privileged Applications_ became part of the _Policy_ chapter, reducing the ten work areas to eight sections of the specification.)

The purpose of splitting the effort into different, mostly disjunct, work areas was to be able to work in small teams, often based in only one or two companies, to allow fast and efficient work and communication within the work areas. To avoid the risk of company bias and to ensure the fitting in of the individual areas into the overall concept of webinos, alignment and "bringing the pieces together" was assured through regular conference calls, cross-team workings and through final peer review across the teams.
