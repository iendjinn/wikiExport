Peer to Peer Communications with LLCP
=====================================

_**What if multiple devices come in range? Do we get multiple calls for the success method set by peer()? How do you detect when a message channel closes? Presumably, there is no need for an unpeer method, as you simply need to stop the port, right? However, there is scope for a method to cancel waiting for peering.**_

The Link Logical Control Protocol (LLCP) can be used to set up an HTML Message Channel for a temporary bidirectional aysnchronous connection. Message Channels are part of HTML5

-   "HTML5 MessageChannel":http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/comms.html

Here is a simple example:

<pre class="javascript prettyprint">
 // first set phone into peering mode
 Webinos.nfc.peer(success, fail);

function success (channel)
{
 console.log("successfully initiated peering mode");

// to send a message to the other device
 channel.port1.postMessage(‘hello’);

// to receive a message from the other device
 // first you set a message handler
 channel.port1.onmessage = handleMessage;

// you next instruct the channel to dispatch events
 // you can later close the port with the stop() method
 // your device then reverts to its normal mode
 channel.port1.start();
}

function handleMessage(event)
{
 // message is in event.data
 // …
}

// after a time out when peering couldn’t be established
function fail ()
{
 console.log("failed to initiate peering mode");
}
</pre>
