ESAPI OWASP top 10 coverage
===========================

A1 Injection
------------

### Encoder

Contains a number of methods for decoding input and encoding output so that it will be safe for a variety of interpreters. Validator implementations should call canonicalize on user input before validating to prevent encoded attacks.

<pre>
java.lang.String canonicalize(java.lang.String input, boolean restrictMultiple, boolean restrictMixed)
 Canonicalization is simply the operation of reducing a possibly encoded string down to its simplest form.
 Parameters:
 input - the text to canonicalize
 restrictMultiple - true if checking for multiple encoding is desired, false otherwise
 restrictMixed - true if checking for mixed encoding is desired, false otherwise
 Returns:
 a String containing the canonicalized text
</pre>

All of the methods must use a "whitelist" or "positive" security model. For the encoding methods, this means that all characters should be encoded, except for a specific list of "immune" characters that are known to be safe.
Encoding and decoding functions rely on a set of codecs that can be found in the org.owasp.esapi.codecs package. These include: CSS Escaping, HTMLEntity Encoding, JavaScript Escaping, MySQL Escaping, Oracle Escaping, Percent Encoding (aka URL Encoding), Unix Escaping, VBScript Escaping, Windows Encoding.

<pre>
java.lang.String encodeForCSS(java.lang.String input)

java.lang.String encodeForHTML(java.lang.String input)
java.lang.String decodeForHTML(java.lang.String input)

java.lang.String encodeForBase64(byte[] input, boolean wrap)
byte[] decodeFromBase64(java.lang.String input)

java.lang.String encodeForURL(java.lang.String input)
java.lang.String decodeFromURL(java.lang.String input)

java.lang.String encodeForHTMLAttribute(java.lang.String input)

java.lang.String encodeForJavaScript(java.lang.String input)

java.lang.String encodeForOS(Codec codec, java.lang.String input)
 Encode for an operating system command shell according to the selected codec (appropriate codecs include the WindowsCodec and UnixCodec).

java.lang.String encodeForSQL(Codec codec, java.lang.String input)
 Encode input for use in a SQL query, according to the selected codec (appropriate codecs include the MySQLCodec and OracleCodec).

java.lang.String encodeForXML(java.lang.String input)

java.lang.String encodeForXMLAttribute(java.lang.String input)

java.lang.String encodeForXPath(java.lang.String input)
</pre>

### Validator

Defines a set of methods for canonicalizing and validating untrusted input.

<pre>
Parameters:
 context - A descriptive name of the parameter that you are validating (e.g., LoginPage_UsernameField). This value is used by any logging or error handling that is done with respect to the value passed in.
 input - The actual user input data to validate.
 format - Required formatting of date inputted.
 type - The regular expression name that maps to the actual regular expression from "ESAPI.properties".
 maxLength - The maximum post-canonicalized String length allowed.
 allowNull - If allowNull is true then an input that is NULL or an empty string will be legal. If allowNull is false then NULL or an empty String will throw a ValidationException.

errorList captures ValidationExceptions

java.lang.String getValidCreditCard(java.lang.String context, java.lang.String input, boolean allowNull, ValidationErrorList errorList)

java.util.Date getValidDate(java.lang.String context, java.lang.String input, java.text.DateFormat format, boolean allowNull, ValidationErrorList errorList)

</pre>

A2 Cross site scripting (XSS)
-----------------------------

### Encoder and Validator

See A1.

A3 Broken authentication and sessions
-------------------------------------

### Authenticator

Defines a set of methods for generating and handling account credentials and session identifiers.
One possible implementation relies on the use of a thread local variable to store the current user’s identity. The application is responsible for calling setCurrentUser as soon as possible after each HTTP request is received. The value of getCurrentUser is used in several other places in this API. This eliminates the need to pass a user object to methods throughout the library. For example, all of the logging, access control, and exception calls need access to the currently logged in user.

<pre>
User getCurrentUser()
 Returns the matching User object, or the Anonymous User if no match exists

void setCurrentUser(User user)
 Sets the currently logged in User.
</pre>

login method should be called for every HTTP request, to login the current user either from the session of HTTP request. This method will set the current user so that getCurrentUser will work properly. Authenticates the user’s credentials from the HttpServletRequest if necessary, creates a session if necessary, and sets the user as the current user.

<pre>
User login(javax.servlet.http.HttpServletRequest request, javax.servlet.http.HttpServletResponse response)
 throws AuthenticationException
 Parameters:
 request - the current HTTP request
 response - the HTTP response
 Returns:
 the User
 Throws:
 AuthenticationException - if the credentials are not verified, or if the account is disabled, locked, expired, or timed out

void logout()
 Logs out the current user. This is usually done by calling User.logout on the current User.

</pre>

### User

Represents an application user or user account.
A user account can be in one of several states. When first created, a User should be disabled, not expired, and unlocked. To start using the account, an administrator should enable the account. The account can be locked for a number of reasons, most commonly because they have failed login for too many times. Finally, the account can expire after the expiration date has been reached. The User must be enabled, not expired, and unlocked in order to pass authentication.

<pre>
void disable()
 Disable this user’s account.

void enable()
 Enable this user’s account.

java.util.Date getExpirationTime()
 Returns the date that this user’s account will expire.

boolean isEnabled()
 Checks if this user’s account is currently enabled.

boolean isExpired()
 Checks if this user’s account is expired.

boolean isLocked()
 Checks if this user’s account is locked.

boolean isLoggedIn()
 Tests to see if the user is currently logged in.

void lock()
 Lock this user’s account.

void unlock()
 Unlock this user’s account.

void logout()
 Logout this user.

void setExpirationTime(java.util.Date expirationTime)
 Sets the date and time when this user’s account will expire.

</pre>

### HTTPUtilities

Is a collection of methods that provide additional security related to HTTP requests, responses, sessions, cookies, headers, and logging.

<pre>
void addCookie(javax.servlet.http.HttpServletResponse response, javax.servlet.http.Cookie cookie)
 Add a cookie to the response after ensuring that there are no encoded or illegal characters in the name and name and value. This method also sets the secure and HttpOnly flags on the cookie.

void addHeader(javax.servlet.http.HttpServletResponse response, java.lang.String name, java.lang.String value)
 Add a header to the response after ensuring that there are no encoded or illegal characters in the name and name and value.

void assertSecureRequest(javax.servlet.http.HttpServletRequest request)
 throws AccessControlException
 Ensures that the request uses both SSL and POST to protect any sensitive parameters in the querystring from being sniffed, logged, bookmarked, included in referer header, etc… This method should be called for any request that contains sensitive data from a web form.

void assertSecureChannel(javax.servlet.http.HttpServletRequest request)
 throws AccessControlException
 Ensures the use of SSL to protect any sensitive parameters in the request and any sensitive data in the response. This method should be called for any request that contains sensitive data from a web form or will result in sensitive data in the response page.

java.lang.String getCookie(javax.servlet.http.HttpServletRequest request, java.lang.String name)
 throws ValidationException
 A safer replacement for getCookies() in HttpServletRequest that returns the canonicalized value of the named cookie after "global" validation against the general type defined in ESAPI.properties. This should not be considered a replacement for more specific validation.

javax.servlet.http.HttpServletRequest getCurrentRequest()
 Retrieves the current HttpServletRequest

javax.servlet.http.HttpServletResponse getCurrentResponse()
 Retrieves the current HttpServletResponse

java.lang.String getHeader(javax.servlet.http.HttpServletRequest request, java.lang.String name)
 throws ValidationException
 A safer replacement for getHeader() in HttpServletRequest that returns the canonicalized value of the named header after "global" validation against the general type defined in ESAPI.properties. This should not be considered a replacement for more specific validation.

void logHTTPRequest(javax.servlet.http.HttpServletRequest request, Logger logger, java.util.List parameterNamesToObfuscate)
 Format the Source IP address, URL, URL parameters, and all form parameters into a string suitable for the log file. The list of parameters to obfuscate should be specified in order to prevent sensitive information from being logged. If a null list is provided, then all parameters will be logged. If HTTP request logging is done in a central place, the parameterNamesToObfuscate could be made a configuration parameter. We include it here in case different parts of the application need to obfuscate different parameters.

void setHeader(javax.servlet.http.HttpServletResponse response, java.lang.String name, java.lang.String value)
 Add a header to the response after ensuring that there are no encoded or illegal characters in the name and value.

void setNoCacheHeaders(javax.servlet.http.HttpServletResponse response)
 Set headers to protect sensitive information against being cached in the browser. Developers should make this call for any HTTP responses that contain any sensitive data that should not be cached within the browser or any intermediate proxies or caches. Implementations should set headers for the expected browsers. The safest approach is to set all relevant headers to their most restrictive setting. These include:
 Cache-Control: no-store
 Cache-Control: no-cache
 Cache-Control: must-revalidate
 Expires: -1
</pre>

h2. A4 Insecure Direct Object Reference

h3. AccessReferenceMap

Is used to map from a set of internal direct object references to a set of indirect references that are safe to disclose publicly. This can be used to help protect database keys, filenames, and other types of direct object references.
Indirect references are handled as strings, to facilitate their use in HTML.

<pre>
ava.util.Iterator iterator()
 Get an iterator through the direct object references. No guarantee is made as to the order of items returned.

<T> K getIndirectReference(T directReference)
 Get a safe indirect reference to use in place of a potentially sensitive direct object reference. Developers should use this call when building URL’s, form fields, hidden fields, etc… to help protect their private implementation information.

<T> T getDirectReference(K indirectReference)
 throws AccessControlException
 Get the original direct object reference from an indirect reference. Developers should use this when they get an indirect reference from a request to translate it back into the real direct reference. If an invalid indirect reference is requested, then an AccessControlException is thrown. If a type is implied the requested object will be cast to that type, if the object is not of the requested type, a AccessControlException will be thrown to the caller.

<T> K addDirectReference(T direct)
 Adds a direct reference to the AccessReferenceMap, then generates and returns an associated indirect reference.

<T> K removeDirectReference(T direct)
 throws AccessControlException
 Removes a direct reference and its associated indirect reference from the AccessReferenceMap.

void update(java.util.Set directReferences)
 Updates the access reference map with a new set of direct references, maintaining any existing indirect references associated with items that are in the new list. New indirect references could be generated every time, but that might mess up anything that previously used an indirect reference, such as a URL parameter.

</pre>

h3. AccessController

isAuthorizedForData, isAuthorizedForFile and isAuthorizedForFunction methods can be called to check if the current user is authorized to access the referenced data, file or function.

<pre>
boolean isAuthorizedForFunction(java.lang.String functionName)
 Checks if the current user is authorized to access the referenced function.

boolean isAuthorizedForData(java.lang.String action, java.lang.Object data)
 Checks if the current user is authorized to access the referenced data, represented as an Object.

boolean isAuthorizedForFile(java.lang.String filepath)
 Checks if the current user is authorized to access the referenced file.

</pre>

h2. A5 Cross Site Request Forgery (CSRF)

h3. USER (crsftoken)

Represents an application user or user account.
Methods getCSRFToken and resetCSRFToken are used.
CRSF token is used as a prevention against CSRF attacks. This token should be added to all links and forms. The application should verify that all requests contain the token, or they may have been generated by a CSRF attack. It is generally best to perform the check in a centralized location, either a filter or controller.

<pre>
java.lang.String getCSRFToken()
 Gets the CSRF token for this user’s current sessions.

java.lang.String resetCSRFToken()
 throws AuthenticationException
 Returns a token to be used as a prevention against CSRF attacks.

</pre>

verifyCSRFToken is a HTTPUtilities method.

<pre>
void verifyCSRFToken()
 Calls verifyCSRFToken with the current request.

void verifyCSRFToken(javax.servlet.http.HttpServletRequest request)
 throws IntrusionException
 Checks the CSRF token in the URL against the user’s CSRF token and throws an IntrusionException if it is missing.

</pre>

h3. AccessReferenceMap

Using random strings as indirect object references, makes it impossible for an attacker to guess valid identifiers. So if per-user AccessReferenceMaps are used, then request forgery (CSRF) attacks will also be prevented.

h2. A6 Security Misconfiguration

Security hardening is a server side task, so ESAPI doesn’t address this problem.


h2. A7 Insecure Cryptographic storage

h3. Encryptor

Provides a set of methods for performing common encryption, random number, and hashing operations.
Encryptor.MasterKey and Encryptor.MasterSalt must be set before using ESAPI encryption.

<pre>
java.lang.String hash(java.lang.String plaintext, java.lang.String salt, int iterations)
 throws EncryptionException
 Returns a string representation of the hash of the provided plaintext and salt. The salt helps to protect against a rainbow table attack by mixing in some extra data with the plaintext. Some good choices for a salt might be an account name or some other string that is known to the application but not to an attacker. See this article for more information about hashing as it pertains to password schemes.


CipherText encrypt(PlainText plaintext)
 Encrypts the provided plaintext bytes using the cipher transformation specified by the property Encryptor.CipherTransformation and the master encryption key as specified by the property Encryptor.MasterKey as defined in the ESAPI.properties file.


CipherText encrypt(javax.crypto.SecretKey key, PlainText plaintext)
 throws EncryptionException
 Encrypts the provided plaintext bytes using the cipher transformation specified by the property Encryptor.CipherTransformation as defined in the ESAPI.properties file and the specified secret key.
 This method is similar to encrypt(PlainText) except that it permits a specific SecretKey to be used for encryption.

PlainText decrypt(CipherText ciphertext)
 throws EncryptionException
 Decrypts the provided CipherText using the information from it and the master encryption key as specified by the property Encryptor.MasterKey as defined in the ESAPI.properties file.

PlainText decrypt(javax.crypto.SecretKey key, CipherText ciphertext)
 throws EncryptionException
 Decrypts the provided CipherText using the information from it and the specified secret key.
 This decrypt method is similar to decrypt(CipherText) except that it allows decrypting with a secret key other than the master secret key.

java.lang.String sign(java.lang.String data)
 throws EncryptionException
 Create a digital signature for the provided data and return it in a string.
 Limitations: A new public/private key pair used for ESAPI 2.0 digital signatures with this method and verifySignature(String, String) are dynamically created when the default reference implementation class, JavaEncryptor is first created. Because this key pair is not persisted nor is the public key shared, this method and the corresponding verifySignature(String, String) can not be used with expected results across JVM instances. This limitation will be addressed in ESAPI 2.1.

boolean verifySignature(java.lang.String signature, java.lang.String data)
 Verifies a digital signature (created with the sign method) and returns the boolean result.

NOTE: There is a bash shell script provided with the standard ESAPI distribution called ’setMasterKey.sh’ that will assist the user in setting Encryptor.MasterKey and Encryptor.MasterSalt properties. The script is in ’src/examples/scripts/setMasterKey.sh’.

</pre>

h2. A8 Failure to restrict URL access

h3. AccessController

Defines a set of methods that can be used to enforce access control. Provides access control for URLs, business functions, data, services, and files.
Needs to access the current User object (from Authenticator.getCurrentUser()) to determine roles or permissions.
e.g. isAuthorized method returns true if the AccessControlRule decides that the operation should be allowed. Otherwise, it returns false.

see A4
<pre>
boolean isAuthorized(java.lang.Object key, java.lang.Object runtimeParameter)
 isAuthorized executes the AccessControlRule that is identified by key and listed in the resources/ESAPI-AccessControlPolicy.xml file. It returns true if the AccessControlRule decides that the operation should be allowed. Otherwise, it returns false. Any exception thrown by the AccessControlRule must result in false. If key does not map to an AccessControlRule, then false is returned. Developers should call isAuthorized to control execution flow.
 Parameters:
 key- key maps to <AccessControlPolicy><AccessControlRules> <AccessControlRule name="key"
 runtimeParameter - runtimeParameter can contain anything that the AccessControlRule needs from the runtime system.
 Returns:
 Returns true if and only if the AccessControlRule specified by key exists and returned true. Otherwise returns false

</pre>

A9 Insufficient Transport Layer Protection
------------------------------------------

### HTTPUtilities (secure cookie)

encryptStateInCookie and decryptStateFromCookie are used to encrypt/decrypt cookies to prevent data exposure.

SSL/TLS use is a server architectural decision, so it is not addressed by ESAPI.

<pre>
java.util.Map<java.lang.String,java.lang.String> decryptStateFromCookie(javax.servlet.http.HttpServletRequest request)
 throws EncryptionException
 Retrieves a map of data from a cookie encrypted with encryptStateInCookie().

void encryptStateInCookie(javax.servlet.http.HttpServletResponse response, java.util.Map<java.lang.String,java.lang.String> cleartext)
 throws EncryptionException
 Stores a Map of data in an encrypted cookie.

</pre>

A10 Unvalid Redirects and Forwards
----------------------------------

### SecurityWrapperResponse

Overrides unsafe methods in the HttpServletResponse API with safe versions.
sendRedirect method generates a redirect response that can only be used to redirect the browser to safe locations, as configured in the ESAPI security configuration.
This method does not rely on information contained within redirect requests, and does not include sensitive information in a redirect.

<pre>
public void sendRedirect(java.lang.String location)
 throws java.io.IOException
 This method generates a redirect response that can only be used to redirect the browser to safe locations, as configured in the ESAPI security configuration.
</pre>

2007: A3 Malicious file execution
---------------------------------

### HTTPUtilities (upload)

getFileUploads method must check the content to ensure that it is safe before making a permanent copy on the local filesystem. Checks should include length and content checks, possibly virus checking, and path and name checks.

<pre>
java.util.List getFileUploads(javax.servlet.http.HttpServletRequest request, java.io.File destinationDir, java.util.List allowedExtensions)
 throws ValidationException
 Extract uploaded files from a multipart HTTP requests. Implementations must check the content to ensure that it is safe before making a permanent copy on the local filesystem. Checks should include length and content checks, possibly virus checking, and path and name checks.

</pre>

2007: A6 - Information Leakage and Improper Error Handling
----------------------------------------------------------

### EnterpriseSecurityException

Is the base class for all security related exceptions.
All EnterpriseSecurityExceptions have two messages, one for the user and one for the log file. This way, a message can be shown to the user that doesn’t contain sensitive information or unnecessary implementation details. Meanwhile, all the critical information can be included in the exception so that it gets logged.

<pre>
Constructor:
EnterpriseSecurityException(java.lang.String userMessage, java.lang.String logMessage)
 Creates a new instance of EnterpriseSecurityException.
</pre>

### HTTPUtilities

logHTTPRequest method format the Source IP address, URL, URL parameters, and all form parameters into a string suitable for the log file. The list of parameters to obfuscate should be specified in order to prevent sensitive information from being logged. If a null list is provided, then all parameters will be logged.
See A3
