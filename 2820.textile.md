microPZP Connection
===================

MicroPZPs will range in capability from the simplest devices attached over a wired serial connection through to comparatively powerful systems with a high-level OS such as Linux. These devices will support a range of connection options but will be constrained both by the physical ports and connection hardware, present but also by the available software libraries, drivers, CPU performance and available memory needed for higher-level protocols.

In order to accommodate the widest range of hardware capabilities and architectures, two possible connection architectures are defined for a microPZP. These are defined in the sections below.

TLS-capable microPZP
--------------------

This is a device that supports a TCP/IP stack, a TLS stack, and has the capability to store PZP enrolment credentials securely.

A TLS-capable microPZP may have means to connect directly to an IP network (eg via WiFi or a cellular data connection) or might connect through a local bus (Bluetooth PAN or USB RNDIS) to a networked gateway. However, in either case, TCP and TLS operate end-to-end from the microPZP to any webinos peer device, and any gateway operates at the IP level or below. No proxying of TLS or webinos protocols occurs at the gateway.

All JSON-RPC traffic operates over the TLS connection in the same way as for a full PZP. Service discovery and webinos API access are performed as for a full PZP.

With a TLS-capable micro PZP, enrolment credentials are stored securely on the microPZP. Management of those credentials is addressed in the microPZP Admin section.

Tethered microPZP
-----------------

A microPZP might not have the capability to communicate over TLS end-to-end; either because it does not support IP connections, is unable to run the TLS protocol or is unable to store enrolment credentials securely.

In this case it is possible for the microPZP to use another device â€“ typically a full PZP but not necessarily - as a proxy device. The TLS component of any connection between the microPZP and another peer is terminated at the proxy, with RPC traffic forwarded over a separate transport using the bus between the microPZP and proxy.

The bus between the microPZP and the proxying device must be a framed transport supporting error detection. The following transports, for example, are supportable:
* High-level Data Link Control (HDLC) over RS232 (or, for example, a virtualized COM port, over USB);
* Bluetooth RFCOMM accessed via Serial Port Profile (SPP).

The RPC proxy may simultaneously handle multiple TLS connections to remote peers and multiplexes the traffic to the microPZP over a single framed serial channel. The RPC proxy associates the reply_to field of each inbound RPC request with the TLS connection that it was received on, and forwards the corresponding replies or event notifications on that connection using the to field. The RMC message content is transparently forwarded in each direction.

In a typical proxy arrangement, the RPC proxy performs no transcoding of RPC messages, so JSON text is passed directly over the framed transport between the proxy and the microPZP. The JSON-RPC protocol thus operates end-to-end in the same way as for a full PZP. Service discovery and webinos API access are performed as for a full PZP.

However, for very constrained microPZPs it may be desirable to minimise the memory requirements of processing the RPC requests and responses; alternative binary encodings are permitted instead of JSON text including schemaless formats (eg BSON) and schema-based encodings (eg Thrift, Protocol Buffers). Schema-based encodings have the potential to be much more compact with minimal parsing overhead; the IDLs will in general include API-specific structs, which then require the proxy to be API-aware â€“ which defeats one of the advantages of the microPZP architecture. IDL for such representations are beyond the scope of this specification.

Enrolment of the micro PZP is more complex than for the TLS-capable devices. A tethered micro PZP is enrolled by installing the enrolment credentials on the proxy with other enrolment data being configured on the microPZP. Authentication of the micro PZP to the connected peer is then assured by the combination of the authenticated connection between the remote peer and the proxy, and a bus-specific device authentication method for the micro PZP. For example, for a micro PZP attached via Bluetooth RFCOMM, authentication is by the Bluetooth bonding process. A physical attachment (eg via serial cable) also provides device authentication under appropriate physical security measures. Management of enrolment credentials for a tethered micro PZP is addressed in the micro PZP Admin section.
