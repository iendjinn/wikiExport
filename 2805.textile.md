microPZP proxy
==============

A tethered microPZP requires a proxy device. The roles of the proxy are:
* initiate enrolment;
* store enrolment credentials locally for local termination of TLS;
* remotely configure microPZP with other enrolment data as required via admin API;
* implement PZP discovery API to advertise existence of enrolled microPZPs;
* optionally, implement REST admin API, proxying to JSON-RPC admin API;
* terminate TLS for inbound and outbound peer device connections, maintaining mapping between local socket and peer id;
* proxy JSON-RPC requests to microPZP bus, and forward responses to relevant TLS socket;
* optionally, perform transcoding of RPC requests and responses to compact microPZP representation;
* optionally, perform bus discovery to discover new microPZPs and initiate enrolment.

The PZP proxy does not need to be a full PZP but it is probably easiest to think of it as a PZP that supports the PZP discovery service at least.
Implementation-wise, the microPZP proxy may simply be implemented by subsetting the full PZP reference implementation.
