Cited from Christian Fuhrhop’s email sent on 1 Feb 2011, 11:15 CEST:

> From the requirements and the first basic architecture, we should have a reasonable idea what elements are needed to get a working webinos environment.

> So the first part, based on requirements, existing solutions, experience and common sense, would be to give a definition of the architecture element and a description of what information this element needs from other elements, what information it will provide to other elements and where it (conceptually) will run.

The initial proposal of how to do IDM in webinos is depicted in the attached slides. They are the basis for discussion for the Turin meeting.

Cited from Nick Allot’s email sent on 1 Mar 2011, 12:26 CEST

> From a architectural perspective â€“ the concrete things I expect as outputs are

-   Data formats â€“ syntaxes
-   Algorithms â€“ description of processes
-   Protocols â€“ over the air message flows (syntax and semantics)
-   APIs â€“ predominately on device, in process functions, and data formats (syntax and semantics)
-   Data schemas: databases and stores
-   Otherâ€¦.

> As always â€“ where we can reuse other technologies directly, or reuse with minor amendments â€“ this is ALWAYS preferred to inventing something new ïŠ

The discussions in the Turin meeting (23/24 Feb 2011) allowed to focus the work for this theme further. It is still all to be seen as proposals and drafts. Please contribute! A list of features which should be supported by User IDM in webinos follows further down.

State-of-the-art in User Identity Management
--------------------------------------------

**All**: please find additional relevant state-of-the-art which is not yet listed in the table below!

|#|Name|Short explanation|Main features|URL|Relevance for Webinos|Lead|
|01|OpenID|OpenID is a user centric, decentralized authentication protocol using web technologies allowing single sign on. An OpenID provider can do the authentication of a user for some service and the service does not have to store identity or credential information.| OpenID is a decentralized authentication protocol without a central authority and uses standard HTTP (S) requests and responses. Protocol extensions exist for example for attribute exchange. The identifier used is either a HTTP (S) URI or an XRI (Extensible Resource Identifier)|"OpenID main page":http://openid.net/|It is relevant for Webinos as OpenID is a web standard and is based on web technologies. It supports decentralized authentication and is extensible by other protocols building them on top. Similar to other protocols it relies on a constant data connection to a third party thus changes are necessary (if possible) for the P2P inter-device authentication scenario.|DOCOMO|
|02|Oauth|The description is referring to OAuth 2.0 which is in the final stages of specification with IETF and already implemented by Facebook. OAuth allows a resource owner to grant a client access to some resource without giving away its credentials for the resource. | OAuth uses web technology (HTTP (S)) to give fine grained access to resources. Resource owners don’t have to provide their credentials to the clients. The protocol flow is dependent on the client i.e. a client in the web browser or client on a secure server.|"OAuth main page":http://oauth.net/|It is relevant for Webinos but is only concerned with authorization to resources. A problem in some P2P ad-hoc scenarios might be that clients need to be pre-registered to get an access token to a resource. Also the authentication of resource owners is out of scope of the protocol.|DOCOMO|
|03|Friend of a Friend|||||postponed|
|04|Zero knowledge proofs|||||W3C???|
|05|federation identity||||||
|06|Liberty Aliance / Kantara|Liberty alliance is a consortium for developing a distributed identity management system. It includes an Identity Federation Framework (ID-FF), an Identity Web Service Framework (ID-WSF) and Identity Services Interface Specifications (ID-SIS). ID-FF enables identity federation and management and it is designed to work with heterogeneous platforms and with all types of network devices; ID-WSF provides a framework for creating, discovering, and consuming interoperable identity services; ID-SIS are a collection of specifications for interoperable services to be build on top of ID-WSF.
The work of the Liberty Alliance is transitioning to the Kantara Initiative.|The Alliance adopts and extends industry standards, rather than attempt to develop similar specifications.
ID-FF Liberty architecture needs an Identity Provider (IDP) and uses http protocol to exchange messages between IDP and Service Provider to authenticate the User Agent.
ID-WSF is a foundational layer that utilizes the ID-FF and provides services. The Discovery Service determines where the needed resources are located (e.g. user attributes). The Interaction Service allows an IDP to interact with the owner of the resource that it is exposing. The Data Services supports the storage and update of specific data attributes regarding a user.
ID-SIS provides specifications for interoperable services (e.g. Geo-location Service, Personal Profile Service Specification, Employee Profile Service Specification, Contact Book Service Specification).|"Liberty Alliance":http://www.projectliberty.org/
"Kantara Initiative":http://kantarainitiative.org/|ID-FF is relevant as an authentication framework. Not suitable for P2P scenario because the need of the IDP.
ID-WSF is relevant as a framework to provide services to support ID management.|Polito|
|07|Shibboleth|It’s an open source implementation of SAML 2.0 specifications. It provides an authentication and authorization infrastructure to allow federated web single sign on and attribute exchange. A user authenticates with his organizational credentials. The organization (or identity provider) passes the minimal identity information necessary to the service manager to enable an authorization decision.|SAML 2.0 is an XML-based open standard for exchanging authentication and authorization data between an identity provider and a service provider. Its specifications recommend SSL 3.0 or TLS 1.0 for transport-level security; XML Signature and XML Encryption for message-level security. SAML 2.0 permits direct use of XML Encryption in various places, including an <EncryptedID> element that can replace the usual <NameID> element.
SAML 2.0 allows for arbitrary mappings between any two formats by using the <NameIDPolicy> element to describe the properties of the identifier to be returned.|"Shibboleth":http://shibboleth.internet2.edu/
"SAML 2.0":http://www.oasis-open.org/specs/index.php#saml|Its SSO and attribute exchange functionalities are relevant for Webinos. Not suitable for P2P scenario because the need of the IDP.|Polito|
|08|Identity Metasystem / Infocard|||||postponed|
|09|Kerberos| Kerberos is a mutual client/server authentication system designed to establish sessions and support the secure transfer of data. Kerberos can be used as a single sign on mechanism|Kerberos requires a trusted third party and uses _tickets_ and _ticket granting tickets_ to allow it to scale to multiple services without repeated user authentication. Kerberos does not require the use of asymmetric cryptography and uses time stamps for validity periods.|"Kerberos at MIT":http://web.mit.edu/kerberos/| Kerberos is a distributed, scalable authentication system which might be attractive for managing capabilities on distributed devices. It also can be used for SSO, one of the requirements for Webinos. However, the reliance on a trusted third party might make it inappropriate when a data connection is lost and not suitable for a P2P inter-device authentication scenario. |Oxford|
|10|SIM Identity|||||DOCOMO|
|11|Stork|||||Polito|
|12|Direct Anonymous Attestation (DAA)|The Direct Anonymous Attestation (DAA) is a protocol which enables the remote authentication of a trusted platform while preserving the user’s privacy. DAA is adopted by the Trusted Computing Group (TCG) in the Trusted Platform Module (TPM) specification version 1.2.|The DAA protocol is based on three entities: the DAA issuer, who verifies the trusted platform and issues DAA credential to the platform; the DAA signer, in other words the host, equipped with the security chip, who uses the DAA credential; the DAA verifier, an external partner which can verify the credential without violating the platform’s privacy.
The DAA signer locally generates a secret key SK and send to the issuer a commitment on SK, and the security chip certificate. The issuer validates the received certificate and issues the DAA credential.
To sign a message, the signer computes the digital signature from SK and DAA credential. The verifier, using the issuer public key, can check the received signature without any information on the identity of the signer.|"DAA sides on TGC website":http://www.trustedcomputinggroup.org/resources/direct_anonymous_attestation|It would relevant for webinos to allow anonymous authentication.
The availability of the security chip can be circumvented using a software implementation.
A major drawback is the lack of support for authorized sharing of SK and credential among devices of the same personal cloud.|Polito|
|13|Group signatures/authentication|Group signature allows members of a group to sign messages on behalf of the group. Signatures can be verified with respect to a single group public key.|Each group member holds its own private key to sign messages. Signature do not reveal the identity of the signer. It is not possible to decide whether two signatures have been issued by the same group member. Exists a designated group manager who can revoke the anonymity and reveal the identity of the signer.
It is possible to dynamically join the group. Due to anonymity of signatures it is not possible to ban a group member in a simple way: after the standard signature verification, the verifier should contact the group manager to do a membership check. Alternatively a new group should be created and the previous group public key should be in some way blacklisted or inserted in a CRL.
AFAIK there is not yet a practical implementation of group signatures.|"Foundations of Group Signatures: Formal Definitions, Simplified Requirements, and a Construction Based on General Assumptions":http://cseweb.ucsd.edu/users/mihir/papers/gs.html
"Foundations of Group Signatures: The Case of Dynamic Groups":http://cseweb.ucsd.edu/users/mihir/papers/dgs.html|It could be an interesting mechanism to allow anonymous authentication in webinos, but this research topic is not yet in an implementation phase.|Polito|
|14|Identity mechanisms of XMPP|XMPP is an XML based protocol for near-real-time messaging, presence and request-response services using for confidential and integral message exchange TLS.|The XMPP identifier (e.g. node@domain/resource) has as mandatory field only the domain identifier and is used to address an endpoint. To authenticate an endpoint SASL is used enabling a server to offer multiple authentication methods from which a client can choose. |"XMPP Core Protocol":http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3920 and "SASL - Simple Authentication and Security Layer":http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2222|The interesting parts for Webinos are the addressing schema and the usage of the SASL protocol as this enables support for several authentication mechanisms.|DOCOMO|
|15|Identity mechanisms of SIP|||||DOCOMO|
|16|Idemix|Idemix is an anonymous credential system which anonymize the user towards the service provider and minimize the release of personal information.
It is a project of IBM Zurich Research Laboratory and the Identity Mixer cryptographic library is publicly available free-of-charge.
Idemix allows users to identify themselves using pseudonyms, and different pseudonyms of same user cannot be linked
The user can prove the possession of a credential without revealing the credential itself, and he can choose which credential attributes to reveal to the service provider.|To get a credential the user contact the issuer and establishes a pseudonym N.
If N is eligible, the issuer produces a credential C by signing a statement containing attributes and N, and sends C to U.
To get a service, the user shows this credential to the verifier using a zero-knowledge proof (the user does not send the credential nor the pseudonym N, this ensure the unlinkability).
Credentials can have attributes and the user can choose which attributes to prove something about and what to prove about them (e.g do not show the age but only prove that it is over 18).
To deter users from pool credentials Idemix use an all-or-nothing non-transferability mechanism. User credentials are linked to his master secret and sharing just one pseudonym or credential implies sharing all of the user’s other credentials and pseudonyms in the system.
Idemix offer an optional mechanism of anonymity revocation, which require the existence of an entity named de-anonymizer, and the user cooperation when showing a credential.
When the user ask for a service, he sends to the verifier his pseudonym N ecrypted with the de-anonymizer public key. The verifier has proof that the de-anonymizer can decrypt and reveal N.|"Idemix":http://www.zurich.ibm.com/~pbi/identityMixer_gettingStarted/
"Identity Mixer cryptographic library":http://prime.inf.tu-dresden.de/idemix/|Idemix can allow anonymous authentication in webinos, but to share credentials among personal cloud devices can be very dangerous: a guest, obtaining a credential of another user, can access the user master secret and pose as him in the system.|Polito|

Explanations on how to read the table:
* **Feature**: the feature which webinos will support
* **Existing solution**: the solution from the state-of-the-art on which the feature can be based on
* **Effort**: effort of implementing the feature by taking into account the existing solutions. I.e. there is almost no complexity if we can just reuse existing solutions but there is effort if we have to extend/modify existing solutions.
* **Lead**: the partner of the webinos consortium who has the lead in specifying this feature. HAving the lead means **being main contributor _and_ coordinating contribution of other partners**.

### (Technical) Problems in Detail

#### 01 - Identify the user to any webinos device and application

-   Privacy issues: should not respond to any request by any device
-   Identification for devices with multiple users on one device (e.g. set-top box) can be tricky

#### 02 - perform SSO of the user for any device and application belonging to the user

-   essential for webinos (see for instance the _Single Sign-On, Multiple Devices_ Story

#### 03 - perform SSO of the user to certain hosted services/applications

-   difference to #02 is that here third parties with already existing identification/authentication schemes are involved
-   we will address this later after the other SSO topic #02
-   privacy issues
-   support of other IDM protocols required — see #08

#### 04 - Identity Provider (IDP) which is known by and accessibly by any entity

-   issues partial IDs and pseudonyms; see also #06
-   Device discovery may use the IDP to find devices of a user
-   Dose not necessarily have to be known by all entities
-   Not necessarily required to be only one IDP
-   Closely related to user data management; could be combined

#### 05 - SSO is supported by IDP and without involvement of IDP for local networks

-   this is essential for webinos as there may be no online connection and SSO should also work without IDP

#### 06 - partial identities and pseudonyms are issued by the IDP

-   could be a first solution but should be made more flexible and robust later

#### 07 - Build on the defined data schema for â€œidentifying userâ€ to reflect that the user may have different identities

-   essential for webinos

#### 08 - interfacing with existing identities and IDM services is supported (e.g. Facebook)

-   essential for webinos, as users have existing identities elsewhere
-   outsource IDM to Facebook rather than interfacing? Could make sense as it reduces implementation effort for webinos

#### 09 - User authentication is based on the identities provided by our IDM

-   Essential for webinos
-   Should be based on user identifier
-   User authentication should depend on device capabilities (e.g. finger print, user name/password, …)
-   Tightly related to device authentication (e.g. Android); first user authenticates with one device, then the device authenticates towards other devices on behalf of the user

#### 10 - IDP supports conversion of credentials (due to heterogenity of existing services/protocols)

-   Covered by #08 (_interfacing â€¦_) above

#### 11 - IDP holds list of devices which belong to a user for addressing/discovery purposes

-   could be used for device discovery, see #04
-   Talk to discovery subtopic group
-   privacy issues

#### 12 - initiate a secure communication channel for identification and authentication

-   we have to address but reuse existing stuff

#### 13 - key managent with lightweight PKI

-   avoiding PKI is good but we should not discard it right from the beginning
-   some trusted components may need it (e.g. operators)
-   using symmetric crypto is also difficult — we should not ban PKI from the beginning
    -   light PKIs with short lifetime keys without CRL does exist
    -   a not fully fledged PKI is preferred

#### 14 - mobile phone/SIM card for user identification and authentication bootstrap

-   easier than with devices with multiple users on a device
-   good starting point
-   there may be users without a mobile phone
