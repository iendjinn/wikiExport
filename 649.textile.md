Policy Management Meeting 15th April 2011
=========================================

Attendees
---------

* Salvatore
 * Davide
 * Andrea
 * Dieter
 * John

Decisions
---------

-   The subject of XACML back-end policies will be the application unique identifier, which is synonymous with the application itself. Option ‘0’ from the options page.
-   P3P Policies to be referenced from application feature request statements in the config xml file
-   Policy protection may require attestation, so we need to make sure this gets into 3.2 APIs

Actions
-------

-   John to contact IDM and discuss:
    -   How identity should be expressed in policies - e.g. what level of authentication might be expressed, what identities will actually look like
    -   How applications will express identity requirements
    -   How identity should be negotiated for privacy
-   Salvatore to investigate XACML request structure
-   Salvatore to provide example XACML policies
-   John to investigate XACML delegation
-   John to investigate how remote script access control will be defined
-   Dieter to look into javascript APIs as part of context management to work out how policies will be handled in Javascript
-   Dieter to provide examples of wireframes for policy GUIs.
-   Andrea to… investigate attestation API?

Context considerations
----------------------

-   Hierarchy of context discussed: you may need access to some context data in order to gain access to other context data. How should this be expressed and managed?
-   Frequency of access: how do you define how often a piece of information will be accessed, and what do policies look like here?
    -   Suggestion by Davide that context management component should push updates to client applications.
    -   Comment by John: simplest alternative would be the best one, users unlikely to know upfront about how often they want their location checked, so either "constant" or "on command", possibly?

Security considerations
-----------------------

-   Protection of policies on the device
-   Avoid the device being cracked and betraying handset manufacturer or operator policies
-   Synchronise policy updates wherever possible - what about devices which are rarely used?

Next meeting
------------

Wednesday at 2pm BST / 3pm CEST.
Skype again unless someone else participates who can’t use it.
