Policy (draft)
==============

The role of the policy manager is to enforce privacy and access control requests, coming from local and remote requesters, in order to manage the disclosure of personal data and to control access to personal zone device capabilities and features.
The aforementioned process is done by matching requests to resources against written policies in order to determine an access control decision. This decision could be to allow or deny access to the requested resources, or involve further interaction and consent with the resource owner.

In the following sessions a brief background overview is provided and specifications will follow up. Aspects that will be taken into consideration are access control and privacy policies and the synchronization mechanisms. Furthermore the policy grammar and some examples will be presented.
