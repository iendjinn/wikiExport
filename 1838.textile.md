Aligning Webinos APIs with latest W3C and other standards
=========================================================

This page list potential actions on APIs related to W3C evolution on standards since task 3.2.

Video streams and video element
-------------------------------

As part of the new media capture API (getUserMedia) and the work on WebRTC, there are "discussions":http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-media-capture/2012Mar/0048.html on how to assign the content of a video stream to a video element; we should align with the outcome of these discussions in the TV API.

Web Intents for service discovery
---------------------------------

Google and Mozilla has been promoting Web Intents for quite some time and a W3C Web Intents task force is running. Google is editing a "draft Web Intents specification":http://dvcs.w3.org/hg/web-intents/raw-file/tip/spec/Overview.html. As part of task 8.1 webinos is impacting the standard to support local and dynamic service discovery, for example in a home network. For more information see "WP8.1 Web Intents page":http://dev.webinos.org/redmine/projects/wp8-1/wiki/Web_Intents.

We should consider if Webinos should switch to a Web Intents based service discovery mechanism.

W3C Gallery API.
----------------

Webinos refers to the "W3C Gallery API":http://dev.w3.org/2009/dap/gallery/ but this API has been "shelved":http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-device-apis/2012Feb/0004.html.

We should consider if we should replace the Gallery API or propose improvements to the API so it can be lifted to an active specification again. One idea that was mentioned for that API was to use a Web Intents approach. See proposal from Samsung on a "Web Intents based Gallery API":https://dvcs.w3.org/hg/dap/raw-file/16185b62381d/gallery/index.html.

NFC API
-------

W3C is launching an NFC Working Group. See "Near Field Communications (NFC) Working Group Charter":http://www.w3.org/2012/05/nfc-wg-charter.html. We should plan on switching to the W3C API, by late 2012 or early 2013. More details on the "W3C NFC Wiki":http://www.w3.org/wiki/Near_field_communications_(NFC)

Event handling APIs
-------------------

Align webinos event based APIs with event handling according to "W3C Battery Status API":http://dvcs.w3.org/hg/dap/raw-file/tip/battery/Overview.html?

Align with W3C Sensor APIs
--------------------------

Intel and Telefonica have been editing a "Sensor API":http://dvcs.w3.org/hg/dap/raw-file/tip/sensor-api/Overview.html that is similar to Webinos Sensor API. However, there has been a shift to separate specifications for each of the sensors, with simple DOM events. The DAP WG is likely to combine these with Web Intents for access to off device sensors, and for selection between multiple sensors on the same device.

Currently W3C DAP has specified the following sensor, actuator and device status APIs:

-   "Vibration API":http://www.w3.org/TR/2012/CR-vibration-20120508/
-   "Proximity events":http://dvcs.w3.org/hg/dap/raw-file/tip/proximity/Overview.html
-   "Network Information API":http://dvcs.w3.org/hg/dap/raw-file/tip/network-api/Overview.html
-   "Battery Status API":http://dvcs.w3.org/hg/dap/raw-file/tip/battery/Overview.html

REST APIs
---------

Consider switching to REST APIs for some webinos APIs (Vehicle, TV, Sensorsâ€¦)

W3C DAP APIs does not cover installed web applications
------------------------------------------------------

See "Installing web apps - Browser vs System level security":http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-device-apis/2012Feb/0046.html

W3C System Level APIs WG
------------------------

W3C launches a new working group on system level APIs, see "Draft charter for W3C System Applications WG":http://www.w3.org/2012/05/sysapps-wg-charter.html. In addition, new work on application packaging is chartered to take place in the Web Apps WG. We should consider tracking/influencing their work using our WP 8.1 budget.
