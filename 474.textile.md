* Find important state-of-the-art which we are still missing until Mar 7, COB (all)

We did:
* Discuss relevant state-of-the-art technologies and assigned a responsible partner to each of them for further investigation. The partner should (right on the wiki page in the table)
**** Briefly summarise the technology
**** List its benefits
**** Add the URL
**** Draft the relevance for webinos
* Identify the need for all to see if there is yet unreferenced relevant state-of-the-art
* Discuss the current list of problem areas/features on the wiki which are to be addressed in our identity management work (I added the comments to the table on the wiki.)
**** In order to get a common understanding
**** In order to identify those which are too narrow/wide, irrelevant or missing
**** We decided that the list is fine for now. Further elaborations upon the architecture will result in prioritisation of these problem areas/features
* Agree that there should be a initial draft of the architecture soon
**** To foster our common understanding of the bits and peaces
**** To have a besis for a discussion of the related subtobics overlay network, device discovery and privacy & security
**** Polito volunteered to draft this initial architecture

Next meeting:
* In one week, Tue Mar 8, 14h-15h CET
