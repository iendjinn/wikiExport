Policy architecture and enforcement point
=========================================

Introduction and gap analysis
-----------------------------

The role of the policy manager is to enforce privacy and access control requests - coming from local/remote requestors - to manage the disclosure of user’s personal data and to control the access to the local device capabilities and features. This is done matching the requests against written policies in order to determine a decision which could be to allow or deny the access to the requested resources.
The task 3.1 specified mainly the access control architecture and how to integrate it with a privacy management architecture which was not completely defined.

The specification proposed in the task 3.1 was not fully implemented during task 4.1. In particular
In the current implementation the policies are written in an xml file (following the format specified "here":http://dev.webinos.org/redmine/projects/wp3-1/wiki/Spec_-_Security#Policy-Format in task 3.1). In this file it’s possible to specify multiple sets of policies: every set has a "combine" rule that is used to determine which policy shall be applied, eg. with the "first-matching-target" combine rule, every request shall be matched against the first policy which matches the request’s target. At the actual stage of implementation, the target of a policy could be users, apps, devices or mix of them.
The policy manager can recognize every feature specified for APIs in the task 3.2 ("APIs specs":http://dev.webinos.org/specifications/draft/index.html) and also the ones specified "here":http://dev.webinos.org/redmine/projects/wp3-1/wiki/Spec_-_Security#Action-features in the task 3.1.
The policy manager defines also through it’s Node.js wrapper, a method to enforce requests: an example of usage can be found "here":http://dev.webinos.org/redmine/projects/wp4/wiki/W3C_contacts_module .
At the moment only the Contacts Module, Device Status API, the Context Manager and some demos have integrated the policy enforcement.

### Main differences: 3.1 specs vs 4.1 implementation

These are the main differences between the current implementation and what has been specified:

-   there are not PIP and Context Handler, since it was expected a deeper integration between policy and context manager. Management of obligations is not implemented as well.

-   The Policy manager action is voluntary, in the sense that calls to policy manager functions must be explicitly inserted. This seems slightly contrasting with the PEP put in the XACML engine (in T3.1 specification), that suggest a mandatory control for all APIs (BTW, this would be in line with the Context manager behavior, which listen every RPCs)

-   The privacy part (DHDF, P3P etc) has been investigated but not implemented.

-   Different prompt types are not fully implemented (the Policy manager is ready to be extended with "session" and blanket" prompt types, but at the moment only _one-shot_ is fully available).
-   actual implementation lacks of a mechanism to synchronize policies and taken decisions (PDP Cache) among devices
-   IDs in policies are not stored in "Trusted records" and the generic values for targets cannot be used

Focus
-----

In this task the focus should be on the privacy management system (proposed architecture review + privacy policies language) and on a more detailed mechanism to share policies and related resources among users’ devices.
Another point to work on are the privileged applications: for example in this task the functionalities for a graphic policy editor could be defined.

Privacy architecture
--------------------

### PrimeLife findings

Here follows a brief description of PrimeLife attempt to define an architecture and language for privacy policy specification. This will likely be of inspiration for the webinos definition of policy privacy architecture. Majority of information provided here comes from PrimeLife deliverable D5.3.4 (http://www.primelife.eu/images/stories/deliverables/d5.3.4-report_on_design_and_implementation-public.pdf). The analysis is particularly focused on the PrimeLife Privacy Policy Language (PPL) designed for handling access control and privacy.

#### Subjects

PrimeLife defines different privacy editors, actors who can define their specific privacy rules, that can be conflicting.
* Data controller, who is the entity which alone or jointly with others determines the purposes
and means of the processing of personal data
* Data subject, who is the person whose personal data are collected, held or processed by the Data Controller.

The language would be used by
* the Data Controller to specify the access restrictions to the resources that he offers;
* the Data Subject to specify access restrictions to her personal information, and how she wants her information to be treated by the Data Controller afterwards;
* the Data Controller to specify how "implicitly" collected personal information (e.g. IP addesses) will be treated;
* the Data Subject to specify how it wants this implicit information to be treated.

#### Language main components

-   target :it describes the resource, the subject, and the environment variables for which this rule is applicable.
    It is described by a _<xacml:Target>_ element containing a number of nested _<xacml:AnyOf>_ and _<xacml:AllOf>_ elements.

-   credential requirements (introduced by PPL): it describes the credentials that need to be presented in order to be granted access to the resource;

-   provisional actions (introduced by PPL): it describes which actions (e.g., revealing attributes or signing statements) have to be performed by the requestor in order to be granted access;

-   condition (improved respect XACML standard): specifying further restrictions on the applicability of the rule beyond those specified in the target and the credential requirements.
    The _<xacml:Condition>_ contains an element of type _<xacml:Expression>_ that evaluates to a Boolean.
    <CredentialAttributeDesignator> is a new element of type _<xacml:Expression>_ that can be used inside a _<xacml:Condition>_ to retrieve an attribute value from a presented credential.

-   data handling policies (introduced by PPL): describing how the information that needs to be revealed to satisfy this rule will be treated afterwards.

-   data handling preferences (introduced by PPL): describing how the information contained in the resource that is protected by this rule has to be treated.

#### New elements

-   authorization element: augmented with _<AuthzUseForPurpose>._, which enumerates a list of purposes authorized to use the information, and
    _<AuthzDownstreamUsage>_, which gives the permission to forward the information protected by this policy to a third party. This authorization enables the data subject to specify the policy under which the information will be made available.

-   credential requirements: Each rule can contain a _<CredentialRequirements>_ element to specify the credentials. The _<CredentialRequirements>_ element contains a separate _<Credential>_ element for each credential that needs to be presented, plus a _<Condition>_ element describing the conditions that the attributes of these credentials have to satisfy.
    The _<Credential>_ element can contain restrictions that apply to the credential. These restrictions can be expressed two ways: by means of a list of _<AttributeMatchAnyOf>_ elements within the _<Credential>_ element, or by means of the generic _<xacml:Condition>_ element that is a sibling of the list of _<Credential>_ elements, and that contains all other conditions related to the credential attributes.

-   data handling policies: _<DataHandlingPolicy>_ element expresses what will happen to the information about the Data Subject collected during an access request. A data handling policy consists of a set of authorizations, contained in an _<AuthorizationsSet>_ element (composed of _<AuthzUseForPurpose>_ and _<AuthzDownstreamUsage>_ elements), that the Data Controller wants to obtain on the collected information, and a set of obligations, expressed in a _<ObligationsSet>_ element, that he promises to adhere to.
    Obligations are specified inside _<Obligation>_ elements, which on their turn contain a _<TriggersSet>_ element describing the events that trigger the obligation, an _<Action>_ element describing the action to be performed, and a _<Validity>_ element describing the validity time frame of the obligation.

-   data handling preferences: The data handling preferences of a rule, embedded in the _<DataHandlingPreferences>_ element, specify how the information obtained from the resource protected by this rule is to be treated after access is granted. The preferences are expressed by means of a set of authorizations and obligations, just like data handling policies. Data handling preferences always describe how the resource protected by the rule itself has to be treated, while data handling policies pertain to information that a requester will have to reveal in order to be granted access to the resource.

-   sticky policies: The sticky policy associated to a resource, meaning the agreed-upon sets of granted authorizations and promised obligations with respect to a resource, is expressed in the <StickyPolicy> element. The sticky policy is usually the result of an automated matching procedure between the data subject’s data handling preferences and the data controller’s data handling policy.

-   provisional actions: This element describes a set of provisional actions that needs to be fulfilled in order to satisfy an access control rule for certain server-side resource. The schema of the _<ProvisionalAction>_ element is consciously kept independent of the particular provisional action that needs to be fulfilled, in order to allow the possibility for the future extensions with the new provisional action types.
    In the current version of PPL specification the list of possible provisional actions includes revealing of users’ (requestor) attributes, signing a statement, "spending" the credential which is understood as a mean of restricting number of times that the same credential can be used.

Note: PPL doesn’t use the standard _<xacml:Obligations>_ element to specify the obligations because it can only be used to specify obligations that the local PEP enforces to the resource being protected. It cannot be used for data handling preferences either, since the latter specify obligations that the recipient of the resource has to adhere to, rather than the PEP that is protecting access to the resource.

#### Matching mechanisms

For the basic XACML part, the tool used is the java-based Heras-af (http://www.herasaf.org/). For the Primelife privacy extension part, PrimeLife defines an Obligations Matching Engine (OME). A new component of this kind is required in PrimeLife because particular emphasis is give, to protect the privacy, to the obligations, which defines how information must be treated when not under the data subject control (e.g. how much time can be kept and stored, if they must be anonymized, if they can be forwarded to third parties, …).
Usually OME performs the matching at the data subject side, but this operation can be performed also at the data controller side: If the information is considered for forwarding to a third party (named "downstream data controller"), the data controller performs a matching between its policy and the downstream data controller.
The evaluation is performed comparing the user preferences versus the data controller policies, for each obligation. The result is "true" if the policy is more restrictive than the preference, "false" otherwise. An obligation is mroe restrictive if is more restrictive both on the action and on the trigger part. More restrictive on the trigger meansthat for each preference trigger there exists a more restrictive trigger in the policy counterpart (in the policy part can be present more triggers than in the preferences). Action and trigger matching is not fully defined, open to future extension and what "more restrictive" means could slightly differ between different OME’s implementation
