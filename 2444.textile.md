Sources of Threat Data
----------------------

We have used the following sources of data to identify threats, vulnerabilities and attacks that may relate to webinos:

### CAPEC

The Common Attack Pattern Enumeration and Classification (CAPEC) is a database of methods for attacking systems based on the style of _Design Patterns_. Attack Patterns try to be sufficiently abstract that they can be translated between different systems. For webinos, the CAPEC database has been imported into the CAIRIS tool and used as a source of _threats_. The webinos attack patterns are defined with the additional details of the webinos architecture but are often inspired and closesly related to CAPEC attack patterns. ([[D036_References#CAPEC|CAPEC]])

### CWE

The Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) provides a "unified, measurable set of software weaknesses". The CWE database of vulnerabilities was added to the CAIRIS tool and aligned with attack patterns. ([[D036_References#CWE|CWE]])

### OWASP

The Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP) provides a wealth of data on attacks and threats to web applications. Dozens of threats and attacks have been added to the CAIRIS tool based on the OWASP project and then aligned with attack patterns. ([[D036_References#OWASP|OWASP]])
