API Analysis - Template
=======================

Follow this template for each API and then add the analysis here: [[D036 API Security Issues|API Security Analysis]]

API Analysis - Example API
==========================

Overview of API
---------------

Link to API - http://dev.webinos.org/specifications/new/example.html

This is a brief description of the API

Threats
-------

### API-Specific threats and misuse cases

1.  These are the obvious threats that misuse of this API could cause for users
2.  I have elicited these by considering the assets that the API gives access to, as well as what happens if the API is excessively used.
3.  I have taken into consideration several personas
4.  I have looked at the Mozilla approach for this/a similar API - https://wiki.mozilla.org/WebAPI#APIs
5.  I have taken into consideration any "security and privacy considerations" section of related specifications

### Threats based on remote invocation of this API from another device

1.  When this API is called from another device, what are the additional security concerns?
2.  When this API is called from another user on another device, what are the additional security concerns?

### Implementation threats and possible attacks

1.  Based on my experience in implementation in phase 1, the following attacks might be possible…

### Threats to apps and developers using this API (E.g. Jimmy and Jessica)

1.  How might a developer be caused harm by relying on this API?
2.  How might an app be damaged or attacked through this API?

### Threats to device manufacturers, operators, other stakeholders

1.  How might other stakeholders be affected - could it cause excessive traffic, for example?

Mitigations
-----------

1.  How should the API be designed, implemented or constrained such that the threats are mitigated?
2.  Should the API be turned off by default?
3.  Should the API require authorisation always?
4.  Should the API result in some kind of notification or logging event?

Recommended default policy rules for applications
-------------------------------------------------

The following ‘types’ of application are supported in webinos: [[Types of Application]]. This table provides a summary:

  ------------- --------------------------------------------------- -- ----- ------------------------------------------------------
  _.Code   _.Type
  B-A           Browser-based, authenticated via TLS certificates
  W-U           Widget, unrecognised
  ------------- --------------------------------------------------- -- ----- ------------------------------------------------------

For each application type, select one of these as the default policy for this API. This applies to an application which explicitly requests access to this API.

  _.B-A   _.W-R   _.W-U   _.Policy                       _.Explanation (Browser apps)                                                                                                                        _.Explanation (Widgets)                                                                                                          Silently allow                        2. Applications will be granted access to this API without user consent being required. This can only be modified using a policy editor.
                                         Default allow (install time)        Widgets will need user consent at install time, but users will expect to allow it (the tick-box will automatically be filled in).                        Webpages will prompt for consent (Yes / No / Always) at runtime
                                         Default ask at runtime (one-shot)   Widgets will require one-off user consent at runtime. This fact will be visible & modifiable at install time.                                            Webpages will prompt for consent (Yes / No / Always) at runtime                                                                       Default ask at runtime (every time)   Widgets will require user consent at runtime, every time. This fact will be visible & modifiable at install time.
                                         Default deny (install time)         Widgets will require user consent at install time, but users will expect NOT to allow it (the tick-box will automatically be empty).                     Webpages will display a short notification at first-use saying that access was denied, with a button to change settings
                                         Silently deny                       2. Applications will not be granted access to this API, and users will not be asked at install time. This can only be modified using a policy editor.
