Background - Discovery
======================

Introduction
------------

Discovery is a procedure for retrieving addressing information of a device or service either through local or remote networking access mechanism.

The discovery mechanism varies on different discovery protocol adopted. Some technologies are not involved in discovery mechanism directly rather it gathers discovery information from existing discovery protocol, e.g. Serverless XMPP uses ZeroConf as its underlying discovery protocol and XMPP Core uses DNS resolve to gather server information.

The webinos discovery framework aims to define a set of interfaces that hide the complexity of internetworking technologies for both third party developers and web developers.

Scope
-----

### What’s in scope

Webinos discovery mechanism investigate the following issues:
* Local Discovery that are based on a variety of local discovery protocols, e.g. UPnP, ZeroConf, BT, WiFi, and USB.
* Remote Discovery that enables remote access to devices or services. Technologies investigated include XMPP and its extensions, Web Introducer and Web Finger. Distributed Hash Table (DHT) has been investigated, but deeper analysis is postponed to Phase II (see below)

### What’s out of scope

DHT is an optional P2P discovery technology for webinos. It provides a better flexibility to discover. However, in comparison, XMPP is capable of providing functions for storing information about friends, authenticating system, finding services. It also defines Protocol format required for webinos architecture communication. In Phase I, we focus on XMPP technology. Further investigations on DHT is not in scope of this phase of work.

Focus will be on Bluetooth and USB devices for local discovery in Phase I, this will give an understanding on local discovery aspect. Firewire and Zigbee will be considered in Phase II, , since they are not widespread local communication technology, in respect to the target core of webinos, their analysis is deferred.

Review of State of the Art
--------------------------

### Local Discovery

#### Zeroconf

Zeroconf is set of technologies to address following issues:
* Address configuration (assigned address using DHCP or host-configured link local address)
* Resolving host name to IP Address using Multicast DNS
* Description of services supported on device and way to communicate with the device, using DNS-SD Service Discovery

The multicast DNS/DNS-SD in Zeroconf makes use of following commands to browse, find address and named instances.
* Register (Services)
* Browse (Named instances)
* Resolve (Address and ports)

It fetches following information at end of DNS service discovery:
* Pointer record - PTR : mapping address to name which is of form <servicename>.<transport_protocol>.domain>(e.g. operator._http._udp.local, where operator is a unique user-visible name, no other node can have same name, _http._udp is protocol, and local is the domain)
* Service locator - SRV record (hostname + port) (e.g. operator.local port 6313). Specifies service location for fetching information about the protocol. This is also used in XMPP/SIP messages.
* Text Record - TXT (e.g. pdf:application/postscript).

Host offering publishes instances, service type, protocol information, domain name and config parameters.

See "implementation section":http://dev.webinos.org/redmine/wiki/wp3-1/Spec_-_Discovery#Implementation-Architecture for more details on ZeroConf examples and message format.

Depending on the messages, they are sent as unicast or multicast query. New services announce about its presence. It resolve address before sending packet, if it fails to find devices, it updates other devices too about the service unavailability.

In wide area network if domain is specified such as dns-sd.org, it will fetch the services available in this domain. This could solve the problem of service discovery outside local domain but imposes a domain registration for each user, that in general is not practical.

h4. UPnP

UPnP is a ISO standard for home network that supports automatic configuration, i.e. network should be self configurable. It is a protocol based approach and, differently from older PnP technologies, no device drivers are involved. UPnP specification is based on following protocols : HTTP, TCP/UDP, SOAP, and SSDP.

Communication is between controllers/control points and controlled services. One or more services are combined to form a device. Controlled devices handles requests from control point.

UPnP allows device to advertise its services to control points and allows control point to search for devices. Results of discovery are device type, device unique identifier, and URL for obtaining device description. Search and advertise are multicast messages, while request/response between control point and device are unicast messages. If IP address or services are changed it is responsibility of device to advertise the changed IP address. Each device, embedded device and service offered by each device should be advertised via multicast. Because of the nature of the UDP, advertisement message are sent multiple times and are based on the value specified in Cache Control. Cache controls the expiry time of advertisement.

In UPnP, discovery is done using SSDP (Simpler Service Discovery Protocol), it is based on HTTP protocol 1.1. It is a simple protocol which comprises of start line and list of message headers.

SSDP Start line:
* NOTIFY * HTTP/1.1 rn
* M-SEARCH * HTTP/1.1 rn
* HTTP/1.1 200 OK rn


h4. Discovery in Bluetooth

The process for Bluetooth service discovery involves two steps- inquiry all nearby devices, and connect to each of those devices in order to search for the requested services.

HCI inquiry can be used to detect nearby devices. It provides a command interface to the baseband controller and link manager, and access to hardware status and control registers. Essentially this interface provides a uniform method of accessing the Bluetooth baseband capabilities.The HCI exists across 3 sections, the Host - Transport Layer - Host Controller. Each of the sections has a different role to play in the HCI system.

In order to search services, bluetooth stack has provides Service Discovery Protocol (SDP). SDP enables network devices, applications, and services to seek out and find other complementary network devices, applications, and services needed to properly complete specified tasks. The attributes of a service include the type or class of service offered and the mechanism or protocol information needed to utilize the service.

SDP involves communication between a SDP server and a SDP client. The server maintains a list of service records that describe the characteristics of services associated with the server. Each service record contains information about a single service. A client may retrieve information from a service record maintained by the SDP server by issuing a SDP request. If the client, or an application associated with the client, decides to use a service, it must open a separate connection to the service provider in order to utilize the service. SDP provides a mechanism for discovering services and their attributes, but it does not provide a mechanism for utilizing those services.

Normally, a SDP client searches for services based on some desired characteristics of the services. However, there are times when it is desirable to discover which types of services are described by an SDP server’s service records without any a priori information about the services. This process of looking for any offered services is called browsing.

### Remote Discovery

#### XMPP (Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol)

XMPP architecture and messaging protocol is quite simple and is primarily a client-server technology. The established connection between client and server allows searching for friends, resources, items and services. **Resources** could be user devices, **items** are the devices which are not IP capable (e.g USB). More description about resources, items and services is included in the protocol definition section.

XMPP core is defined in RFC 6120, it describes about connection between XMPP client and server over public IP. It involves stream message exchange, feature and mechanism negotiation, security (TLS and SASL), presence, and message exchange. Discovery mechanism will rely on XMPP extension, XEP-0030 to search services, XEP-0174 for Serverless messaging (Discovery is based on ZeroConf, once device are resolved they can use XMPP). At different layers of Webinos system different XMPP extensions can be used and if particular exchange of message is required to support it is easy to implement extension using XMPP. More details about nodes and items is covered in "protocol definition section":http://dev.webinos.org/redmine/wiki/wp3-1/Spec_-_Discovery#Formal-Specification.

XMPP in case of public IP uses DNS SRV record to fetch information about the domain. At transport layer it uses TLS (Transport Layer Security) and allow usage of different SASL authentication mechanism to authenticate user. Different XMPP server imposes different mechanisms and different compression technologies to communicate between client and server.

#### Distributed Hash Tables (DHT)

DHT allows sharing of information between peers. User wishing to exchange information hash files and filename. The filename becomes key and is searchable by entities connected to same bootstrap and to same port. One entity acts as server that holds information about keys and responds back to clients about the node holding key. All nodes connected exchange information about nodes available i.e. which nodes are online and are checked for their presence from time to time.

There are different DHT Protocols such as Chord, Tapestry, Kademlia, they differ in how nodes are found. DHT is relevant to webinos and could be used for remote discovery. The main issue is to find relevant key we should use a layer on top to do searching of all remote nodes with appropriate search query. For example, searching for George specific device, information is stored in form of key. Information can be only obtained if user searching gives correct names based on which key was generated. If key is generated in form of George+Bluetooth, searching for George+bluetooth will not get result. A layer on top is required to handle this permutations to search for proper key.

If no adjacent clients are there how it communicates with remote nodes is not clear. Other issue is restrictive usage to allow only certain devices that matches user device should be accessible. For example: if devices are available in DHT based network stopping George device to be discoverable by Alice device is a problem. George device to be searchable by only George’s device, is not clear and how to do it needs to be defined in order to use DHT in secure way.

Major problem in DHT are change in node information becomes difficult to address a node, node acting as bootstrap needs to be available all the time, and controlling namespace for the key generated. In webinos context, DHT could be used to find peers which provides information of services available and will be further investigated in Phase II.

#### Web Finger

The WebFinger is protocol inspired by the old Name Finger protocol defined in "[RFC 742]":http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc742. The Name Finger protocol enables the possibility to get information about a given user. WebFinger is an evolution that instead of using a direct TCP connection, it uses HTTP "[RFC2616]":http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2616, "XRD":http://docs.oasis-open.org/xri/xrd/v1.0/os/xrd-1.0-os.html and Web Host Metadata "[IETF, draft-hammer-hostmeta-16]":http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-hammer-hostmeta-16 to provide a descriptor of a single user. The protocol consists of two parts:

-   One URI schemes to identify user accounts, e.g. acct:joe@example.com
-   A simple protocol for resolving a user account into an extensible descriptor formated as a XRD resource.

The protocol is not an official standard but the work has been driven by several parties involved "Identity Commons":http://www.idcommons.net/, that is a community of groups working on developing the identity and social layer of the web.

#### Web Introducer

It addresses finding services that user has registered on web. For example, it allows user to connect with his choice of photo sharing website, all the information is present with registrar and it provides information for communication of services.

It is quite relevant for webinos to allow addressability of different resources that are available over the web for a particular user and could be part of personal hub.

Recommendations from state of the art
-------------------------------------

### Local Discovery

The diversity of internetworking technologies for local discovery introduces a variety of discovery protocols and implementations. Our literature review and hand-on demo work recommend the use of SSDP defined in UPnP and ZeroConf for local IP network discovery due to their efficiency and popularity. For other devices that don’t support UPnP and ZeroConf, specific discovery mechanisms shall apply, e.g. standard Bluetooth HCI inquiry and SDP for Bluetooth device discovery.

### Remote Discovery

XMPP is a relevant technology as it supports finding friends, their resources, items and services. It supports publish and subscribe mechanism, event mechanism, and also serverless messaging for local area network.

Webinos platform could utilize XMPP core and its extensions. XMPP core specification allow device connectivity and establishing secure communication. XMPP is mostly considered as chatting protocol but for Webinos platform, XMPP specification/extension considered are service discovery, getting node information, and resource information.

Use webfinger to discovery Personal Zone Hubs (PZH). The PZH will be identified by a URI and this will introduce another personal address. However by using webfinger it will be possible to leverage on existing identities like an e-mail address, Facebook identity or Google Id which can be obtained from many different sources like the local contact book, social graph or from business cards. The end user does not need to be aware of the PZH URI.
