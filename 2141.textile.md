Notes:

1.  Synchronization appears not yet developed, consequently, related requirements (_Application data synchronisation, Application data synchronisation management, Application shutdown synchronisation, Application startup synchronisation, Data subset application synchronisation, Disable application data synchronisation, Disable device synchronisation, Synchronisation method, Time period based application synchronisation_) as well as the ones related to transparent transfer (_Session re-establishment, State and configuration transfer_) seem not related to any API.
2.  Also for Application state requirements (_Application running state, Application state availability, Personal device application status registration_) no specific API seems related. However, in this case there are two question marks:
    One about the _AppLauncher API_, which has a method to check if the application has been installed (that is however a different case in respect to the state mentioned in requirements).
    The other one is about context manager. In principle Context manager should be related to user context. However, the Context implementation is quite flexible, since _subscribeContextEvent_ and _executeQuery_ methods allow for a quite generic acquisition of information, possibly even related to application state.
3.  Regarding _personal device power status_, could be used the aspect _Battery_ with property _batteryLevel_ and _batteryBeingCharged_ (http://dev.webinos.org/specifications/new/vocabulary.html), using _getPropertyValue()_
4.  Regarding _persona device status registration_, in practice there is not an API to register explicitly the status, but using the above method information regarding the status, if stored by some means (e.g. system logging, context manager automatic data acquisition), could be accessed.
