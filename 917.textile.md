Analysis - JavaScript, BONDI and Android
========================================

Java Script Access Control:
===========================

-   JavaScript API Access Control layer: Controls access to all JavaScript APIs exposed by the Web Runtime. Each Feature is identified uniquely by URI, and this security layer mediates access to Features on the basis of that ID.
-   Device Capability Access Control layer: Controls access to the underlying capabilities of the device when used from JavaScript APIs. These Device Capabilities themselves are identified so that it is possible to write security policies that control access to specific capabilities independently of the JavaScript APIs used to access them.

The Javascript Privileges API line of code asking permission to enable a privilege which allows a script to access a target.

**For example**:

netscape.security.PrivilegeManager.enablePrivilege("UniversalPreferencesRead")
or
netscape.security.PrivilegeManager.enablePrivilege("UniversalPreferencesWrite")

**Privileges in Browser**:
Privilege in Browser represents permissions to access a specific target.
â€¢ UniversalBrowserRead - Reading of sensitive browser data. This allows the script to pass the same origin check when reading from any document.
â€¢ UniversalBrowserWrite - Modification of sensitive browser data. This allows the script to pass the same origin check when writing to any document.
â€¢ UniversalXPConnect - Unrestricted access to browser APIs using XPConnect
â€¢ UniversalPreferencesRead - Read preferences using the navigator.preference method.
â€¢ UniversalPreferencesWrite - Set preferences using thenavigator.preference method.
â€¢ UniversalFileRead - Access to file:// URLs.

BONDI Access Control:
=====================

-   The BONDI model is defined using concepts, terminology and semantics from the eXtensible Access Control Markup Language (XACML) framework.
-   BONDI policies are capable of representation in a compact XML format (and other formats, including a compact binary representation if necessary).
-   It is intended that BONDI policies are also eventually capable of representation in XACML, using a specific dictionary of attributes and a subset of XACML elements; however this is not currently possible without defining a number of extensions to XACML. It is hoped that this becomes possible with future revisions of the XACML standard.

**Logical Model**:

-   The BONDI access control system, from a logical perspective, mediates any attempt by an executing Web Application to access Device Capabilities using JavaScript APIs.
-   The access control system, implementing a specific access control policy, has the sole effect of making and enforcing an access control decision in relation to each attempted access.
-   In order to make that decision the access control system may request interactive confirmation from the user, but this is invisible to the requesting Web Application.

**Policy Structure**:

-   The policy in effect in any given context is logically expressed as a collection of specific access control rules. The rules are organised into groups, termed policies, and these in turn are
     organised into groups termed policy sets.
-   It helps to organise the rules into groups that can be independently created and maintained, sometimes under different authority
-   It provides a way of ensuring that the correct precedence is applied when processing rules.

**Security Policy**:

-   A collection of access control constraints, abstractly representable as a policy-set, as defined in the security policy model in this specification, that describes the circumstances under
     which Web Applications are permitted to access Features and underlying Device Capabilities.
-   A security policy configuration must be created and maintained this could be the source of usability problems and security vulnerabilities BONDI establishes a minimum common baseline for security policy management capability to ensure that web runtimes are manageable, the associated configuration data are interoperable between consuming devices.

**Security Framework**:

Proposes a general security framework that unifies the modeling, representation and enforcement of security policies. It allows the expression of different forms of security policy based on widget resource signatures and blacklists and/or whitelists of widgets, authors and websites. A compact XML-based interchange format is defined.

A model for the structure and meaning of security policies is defined. The model identifies:
* identity types
* resources
* attributes
* conditions

**Widget Signing requirement**:

widgets must be signed according to the W3C Widgets 1.0 digital signature specification the signature allows the web runtime to verify the integrity and authenticity of every file widgets must have a valid author signature and one or more valid distributor signature the web runtime must support processing of certificates that conform to the Wireless Application Protocol WAP Certificate and CRL Profiles Specification.

**Feature access**:

The dependencies of BONDI web applications are indicated in terms of one or more features a feature corresponds to specific functionality provided by a web runtime. The web runtime shall only enable a web application to use a JavaScript API if a dependency has been explicitly expressed access to the feature has been granted.

The web runtime must resolve all dependencies of features referenced statically at install time at instantiation time for widget resources that are instantiated without prior installation for each referenced feature, the web runtime shall evaluate an access control query.

The web runtime shall only grant access to features that are advertised as being dependencies of the web application this requires that the access control system is able to control access based on the ID of a feature it must be possible to represent security policies portably all identifiers used in a security policy shall be portably defined (feature and device capabilities).

**Access Control Policy Structure**:

The policy is expressed as a collection of specific access control rules. The rules are organized into groups, termed policies and these in turn are organized into groups termed policy sets each rule is specified by defining a condition, which is a set of statements which shall be satisfied in order for that particular rule to apply an effect, which represents the ruleâ€™s outcome.

**Security Policy Management**:

A web runtime shall use a configured security policy as the sole basis on which access control decisions are made verify that each use of each feature is permitted by evaluating the feature request against the configured security policy. Only accept signed security policies from authorized security policy provisioning authorities support at least one security policy provisioning authority.

Android:
========

This section deals in identifying the use of security, permissions, privileges, application signing, User IDâ€™s, File access, enforcing permissions in Android manifest.xml, network interface, Package Manager, manifest permission, access controls related to Android.

**Security and Permissions**:

-   Android is a privilege-separated operating system.In which each application runs with a distinct system identity (Linux user ID and group ID).
-   Security features are provided through a "permission" mechanism that enforces restrictions on the specific operations that a particular process can perform, and per-URI permissions for
     granting ad-hoc access to specific pieces of data.

**Application Signing**:

-   All Android applications (.apk files) must be signed with a certificate, private key is held by their developer.
-   This certificate identifies the author of the application.
-   The certificate does not need to be signed by a certificate authority: it is perfectly allowable, and typical, for Android applications to use self-signed certificates.
-   This allows the system to grant or deny applications access to signature-level permissions and to grant or deny an application’s request to be given the same Linux identity as another application.

**User IDâ€™s, File access and Permissions**:

-   At install time, Android gives each package a distinct Linux user ID.
-   The identity remains constant for the duration of the package’s life on that device.
-   On a different device, the same package may have a different UID; what matters is that each package has a distinct UID on a given device.
-   By including in Android Manifest.xml one or more <uses-permission> tags declaring and enforcing the permissions that an application needs.

**Enforcing Permissions in AndroidManifest.xml**:

-   High-level permissions restricting access to entire components of the system or application can be applied through your AndroidManifest.xml
-   Activity permissions (applied to the <activity> tag) restrict who can start the associated activity. The permission is checked during Context.startActivity() and
     Activity.startActivityForResult()
-   The permissions are checked when you first retrieve a provider (if you don’t have either permission, a SecurityException will be thrown).

**Access Controller privileges**:

-   Java security has a special class called â€˜Access Controllerâ€™
-   AccessController provides static methods to perform access control checks and privileged operations.

It supports some methods such as:
* checkPermission: Checks the specified permission against the VM’s current security policy.
* doPrivileged(PrivilegedExceptionAction<T> action) Returns the result of executing the specified privileged action.
* doPrivileged(PrivilegedExceptionAction<T> action, AccessControlContext context) Returns the result of executing the specified privileged action.
* static AccessControlContext: Returns the AccessControlContext for the current Thread including the inherited access control context of the thread that spawned the current thread (recursively).

**Network Interface**:

-   getHarrdwareAddress() : Returns the hardware address of the interface, if it has one, and the user has the necessary privileges to access the address.

**Package Manager**:

-   GET_PERMISSIONS: return information about permissions in the package in permissions.
-   GET_SIGNATURES: return information about the signatures included in the package.
-   PERMISSION_DENIED: checks if the permission has not been granted to the given package.
-   PERMISSION_GRANTED: checks if the permission has been granted to the given package.
-   SIGNATURE_MATCH: if all signatures on the two packages match

**Manifest Permission**:

-   CALL_PRIVILEGED: Allows an application to call any phone number, including emergency numbers, without going through the Dialer user interface for the user to confirm the call being placed.
-   Manifest.permission_group: Permissions for direct access Account Manager, Hardware Control, Location, Messages, Network, Personal Info, Storage, System Tools.

Terminology:
------------

**Privileged Application**
A Privileged application is signed with a certificate that is in the privileged certificate store on the device. Target an application based on its Digital Certificate.

A Privileged application is an application that can override system controls and check for specific user IDs (UIDs), group IDs (GIDs), authorizations, or privileges. The access control elements are assigned by system administrators.

**Privileges** - A privilege is a discrete right that can be granted to an application. With a privilege, a process can perform an operation that would otherwise be prohibited. For example, processes cannot normally open data files without the proper file permission. Privileges are enforced at the kernel level.

**Authorizations** - An authorization is a permission for performing a class of actions that are otherwise prohibited by security policy. An authorization can be assigned to a role or user. Authorizations are enforced at the user level.

The difference between authorizations and privileges has to do with the level at which the policy of who can do what is enforced. Privileges are enforced at the kernel level. Without the proper privilege, a process cannot perform specific operations in a privileged application.

**Privilege Monitoring**: Privilege Monitoring will log privileged application activity that would fail under a standard user account. For an application to log activity you must enable Privilege Monitoring in the Application Privileges or Shell Integration sections of the policy, when you insert an application group.

**Installers**: A Privileged Application provides a policy based approach to privilege management. All users log on with standard user accounts and Privilege Application assigns the necessary rights and privileges to applications, scripts and software installers. Installers of the Privilege Application run through the console and client.

**Launcher**: The launchers of the Privilege application Policies for the users will automatically elevate these applications when they are launched.

**Policy Manager**: A Privilege Application is implemented as an extension to Group Policy, enabling policies to be managed through the standard Group Policy Management tools.

**Dashboard**: The Privileged Application can provide information related to Date, Event ID, Event Description, Username, PID, Parent PID, Policy, Application Group, Reason, Custom Token, Filename/Codebase, Type, Instances, Description, Certificate which can be shown in a Dashboard format for example to view in the form of graphs like area, bar, line and so on. Auditing and reporting capabilities can also be viewed by the help of Dashboards.
