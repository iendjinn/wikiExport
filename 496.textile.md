[[User ID and Data Management|Back to User Identity and User Data Management]]

20110321 conf call on User Identity Management
==============================================

Date: 21 Mar 2011
Time: 15:00 - 16:00 CET
Bridge: PowWowNow, PIN: 312806

Agenda:
* Discussion of the user identity management architecture
* Discussion of interfaces to the other subtopics
* Presentation of latest findings on related work

Action Items:
* Polito to provide the next release of the architecture draft
* All who are involved in state-of-the-art analysis to provide their deeper investigations focused on the architecture
* Nick to cross-check with Dave on authentication to be done locally by the browser
* All to finish their yet incomplete action items from the previous conf call

Attendees:
* Andrea and Antonio, POLITO
* Stefano, ISMB
* Nick, Impleo
* John, Oxford
* Ziran, Samsung
* Habib, Samsung
* Sven, DOCOMO
* Christian, DOCOMO
* Eelco Cramer, TNO

Discussion:
1. Architecture
* Received comments from Oxford and W3C
* Preparing a new versions with these contributions
* Oxford pointed to proxy certificates for creating federations between devices of different people
**** Every certificate infrastructure needs to have a implicit/explicit root
**** Webinos is a member of the Web and auth in the Web is done by certificates, esp. in TLS
**** Overlay network approaches using cryptographic addresses identify their nodes by their cryptographic keys; this requires cryptographic keys as well
* Kerberos-like architecture without fully implemented architecture, esp. the pre-shared keys
* W3C favours managing authorization locally which requires SSO on each client device (e.g. in the Browser)
**** This requires each client to authenticate individually

2. Other subtopics
* Overlay network
**** Needs synchronisation especially on certificates
**** Secure channel for authentication
*** Local secure channel should be due to initialisation of all own devices (e.g. shared keys)
*** Having authenticated the user with a public key is a good starting point for secure channels by TLS
*** Current AA proposal may need secureDNS to diminish certain phishing attacks
*** Simple devices may not have full SSL/SecureDNS impl onboard
**** We need to agree what are the minimum requirements
**** Overlay network using crypto identifiers maps a pub key to a specific IP Addr
*** If identities are also pub keys, after auth, a user is able to announce that his ID is associated with one or more specific nodes ïƒ  double entry network where you can give ID of user or device
*** Requires lookup between users and devices and users and IP addr
*** Similar to the philosophy of SIP
* Discovery
** Had a look at XMPP, needs deeper analysis
**** Interests are quite similar to ours
**** Is it a problem if we only want to identify a user or a device?
*** In some protocols one of the two is optional in others, like SIP, not
** Decision on technologies required: XMPP, Zeroconf, UPNP and then architecture and then decision on addressing
**** User IDM and Discovery will continue independently for a short while and syncronise later
**** Zeroconf and XMPP can be used locally and on the Internet; Zeroconf requires DNS notification
*** Looks like XMPP is the preferred candidate
* Privacy & security
** Control by user: when ID is used the user needs to be aware and be able to turn off
**** Privacy is addressed by unlinkability
***** Would be good to support partial identities

3. Stat-of-the-art
* postponed to next call due to time limitations today

Next meeting: conf call, Mon 28 Mar 11, 15h CEDT (daylight saving time!)
