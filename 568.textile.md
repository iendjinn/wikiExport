P2P and NAT types
=================

The [[Overlay networking model]] aims to provide a logical connection between devices (and servers) regardless of the underlying network topology. This includes setting up UDP and TCP connections that traverse firewalls and network address translation (NAT). The lack of standardization for NAT creates problems, but luckily NAT vendors are responding to the rising demand for P2P applications such as VOIP and online gaming. Some useful links:

Newer consumer NAT devices e.g. "Belkin N Wireless Modem Router" include support for setting up peer to peer UDP and TCP connections with address restricted cone NAT or port restricted cone NAT. Corporate NATs, on the other hand, often use symmetric NAT with a new random mapping from the internal to external port for each connection. The IETF Behavior Engineering for Hindrance Avoidance (behave) working group is working on specifications for NATs that function in as a deterministic a fashion as possible.

Next Steps
----------

For webinos we will need to experiment with mechanisms for establishing P2P UDP and TCP connections that work across well behaved NATs. This is needed to enable applications to expose services for others to use independently of whether the devices are on the same local network or are remote and generally involving traversal of multiple NAT boundaries.

The next step will be to develop software libraries for such P2P connections and to integrate them as part of a browser plugin solution for P2P messaging. The natcheck and nattest code linked above will provide the starting point for this work. We will also need server-side support, and I plan to develop this initially as a standalone server, and later to integrate it as part of my HTTP/Web Sockets server (Arena).

### Advertising Services and Discovery

Webinos applications will expose services for others to use. These need to be advertised so that they can be discovered. This should be possible both through direct connections e.g. multicast DNS, and also remotely. We will need to explore ways to enable web page scripts and web widgets to listen for service requests, e.g. through a worker thread implemented in script as a web worker, or as part of a browser plugin used to implement the overlay networking model.

Your devices could (if you so chose to) advertise the URL for your social agent (see next section). This would make it easy to find out more information starting from a basic mDNS search.

### P2P and Social Agents

The need for external servers to facilitate P2P connections can be combined with ideas for distributed social networks, where each user would have one or more URLs for webinos agents that can be used for:

-   discovering information about that user’s services and context
-   setting up P2P connections to services provided on behalf of that user
-   synchronizing shared state across the user’s devices
-   representing the user’s social network and information on those users
-   passing messages to the user’s social connections
-   implementing trust relationships based upon authentication and access control

Thus, to get access to information and services, you would first have to authenticate yourself as a friend, colleague or member of the public, as according to the trust models established by that user. The services provided to or on behalf of that user represent a huge opportunity for application developers.

Note: we may want to look at ways to map email addresses to the URLs for the social agents as a convenient way to access those agents, e.g. the WebFinger proposal.

#### Distributed Search

We should also consider the role of distributed search and how to realize that in a way that respects privacy and trust relationships. One solution is to export the problem to a proprietary search engine like Google, but another is to implement efficient distributed search using server-modules and building upon algorithms like "Distributed Hash Tables":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributed_hash_table. In many cases, the social agent would be hosted by the user’s Internet Service Provider using open source modules that also implement distributed search. Each user would thus pay for his part of the system.

### WebFinger

A mechanism using your email address for "Personal Web Discovery":http://www.abstractioneer.org/2009/04/personal-web-discovery.html

-   http://code.google.com/p/webfinger/
-   http://webfinger.org/

This involves a hack whereby you take the domain name part of an email address and use it to generate an HTTP URL that in turn can be used for a query for metadata for that email address.

### DNS Service Discovery

Another approach is to make use of conventional DNS for service discovery ("DNS-SD":http://www.dns-sd.org/) e.g. by adding SRV and TXT records that can be used for limited amounts of metadata and pointers to servers for further information. This would work well for Internet Service Providers who could provide a query API on behalf of their users. This is attractive as it also works well with "multicast DNS":http://www.multicastdns.org/ for local discovery, and something that I’ve already implemented as part of a cross browser plugin.
