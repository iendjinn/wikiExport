Introduction
============

In task 3.4, webinos phase 2 API specifications, the development of the application programming interface specifications (APIs) has continued in order to make the desired functionality available to webinos applications. The phase 1 API specifications created in task 3.2 have been further developed and new API specifications have been added.

Updates done
------------

The work is based on experiences from webinos implementations in WP4 and WP5, updated use cases/requirements in WP2, evolving webinos architecture specification in task 3.3 and progress in W3C standardization. The work done includes for example:

-   Updating all API specifications to align with the latest W3C Web IDL-specification and API specification style.
-   Assuring that all API specifications are aligned with the real WP4 API implementations.
-   Removing APIs specified in task 3.2 but found that we definitively donâ€™t need.
-   Specifying, or referring, new APIs found that we need.
-   Aligning with latest versions of referred W3C or other API standards.
-   Continuing providing feedback to W3C standardization, working with task 8.1.

Overview of webinos phase 2 API categories
------------------------------------------

One of the key elements of webinos is that the framework provides means to bind to a service object in a remote execution environment. The webinos Service Discovery API defines how a service is discovered and how an application can bind to a remote service. The service object will act as proxy for sending/receiving events to/from the remote peer and hides the complexity of sending/receiving message between the peers in a trusted manner. This mechanism is not limited to webinos defined APIs but is also available for the APIs defined by W3C and referenced by webinos as well as for user defined APIs. For example, an application can use the webinos Service Discovery API to search for a geolocation service on another device and then access this service through the standard W3C Geolocation API.

The webinos APIs can be divided into a number of categories:

-   **Webinos core interface:** For example the webinos core interface that defines the webinos API namespace and gives information about the user’s personal zone.

-   **Service discovery and access:** Allows applications to discover services/applications on other devices or on network servers and access these remote services.

-   **HW Resources APIs:** APIs allowing applications to access information and functionality relating to device HW resources such as GPS, camera, NFC, SIM and smart card readers, sensors, etc.

-   **Application Data APIs:** APIs allowing applications read and write access to application capabilites such as contact items, calender information, messages, media files, etc.

-   **Communication APIs:** APIs allowing applications to communicate with other applications in the same or another device.

-   **Application execution APIs:** APIs allowing webinos applications to manage its execution or launch other webinos and native applications.

-   **User profile and context APIs:** APIs allowing applications access to user profile data and user context.

-   **Security and Privacy APIs:** APIs related to the security model for webinos.

All webinos phase 2 API specifications are available here: "Webinos phase 2 Device APIs":http://dev.webinos.org/deliverables/wp3/Deliverable34/

Given the sensitive nature of the data to which these APIs grant access, the APIs specified are either secure and privacy-enabling by design or implemented so that access to APIs are controlled by the Webinos security framework specified in D3.6.

Further work
------------

The webinos project will continuously align with ongoing API standardization in W3C and elsewhere. For example, the "W3C System Applications Working Group":http://www.w3.org/2012/05/sysapps-wg-charter.html is starting up and is chartered to define a runtime environment, security model, and associated APIs for building Web applications with comparable capabilities to native applications. This work is very relevant for webinos. Furthermore, W3C is also standardizing "Web Intents":http://www.w3.org/TR/web-intents/ and Web Intents based APIs and webinos should explore this technology as it is maturing.

However, webinos should not only reuse standard specifications from W3C or elsewhere but also collaborate with standardization organizations and impact standardization work in progress. This is done within WP 8.1.

The repository for webinos APIs that are further updated is here: "webinos latest Device APIs":http://dev.webinos.org/specifications/new/.

Document structure
------------------

In addition to the tangible API specifications, which of course is the main part of the delivery, this delivery contains informative sections which are:

-   Overview of the Web Application API Landscape.
-   Background information on all API specifications included in the delivery.
-   Results of the "Web Intents" for webinos investigation.
