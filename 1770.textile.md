Background - Analytics
======================

Introduction
------------

### Definition of analytics

Analytics is the epitomy of Business Intelligence (BI) science born by the overwhelming wealth of information in the cloud and the shockingly detailed digital trail left throughout the user journey. It is a mix of advanced statistics and data mining techniques which combine, homogenize and translate this wealth of digital information from disparate sources, into actionable business intelligence.

Applications of Analytics solutions include:
* hardware/network/application troubleshooting,
* hardware/network/application performance optimization,
* usability testing,
* Security analysis/forensics
* marketing:
- usage tracking
- recommendations,
- targeting,
- campaign performance tracking & management,
- sales tracking

Analytics solutions are also categorized based on the available measuring/probing points: device (on chip), network (transport, IP & DPI), web (http), application (in app), app store (sales). Since the webinos platform will reside between the transport layer of the network and the actual application (as part of the web run-time) the closest category is "application (in app) analytics".

### Key issues & challenges of analytics solutions

-   visibility: an analytics solution is inherently limited by the data that can be collected e.g. an application has no "visibility" about what the user is doing with other applications.
-   device issues: caching (device caching consumes memory), processing cycles and device battery,
-   data homogenization across devices and services: different devices and platforms produce different kind of data that need to be "normalized" in order to be comparable.
-   privacy issues of data gathered
-   data ownership issues of analytics (who owns the insights about the users data?)

It is also important to mention that the value (and main challenge) of an analytics solution is in the actual analysis (define meaningful and actionable ‘recipies’) & reporting. This however depends on the actual BI application. Therefore, at platform level, the aim is only to provide the means to easily collect and log information.

To this end, webinos is a game changer from existing platforms in that it enables:
* a uniform interface for extraction of information across many different device domains; car, pc, home media, mobile
* a uniform interface for extraction of information across service domains.
* webinos has a strong security framework which provides a solid mechanism for ensuring that privacy control is in the hands of the user.
* webinos authentication mechanism enables tracking of usage across devices / services without the need for separate logins

The combination of these enablers give webinos a big advantage of end-to-end visibility across devices, services, networks and usage contexts.

### Analytics solutions high level architecture/work-flow

-   define metering rules (what/when/how to capture)
-   deploy metering rules
-   capture/metering based on metering rules and privacy/security settings
-   transfer and store data to (log)
-   homogenization (if necessary across devices)
-   transfer to analysis engine/repository
-   production of actual analytics processing - report

Note: The word _Metering_ refers to the low-level process of collecting/measuring & recording data points and event triggers, i.e. without any kind of further processing,
normalization or analysis. _Metrics_ are therefore the directly measurable events and data points. _Analytics_ refer to the product(s) of the statistical analysis of those metrics.

The architecture can be divided in three parts based on different sets of implementation requirements:
* platform: definition and deployment of metering rules, data capture and local (within personal network) storage
* implementation: data homogenization and transfer to analysis engine (and potentially to external repository)
* application dependent: data mining and statistical analysis for the generation of business intelligence and reporting

To this end, WP3 activities are only concerned about **platform** related issues. **Implementation** and **Application dependent** issues may be investigated as part of a WP5 proof-of-concept application implementation.

### References to requirements

The need to provide support for analytics at platform level has been identified in the following webinos requirements (see Deliverable D02.1 Use cases & requirements).

  ---------------- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  **ID**           **Description**
  WOS-US-7.4       Privacy Controls and Analytics for Corporations and Small Businesses
  WOS-UC-TA8-013   Collecting Analytics from webinos Applications
  WOS-UC-TA8-014   End User cross Platform Privacy Analytics in Healthcare, Smart Grids and Home Environments
  ---------------- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Scope
-----

### in scope

-   Identify an initial list of "meterable" data points and events based on existing list of APIs
-   define metering rules (what/when/how to capture)
-   define necessary privacy/security policies
-   data capture/metering based on metering rules and privacy/security policies
-   deploy mechanism for metering rules (how is the metering client/logging mechanism getting updated with new rules over-the-air)
-   transfer and store data to (log)

### out of scope

deferred to second phase:
* provision for complex metering rules which may involve more than one-state, data point (pattern/sequence signatures)

May be implemented as part of proof-of-concept applications (WP5):
* homogenization of data across device and services (if necessary)
* data transfer to analysis engine/external repository
* implementation of an actual analytics processing & reporting engine

Review of State of the Art
--------------------------

Existing analytics platform provider are split broadly in two categories: web and application-based. For mobile telecoms three more categories exist, namely: mobile messaging, SIM and network.
The categories are defined based on the metering software touch-point, i.e. its visibility in terms of available data and event triggers.

**Main proposition:** The CrowdLogger is a encrypted anonymous web query logging system built for research purposes on web search. It comes as a Firefox and Chrome browser extension:

*Core product:**The CrowdLogger highlights are:

** User control: The web query logs are stored on the local device and can be deleted by the user
* Privacy: The aggregated data is encrypted and anonymous - only data appearing in 5 or more logs can be decrypted, and no web queries are linked

It is installed by downloading and activating the browser extension. It can also be uninstalled. At the moment it is in a research stage, and analytics data can not be released. The anonymous web query log data on might become released for research purposes only.

**Platform targets:** Firefox and Chrome (web bowsers)

**Data ownership:** The user is in control over the local data. The research team is in control of the anonymised data.

**Type of analytics:** Web query analytics to improve web search technologies

Recommendations from state of the art
-------------------------------------

Currently, Localytics (http://localytics.com) is the only commercial end-to-end application analytics platform provider (both client libraries & server components for in-house hosting). Two other companies which offered similar solutions are: Appclix (closed beta since late-2010 no trace of activity since) and Motally (purchased by Nokia 4Q2010 and discontinued products).

Localytics is also the only solution which offers a public version of the source code under a BSD-derived open source license (http://wiki.localytics.com/doku.php?id=the_localytics_modified_bsd_license).

Due to the lack of openly available code bases, technical specifications or standardization efforts to date, webinos could potentially offer a reference open implementation for such systems. To head start the specification and development of the metering/analytics functionality webinos can leverage the open source version of the Localytics code base.

Still no data available for review. (Krishna Bangalore)
