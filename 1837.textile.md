API specification update due to new W3C widl specification
==========================================================

Introduction
------------

Web IDL (â€widlâ€) defines the language we use to define our APIs. Since task 3.2 W3C has updated the Web IDL specification.

Here is the latest W3C Web IDL specification: "Web IDL W3C Editorâ€™s Draft": http://dev.w3.org/2006/webapi/WebIDL/.

We need to align our API specifications with the latest Web IDL specification.

widlproc
--------

This is the tool we use to generate the APIs specs from their Web IDL definitions. It is a command-line utility that transforms Web IDL fragments into XML.

See http://dev.webinos.org/redmine/projects/t3-2/wiki/Tool_Setup_and_Usage for information on how to use git and widlproc for creating API specifications.

Process for each specification editor
-------------------------------------

The new APIs are being edited in the "newwebidl" branch of the http://dev.webinos.org/git/t3-2.git repository. This repository contains widlproc executables for Linux, Mac and Windows but it is intially empty on API widl files.

1.  Create a local clone of the specification repository. The repository URL is http://dev.webinos.org/git/t3-2.git , and checkout the "newwebidl" branch (git checkout newwebidl)
2.  Make necessary updates according to the "Changes" section below.
3.  When specification generation is verfified to work commit and push it to the API specification repository.

Public repositories for then generated HTML API specifications
--------------------------------------------------------------

Public respository for Webinos API specifications according to old outdated widl-specification is here: "Webinos API specifications according to outdated widl specification":http://dev.webinos.org/specifications/draft/.

New repository for Webinos API specifications according to latest widl specification is here: "Phase 2 API specifications":http://dev.webinos.org/specifications/new/

Changes
-------

### â€modulesâ€ removed

â€œmoduleâ€ is no longer a valid keyword for Web IDL. All Webinos API specifications used â€moduleâ€. To adapt to that change:
# remove the wrapping module Foo { } declaration in the Web IDL
# set the name of the overall API using name in the first block of comments
# the first block of comments should start with /**<p>A description of the API</p>
# APIs that refered to other modules definitions (Ã  la webinoscore::) should remove the said namespace

### The raises / getraises / setraises keywords are no longer valid

See: http://dev.w3.org/2006/webapi/WebIDL/#idl-exceptions and http://dvcs.w3.org/hg/domcore/raw-file/default/Overview.html#domexception. Re-using DOMException with a specific type is now preferred. In the descriptive text it should be stated which exception is throwed in certain situations.

### Reusing DOMError instead of per API errors

As much as possible, re-use "DOMError objects":http://dvcs.w3.org/hg/domcore/raw-file/default/Overview.html#error-types-table in error callbacks instead of minting new errors for each API. We should only define a new interface if the error somehow needs to transmit more than a name.

### Dictionaries

Dictionaries should be used to define bag of properties. Interfaces had to be used before.
See: http://dev.w3.org/2006/webapi/WebIDL/#idl-dictionaries.

### New keyword â€Partialâ€

Applied to interfaces and dictionaries, replaces what used to be done through the unofficial [Supplemental] extended attribute.

### â€Callerâ€ renamed to renamed "legacycallerâ€œ

Has been marked as only for encoding legacy APIs. Might be removed overall in the next version.

### Callbacks

There is now a specific mechanism to describe callback functions (using the â€œcallbackâ€ keyword) that should be used instead of [NoInterfaceObject] interfaces.

### Constants and enums

Instead of using numerical constants (e.g. for error codes), the preferred approach is to use strings; the list of valid strings can now be defined using the â€œenumâ€ keyword: enum Foo { "bar", "baz" };

### Infinite values

For values that need to accept Infinity as a value, the type "unrestricted float" or "unrestricted double" has to be used.

### Union types

Where one need a type that is a composition of several other types, a new syntax for union types is now available.
