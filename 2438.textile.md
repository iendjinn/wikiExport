Specification

[JPL]: If the previous section is not going to be part of the specification, we can’t reference it here in this way.
<span style="background:green">[PV] If the previous section is not going to be included in the deliverable, I think section editor or main editor should take care of copy and paste it. Assuming that background inclusion is not out of the question.</span>
<span style="background:lightgreen">[SM] Background section no more needed</span>

As anticipated in [[Conceptual_Architecture|conceptual architecture]], the webinos platform’s security and privacy requirements are achieved through the definition of an enforcement system based on access control and privacy policies.
While the access control policies are discussed in the previous section, this one focus on privacy and data handling specifications.
The following diagram depicts a brief overview of the mechanisms involving privacy and data handling policies. The definition and usage of the shown elements, such as _policy.xml_, _exceptions.xml_ and _manifest.xml_ is reported in the following sections.

### Data handling

Data handling refers to the management of user and application data by applications. [[Spec_-_Privacy_Policy|PrimeLife]] defines in its "Report on design and implementation" ([[Spec_-_Privacy_Policy|PrimeLifeRDI]]) two different entities involved in data handling:

-   **_data controller_**: which in our case is the application side. Is the entity that receives the data.
-   **_data subject_**: which in the webinos scenario is the PZ, therefore the PZP and the PZH. Is the entity that holds the data.

In webinos data handling policies and preferences are expressed using the PrimeLife Privacy Language (PPL) and the P3P ontology, particularly the authorization tags also described in [[Spec_-_Privacy_Policy#PrimeLifeRDI|PrimeLifeRDI]]. The definition of Authorizations, Obligations and Provisional actions elements come from this same document.

Data handling policies are defined by the application in its manifest and data handling preferences are defined by the user in a policy.xml file. They both are composed of authorizations and obligations.

h4. Authorizations

Authorizations are the first part of data handling where preferences/intentions are declared.
In the policy they are represented by an _<AuthorizationsSet>_ element whose child _<AuthzUseForPurpose>_, contains a list of purposes (_<Purpose>_) authorized to use the information.
In the following example the _<Purpose>_ tag specifies that only the pseudonymous analysis is allowed.

<pre><code class="xml">
<AuthorizationsSet>
 <AuthzUseForPurpose>
 <Purpose>http://www.w3.org/2002/01/P3Pv1/pseudo-analysis</Purpose>
 </AuthzUseForPurpose>
</AuthorizationsSet>
</code></pre>

The purposes associated to the URIs are defined in P3P 1.1 specification ([[Spec_-_Privacy_Policy#P3P11|P3P11]]).

#### Obligations

Obligations are a subset of data handling where additional constraints are declared. They are specified inside _<Obligation>_ elements, which on their turn contain a _<TriggersSet>_ element describing the events that trigger the obligation, an _<Action>_ element describing the action to be performed, and a _<Validity>_ element describing the validity time frame of the obligation. Set of obligations, can be expressed through an _<ObligationsSet>_ element.

Moreover, in this other section of this example it is required the data deletion (using the _<ActionDeletePersonalData/>_ tag) within five days (using _<Start>_ and _<MaxDelay>_ tags).

What does this 5-day requirement refer to?
<span style="background:green">[PV] This was a part of a bigger example that has been divided. The 5 days is an obligation that states that data must be deleted from the application in 5 days. Polito can be more precise, I think.</span>

<pre><code class="xml">
<ObligationsSet>
 <Obligation>
 <TriggersSet>
 <TriggerAtTime>
 <Start><StartNow/></Start>
 <MaxDelay>
 <Duration>P0Y0M5DT0H0M0S</Duration>
 </MaxDelay>
 </TriggerAtTime>
 </TriggersSet>
 <ActionDeletePersonalData/>
 </Obligation>
</ObligationsSet>
</code></pre>

#### Provisional Actions

Provisional actions are used to bind the authorization set and the obligations.
Moreover, a brief description in a human readable language can be provided by developers for each feature. An attribute named _language_ for this tag identifies which language the description has been written in. Required feature description will be displayed during the installation process, depending on the display capacities of the device. It is recommended that devices display _at least_ the first 140 characters.

<pre><code class="xml">
 <ProvisionalAction>
 <AttributeValue>http://webinos.org/geolocation</AttributeValue>
 <AttributeValue>#pseudo-analysisDHP</AttributeValue>
 <DeveloperProvidedDescription language="EN">
 The geolocation feature is required by this application in order to customise search results.
 </DeveloperProvidedDescription>
 </ProvisionalAction>
</code></pre>

[JPL] I just made some changes here - can you check that this makes sense for #pseudo-analysisDHP ? If this is correct, it might be worth updating the example at the end of this spec, too. I think this example makes more sense…
<span style="background:green">[PV] It does. Changing the last example accordingly…</span>

### Policy matching and evaluation

The policy manager of the PZP where is located the required resource must decide whether to allow or deny resource access. This decision is the result of an automated matching procedure between the application policies and the user policies.
Application policies are composed of access control policies and data handling policies.
User policies are composed of access control policies and data handling preferences.
Privacy-related allow/deny decision is the result of the matching between data subject’s data handling preferences and data controller’s data handling policies.

#### Policy matching

Policy matching is required to map an access control request onto an application and set of policies. It can be divided into three sections:

1.  XACML access control (rows 2-9 in the following example). This is the usual matching of XACML policies to application required features.
2.  PPL tags that not fall within data handling obligations. For example data handling authorization (rows 11-15 in the following example) and provisional action (rows 32-35). Matching algorithms are the same as for XACML access control.
3.  Data handling obligations (rows 16-30 in the following example). They are different from XACML obligations and require different matching algorithms.

<pre><code class="xml">
<Policy>
 <Target>
 <Subject>
 <Subject-match attr="distributor-key-fingerprint" match="[the fingerprint of the application distributor]"/>
 </Subject>
 </Target>
 <Rule effect="prompt-blanket">
 <Resource-match attr="device-cap" match="http://webinos.org/geolocation"/>
 </Rule>
 <DataHandlingPreference PolicyId="#pseudo-analysisDHP">
 <AuthorizationsSet>
 <AuthzUseForPurpose>
 <Purpose>http://www.w3.org/2002/01/P3Pv1/pseudo-analysis</Purpose>
 </AuthzUseForPurpose>
 </AuthorizationsSet>
 <ObligationsSet>
 <Obligation>
 <TriggersSet>
 <TriggerAtTime>
 <Start>
 <StartNow/>
 </Start>
 <MaxDelay>
 <Duration>P0Y0M7DT0H0M0S</Duration>
 </MaxDelay>
 </TriggerAtTime>
 </TriggersSet>
 <ActionDeletePersonalData/>
 <Obligation>
 <ObligationsSet>
 </DataHandlingPreference>
 <ProvisionalAction>
 <AttributeValue>http://www.webinos.org/geolocation</AttributeValue>
 <AttributeValue>#pseudo-analysisDHP</AttributeValue>
 </ProvisionalAction>
</Policy>
</code></pre>

#### Obligations matching

Exact match algorithm can’t be used matching obligations. Data subject obligations (in data handling preference) and data controller obligations (in data handling policy) must be compared evaluating which obligations are more restrictive.
If data controller obligations are not less restrictive than data subject obligations, it means that data subject obligations are not violated, so there is a match.
If data controller obligations are less restrictive than data subject obligations, there is a mismatch that must be notified to the user to decide whether to send the requested data or discard the transaction.
Obligations are composed of actions (row 28 in the previous example) and triggers (rows 18-27 in the previous example), so an obligation is more restrictive if it is more restrictive in both, actions and triggers. All triggers in the preferences must be in the policy, but the policy can specify more triggers.
What "more restrictive" means depends on matching rules defined in the matching engine implementation.
For example a data handling policy ensuring data deletion is more restrictive if time specified in the _<Duration>_ tag is shorter than data handling preferences requirement (row 24). It can be more difficult to define the notion of "more restrictive" for example when the obligation require to send periodically an email to inform the user about access to his data. Notifications sent with a shorter time interval can be considered more restrictive or can be considered spam.

### Object synchronization concerning privacy

Object synchronisation (as defined in the [[Glossary]]) is required for general access control, not just for privacy.

The decision to allow or deny an access request is generated from the matching engine and calculated at run-time. Hence, from the privacy perspective, policies must be synchronised across the personal zone in order to make sure that they are consistently followed on all devices.

The main idea is to have an _exceptions.xml_ file that goes alongside with the existing _policy.xml_. Synchronization will treat these policy files as follows:

-   **_policy.xml_**: will be synchronized across the whole personal zone. It is the same for every device and it gathers inside itself all the preferences that the user has specified.
-   **_exceptions.xml_**: is an exception file that specifies particular preferences for a specific device.

Synchronization conflicts are settled by a `master copy` of the _policy.xml_ file, stored in the PZH.

The exceptions file is a XACML-like file where strong denial rules are specified that target resources on the local device. In order to maintain consistency, the file is uploaded from the PZP to the PZH. A version control mechanism should also be implemented, in order to synchronize it to the latest copy of the local _exception.xml_ file. On the other hand, synchronization is never considered from PZH to PZP.
In order to maintain persistence and being consistent on modifications, the _exceptions.xml_ file should be editable just from the PZP that owns it. The reason why it is also uploaded to the PZH is because it must be displayable from the policy editor on the PZH. Uploading it, helps to understand why a request is denied on a device, from the Personal Zone Hub policy administration interface, without requiring editing/displaying it on to the device.

#### Manifests synchronization and usage

In order to allow data handling policies and data handling preferences matching when calling a remote API, the called PZP must have the application data handling policies.

Inside the Personal Zone, all manifests of all installed applications are synchronized across devices. This means that a device has all the manifests that are installed on all other devices, in order to be ready to answer to a request to that comes from the same personal zone. The synchronization of an application’s manifest is done immediately after the application’s installation. In case of installation of a newer version of an already installed application on another device the conflict is settled by separately storing different versions of the manifest.
When calling an API outside the Personal Zone, an information concerning the application manifest is attached to the call. The policy manager of the calling PZP intercepts the request, attaches the manifest information, and forwards the request to the called PZP.

Attaching manifest information does not necessarily mean that the manifest itself is attached. If the application is published on a public repository, its manifest is available and it is feasible to attach the application URI instead. This URI, allows the called policy manager of the PZP to retrieve the manifest from it.
If the application has a customized version of the manifest or if it is not available on a public accessible URI, the completed version of the manifest is sent.
On the other hand, a test application could also send a request without anything attached as a complementary information. By default this is strongly discouraged and the behavior would be to deny by default anonymous applications.

To sum up, it is possible to attach to the request:
* **_application URI_**: this is for well know applications, published on public repositories. Therefore, the manifest is available.
* **_application manifest_**: the whole manifest is attached if it is a customized version of an existing manifest, or if the application does not have a public location to post the manifest.
* **_nothing_**: just for test purposes. In this case the application is considered as _anonymous_ and default preferences would drop requests.

Below there is an example of the JSON message attachment.

<pre><code class="json">
{
 class:"URI",
 value:"http://example.org/appManifest.xml"
}
</code>
</pre>

<pre><code class="json">
{
 class:"Manifest",
 value:"<widget>…</widget>"
}
</code>
</pre>

In the followings, there are three sequence diagrams that explains synchronization and requests handling.

![]({width:1200px}Privacy-_requests_across_same_personal_zone.png)
![]({width:1200px}Privacy-_requests_across_different_personal_zones.png)

||_.**Use**|_.**Language**|_.**Synchronization**|_.**Editability**|
|_policy.xml_|contains all the policies and the rules related to all APIs of targeted devices inside the personal zone,
with the opportunity to specify, through some attributes, combination of rules device/application/APIs related |reduced XACML|non-blind synchronization across the personal zone|editable by policy editor|
|_exceptions.xml_|contains strong restrictions related to the device where it’s stored. It’s copied on the PZH with informative intent.
It has higher priority to the _policy.xml_ file, because its restrictions are device specific.|reduced XACML|version controlled and uploaded on PZH, but never synchronized|editable only by policy editor on PZP|
|_manifests_|contains the _feature_ tags, that specify which APIs and data the application wants to retrieve,
and the data handling policies that are a declaration statement of the application intents about gathered data|Access Control Policies: XACML-like, data handling policies: PPL tags|synchronized across the whole personal zone|not editable|

#### Example of _exceptions.xml_

The following example is meant to show a specific deny rule, in this case is the dial of the camera, to every application.

<pre><code class="xml">
<policy-set combine="deny-overrides">
 <policy combine="first-applicable">
 <target/>

<rule effect="deny">
 <condition>
 <resource-match attr="api-feature" match="http://www.w3.org/ns/api-perms/mediacapture"/>
 </condition>
 </rule>

<rule effect="permit"/>
 </policy>

<policy>
 […]
 </policy>

[…]

</policy-set>
</code></pre>

#### Example of _policy.xml_

In the following example a policy that involves a specific user, a device and targets a specific application.

<pre><code class="xml">

<policy-set combine="deny-overrides">
 <policy combine="first-applicable">
 <target>
 <subject>
 <subject-match attr="id" match="appID"/>
 <subject-match attr="version" match="1.0"/>
 <subject-match attr="user-id" match="pzh.isp.com/jessica@example.com/Jessica’s+Mobile/App "/>
 </subject>
 </target>

<rule effect="deny">
 <condition combine="or">
 <resource-match attr="api-feature" match="http://www.w3.org/ns/api-perms/contacts.read"/>
 </condition>
 </rule>

<rule effect="permit">
 […]
 </rule>

<rule effect="deny" />
 </policy>
</policy-set>
</code></pre>

Widget manifest example
-----------------------

In the example below an example concerning the widget manifest is provided.
In order to bind the data handling policies with the related obligation, a provisional action took place. If there is more than one to be binded, the _<ProvisionalActions>_ tag must be used.

<pre><code class="xml">
<widget>
 <feature name="http://webinos.org/geolocation" required="true" />
 <DataHandlingPolicy PolicyId="#pseudo-analysisDHP">
 <AuthorizationsSet>
 <AuthzUseForPurpose>

 <TriggerAtTime>
 <Start>
 <StartNow/>
 </Start>
