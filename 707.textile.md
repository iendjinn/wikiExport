API/Interfaces for integrating the extensions into the webinos runtime
======================================================================

The following functional interfaces have to be embedded by the extension developer.

interface for loading an extensions
-----------------------------------

The extension must implement a pre-defined funtion which is the hook for the webinos runtime to interact with it (comparable to the NP_Initialize() in NPAPI or the init() in Node.js). This function will also

interfaces for exposing attributes, properties and functions of the extension to the application
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The extension must expose in a pre-defined way the attributes, properties and functions which shall be accessible by applications. This is basically a directory, which maps native components to components accessible by the app developer.

interfaces for emitting extension specific events
-------------------------------------------------

An extension should be able to emit events, on which applications can subscribe to. The mechanism how an extension developer can define and invoke events must be specified inside webinos.
