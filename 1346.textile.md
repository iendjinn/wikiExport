Assumptions during implementation
=================================

TLS & Device Authentication
---------------------------

-   The PZH acts as a CA for each PZP.
-   We’re assuming that everyone has a PZP to hand at all times - this can be used for authorisation.
-   We’re currently assuming that a device pairing protocol exists for people making an initial connection (e.g. two people in the same room communicating the first time)
-   We’re assuming that PZH certificates are public, and as a result, we’re removing personal information from them. In phase 2, we might consider a privacy-feature such as multiple PZH certificates.
-   We’re doing a pre-TLS protocol to obtain certificates for who we’re talking to.

Authenticating RPC messages
---------------------------

-   We assume that the OS can provide integrity for messages appearing at the PZP from the local browser/widget runtime.
