Apps Services Components - Introduction
=======================================

This brief discussion paper attempts to help frame some of the architectural and naming issues we need to resolve quickly within webinos.

Assumptions
-----------

-   A webinos application can make use of media assets, programming assets and services help on other devices, as well as the device the current application is running on.
-   As far as a user is concerned they manually trigger an **application** and this is, in and of itself a significant security event, in that it implies **intent to execute**
-   Web sites and widgets can currently make use of **external assets** even under a same origin policy, specifically
    -   media assets, e.g. Jpgs
    -   code assets, e.g. script tags
-   The current default web and widget operating model is that a web/widget runs on a device, whicch is owned by (permissioned by) the owner of the device

Documenting different dependent elements
----------------------------------------

-   Externally hosted code component, executed locally - e.g. remote script tag
-   Locally hosted code component, executed locally, with integrity checking - e.g script packaged in a widget
-   Externally hosted **service** - e.g. a webserver exposing some restful functions
-   Locally hosted **service** - e.g. an local API
-   Locally hosted **service** - e.g. an local web service

Big questions
-------------

-   What is the difference between a script tag and a widget to which another widget can communicate
-   What is the difference between a script tag and an API -
    -   must an API have a security impact - is a script tag just logic code?
-   If a widgetA exposes a messaging interface to another widgetB - eg GetStuff. And widget A makes use of an API (e.g. GetContacts() ) and widget A exposes this via GetStuff. When widget B makes use or GetStuff (implicitly GetContacts()) how is the trust and permissioning to be considered.
-   What is the different between a local web server and a script tag and an API

Solution
--------

### Identity and integrity of dependent components

When we webinos application run - it runs with a level of trust.
The application that is running must be able to trust its dependent components

Fundamentally, when any connection is made between programmatic (and media?) resources the calling application and the policy that underpins it must be able to attest to the identity and integrity of the component it connects to.

For example: a widget could make use of, all of:

1.  a local script
2.  a remote script
3.  a local web services
4.  a remote web service
5.  a local api

From a trust perspective - should we imaging all these depenencencies equivalent - as they introduce similar risks to execution

### Interface dependency and Implementation dependency

Should we describe (for security and packaging) both interface and implementation

For example, an API may implement contacts

-   it may have a V1 local implementation on the device
-   a V2 local implementation on device (improved with bug fixes)
-   a V1 implementation on a remote web server

From a running code perspective - interface dependency tells you whether it will compile - or for an interpreted script if you hit a syntax problem. Implementation dependency tells you whether it works as expected - a semantic problem

From a security perspective - interface and implementation dependency imply security issues of different depths.

-   if you know an application accesses contacts you are able to estimate risk from a data privacy perspective
-   if you further know that the api access network contacts
    -   you know it has further privallges - access to network
    -   access to your centralised contact db may have different implications to you from a risk perspective (i can lose my phone contacts but not my master copy for example)

### Application and Service

This has been discussed a few times, I am not yet fully clear if there is - of if we need to make a distinction

Different dimensions of analysis:

-   Background running: do they have their own "process", it it capable of running in the background
-   Autostart: does this background process autostart - or can it run only in response to a client request.
-   UI: does this element have its own user interface - or it it data api only
-   otherâ€¦.
