Accessing the web interface of the PZH and authenticating the user
------------------------------------------------------------------

<div class="uml">
title Accessing the web interface of the PZH and authenticating the user

actor Alice
participant Browser
participant PZH
participant IdP

autonumber
Alice -> Browser : Visit PZH Login URL
Browser -> PZH : Request login page
PZH -> Browser : Request user OpenID credentials
Alice -> Browser : login details
Browser -> IdP : OpenID login process…
IdP -> Browser : OpenID Credentials
Browser -> PZH : OpenID Credentials
PZH -> Browser : Success! Redirect to PZH landing page

</div>
Creating a PZH
--------------

<div class="uml">
title create PZH

actor User as u
participant "PZH Farm" as farm
box #ivory
 participant "New PZH" as pzh
 participant "CertificatenManager" as cm
end box

autonumber
u -> farm : authenticate
create pzh
farm -> pzh : create new PZH
create cm
pzh -> cm : generate connection certificates
pzh -> cm : generate CA certificate
pzh -> cm : generate signed certificate

</div>
Adding a new device to a personal zone
--------------------------------------

### Through the web interface

This is a bit rough - need to check the OpenID stuff (it’s not right at the moment)

Can this be integrated with other diagrams for TLS, OpenID, etc?

<div class="uml">

actor Alice
participant Browser
participant NewDevice
participant NewPZP
participant PZH
participant IdP

activate Browser
autonumber
 User OpenID login process 

Alice -> Browser : Visit PZH Login URL
activate PZH
Browser -> PZH : Request login page
PZH -> Browser : Request user OpenID credentials
Alice -> Browser : login details
activate IdP
Browser -> IdP : OpenID login process…
IdP -> Browser : OpenID Credentials
Browser -> PZH : OpenID Credentials
deactivate IdP
PZH -> Browser : Success! Redirect to PZH landing page

 Add new device 

Alice -> Browser : Click "add new device"
Browser -> PZH : Call addDevice.html
PZH -> PZH : Generate new device token, QR Code
PZH -> Browser : token, QR Code image
/’ Browser -> Alice : display token and QR Code image ’/
Alice -> NewDevice : install PZP software
NewDevice -> NewDevice : install PZP
activate NewPZP
Alice -> NewPZP : open configuration
NewPZP -> Alice : request PZH url and token
Alice -> Alice : take picture of QR code, or copy token text
deactivate Browser
Alice -> NewPZP : token, PZH URL
NewPZP -> NewPZP : create private key and self-signed certificate?
NewPZP -> PZH : TLS connection established using (self-signed?, PZH device cert)
NewPZP -> PZH : token
PZH -> PZH : check token validity
PZH -> PZH : remove token from valid list

 Issue certificate 

PZH -> PZH : create PZP certificate, add to list of known devices
PZH -> NewPZP : certificate
PZH -> NewPZP : terminate connection
NewPZP -> PZH : TLS connection established using (PZP cert, PZH device cert)

</div>
Few comments from Andrea:
* user OpenID credentials, or OpenID credentials might be a little misleading, since could mean the OpenID authentication token or the credentials to be provided to the IdP, maybe could be made a little more explicit.
* A remark, if after point 11 (Generate new device token, QR code)the PZP does not connect, for how much time the token is maintained? is it possible to exploit this for a DoS, something like SYN flood attack?

Removing a device from a personal zone
--------------------------------------

<div class="uml">
actor Alice
participant Browser
participant BadDevice
participant PZH
participant OtherPZPs
activate Browser
activate PZH
autonumber
 Login process 
Alice -> Browser : Visit PZH Login URL
Alice -> Browser : "... OpenID process .."
 Revocation 
Alice -> Browser : Click "list devices"
Browser -> PZH : Call listDevices.html
PZH -> Browser : Display list of personal zone devices
Alice -> Browser : Click on the "BadDevice" entry and click "Revoke".
Browser -> PZH : Call revokeDevice( "BadDevice" )
PZH -> PZH : Policy check (NOT IMPLEMENTED)
PZH -> PZH : Find BadDevice’s certificate
PZH -> PZH : Update CRL to include BadDevice’s certificate serial number
PZH -> PZH : Save CRL to synchronised storage area
PZH -> PZH : Disconnect BadDevice if currently connected
PZH -> PZH : Restart TLS stack
PZH -> Browser : Show "done"
deactivate Browser
 Synchronisation 
activate OtherPZPs
OtherPZPs -> PZH : Connect to PZH
OtherPZPs -> PZH : Synchronisation initiated
PZH -> OtherPZPs : Send Updated CRL
OtherPZPs -> OtherPZPs : Store CRL, restart any TLS connections
deactivate OtherPZPs
 BadDevice attempts to connect to PZH 
activate BadDevice
BadDevice -> PZH : TLS connection request
PZH -> BadDevice : Refused - certificate revoked

</div>
This does not cover what happens to devices which rarely connect to the hub. We need a misuse case or attack, as well as either a mitigation, or an explanation for why we’re not doing it. We could make CRL stapling for devices mandatory if they have not connected in a while… likelihood is that nothing will be fool-proof against a motivated attacker.

Few comments from Polito:
* Minor: about revocation part, if I’m not wrong in the present implementation refers not to device but to PZP. Even if we can assume are the same entity in webinos money, I’m wondering if is worth to use PZP instead of device in the diagram
* A request of clarification: what’s the purpose in revocation part of "restart TLS stack", why is separate from the "restart any TLS connection" in synch part?
