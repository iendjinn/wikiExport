Discovery API
-------------

### Overview of API

http://dev.webinos.org/specifications/new/servicediscovery.html

"The Webinos Discovery API provide web applications with an API to discover services without any previous knowledge of the service. The Discovery API is not limited to discovery of local services but also enables discovery of remote services."

### Threats

#### API-Specific threats and misuse cases

1.  Privacy loss â€“ any application can read out which type of services that are available in the personal zone or on local networks. The service description contains information such as service type, name and a description. This information could contain the model name of your home TV, which type of personal phone you have in your zone. This information can be used by applications for fingerprinting. Potential candidates are targeted advertising, targeted theft or burglary. If an application is authorized access to a service availability could be used to monitor availability of different services. This can be used to estimate what an end user is doing and potential whether the end user is at home or not.
2.  Denial of Service â€“ any application that is accidently authorized access to a service in the personal, could use this for DoS attacks and service Hijacking.
3.  Masquerade service access â€“ when finding a services the application can fake which services that are found and give the end user the impression that service x is selected whilst service y is choosen by the application.

#### Threats based on remote invocation of this API from another device

The discovery API is an enabler for doing remote invocation but the API as such should not be possible to invoke remotely.

#### Implementation threats and possible attacks

1.  Currently there are no limitations in number of discovery operations that can be invoked in parallel. This could be misused, resulting in denial of service or exploiting a bug in an underlying service platform.

#### Threats to apps and developers using this API (E.g. Jimmy and Jessica)

1.  Unreliable application behaviour. If the discovery API produces unreliable results then the application will appear unreliable and may be unpopular with users.
2.  Discovery of privacy-invasive or insecure services. Application developers might be blamed for their applications making use of services which are invasive of their privacy or security. The discovery API has no way of presenting this information to the application.
3.  Inappropriate use of an application-defined service. If Jimmy develops a service designed to take, for example, public data about sports results with very few security implications he may get in trouble if it is misused by users for private data.

#### Threats to device manufacturers, operators, other stakeholders

1.  The API defines that service availability shall be reported as events. This could generate a lot of traffic of there a lot of services running in parallel and could potentially be devastating for the power consumption and load the network with traffic.

#### Further considerations

### Mitigations

1.  The API shall only be available for authorized applications or applications trusted by the end user.
2.  Provide feedback when services are discovered and which services that are discovered.
3.  There shall be means for end user to easily revoke access to the discovery API

### Recommended default policy rules for applications

  ------------- ------------------------------------------------------
  _.Code   _.Type
  B-A           Browser-based, authenticated via TLS certificates
  W-R           Widget, authenticated using a recognised certificate
  W-U           Widget, unrecognised

  _.B-A   _.W-R   _.W-U   _.Policy                       _.Explanation (Widgets)                                                                                                                             _.Explanation (Browser Apps)                                                                                                X      Silently allow                        2. Applications will be granted access to this API without user consent being required. This can only be modified using a policy editor.
                                         Default allow (install time)        Widgets will need user consent at install time, but users will expect to allow it (the tick-box will automatically be filled in).                        Web pages will prompt for consent (Yes / No / Always) at runtime, this preference will be saved.
  X                         X            Default ask at runtime (one-shot)   Widgets will require one-off user consent at runtime. This fact will be visible & modifiable at install time.                                            Web pages will prompt for consent (Yes / No / Always) at runtime, this preference will be saved.                                        Default ask at runtime (every time)   Widgets will require user consent at runtime, every time. This fact will be visible & modifiable at install time.
                                         Default deny (install time)         Widgets will require user consent at install time, but users will expect NOT to allow it (the tick-box will automatically be empty).                     Web pages will display a short notification at first-use saying that access was denied, with a button to change settings
                                         Silently deny                       2. Applications will not be granted access to this API, and users will not be asked at install time. This can only be modified using a policy editor.
