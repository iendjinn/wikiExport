title : Scenario 3nGeorge wants to listen to Paul’s MP4s on his mobilenmobile to mobile, and both have access to the internet

actor George
participant "George’s mobile" as George_mobile
participant "Paul’s mobile" as Paul_mobile
actor Paul

autonumber

 identification 

group identification example
 George -> George_mobile : switch on
 George_mobile -> George : ask the pin
 George -> George_mobile : provide the pin
end

 device discovery 

group device discovery example
 note over George, George_mobile : the user may set a policy to automaticallynstart device discovery
 George --> George_mobile : <font color="gray"><i>start device discovery</i></font>
 George_mobile -> Paul_mobile : broadcast hello message
 note over Paul_mobile, Paul : For privacy reasons Paul MAY explicitlynturn on visibility of his mobile for thendiscovery process
 Paul_mobile -> George_mobile: hello response
end

 personal local cloud join 

George_mobile -> George : show available cloudsnand devices
George -> George_mobile : select Paul’s mobile
George_mobile -> Paul_mobile : George’s mobile tries to authenticate
note over George_mobile, Paul_mobile : authentication fails because George’s mobilendoesn’t know Paul’s personal cloud secret
Paul_mobile -> George_mobile : authentication failed

George_mobile -> Paul_mobile: ask for join permission
Paul_mobile -> Paul : ask for join permission
Paul -> Paul_mobile: grant join permission

group session key exchange example
 Paul_mobile -> Paul : generate a session key
 note over George_mobile, Paul_mobile : How to communicate the session key?n- out-of-bandn- by a clear, local channel (e.g. by bluetooth)n- by an encrypted channel created without a trusted third partyn (e.g. a device can send his public key to the other one)n- by an encrypted channel created relying on a trusted third party (e.g. WAP)
 Paul -> George : communicate the session key out-of-band
 George -> George_mobile : insert session key
end

note over George_mobile, Paul_mobile : devices can use the session keynto establish a secure channel
George_mobile -> Paul_mobile : establish a secure channel

 service provision 

George -> George_mobile : ask for MP4 list
George_mobile -> Paul_mobile : MP4 list retrival
Paul_mobile -> Paul : ask for MP4 listnsharing permission
note over Paul, Paul_mobile : the permission is temporary because thenapp user is a personal local cloud guest
Paul -> Paul_mobile : grant temporary permission
Paul_mobile -> George_mobile : MP4 list transmission
George_mobile -> George : MP4 list display

George -> George_mobile : MP4 selection
George_mobile -> Paul_mobile : MP4 retrieval
Paul_mobile -> Paul : ask for MP4 sharing permission
note over Paul, Paul_mobile : the permission is temporary because thenapp user is a personal local cloud guest
Paul -> Paul_mobile : grant temporary permission
Paul_mobile -> George_mobile : MP4 transmission
George_mobile -> George : MP4 consumption

George -> George_mobile : select another MP4
George_mobile -> Paul_mobile : MP4 retrieval
Paul_mobile -> George_mobile : MP4 transmission
George_mobile -> George : MP4 consumption

How to communicate the session key?

a) out of band
 a.1. Paul reads the session key form his device
 a.2. Paul tells the session key to George
 a.3. George insert the session key in his device

b) by a clear, local channel
 b.1. Paul’s device establish a local connection to George’s device (e.g. by bluetooth)
 b.2. Paul’s device sends the session key to George’s device
 b.3. George’s device sends and acknowledge to Paul’s device
 b.4. Paul’s device closes the connection

c) by an encrypted channel created without a trusted third party (e.g. a device can send his public key to the other)
 c.1. Paul’s device establish a local connection to George’s device (e.g. by bluetooth)
 c.2. George’s device sends his public key to Paul’s device
 c.2. Paul’s device encrypt the session key using George’s public key
 c.3. Paul’s device sends the encrypted session key to George’s device
 c.4. George’s device decrypt the session key
 c.5. George’s device sends and acknowledge to Paul’s device
 c.6. Paul’s device closes the connection

d) by an encrypted channel created relying on a trusted third party (TTP) (e.g. WAP)
 d.1. Paul’s device establish a secure channel with the TTP (using the TTP public key)
 d.2. Paul’s device communicates to TTP the will to securely connect with George’s device
 d.3. George’s device establish a secure channel with the TTP (using the TTP public key)
 d.4. George’s device communicates to TTP the will to securely connect with Paul’s device
 d.5. TTP generates a secret key SK and communicates it to both devices
 d.6. Paul’s device close the TTP connection
 d.7. George’s device close the TTP connection
 d.8. Paul’s device and George’s device establish a secure channel using SK
 d.9. Paul’s device sends to George’s device the session key
 d.10. George’s device sends and acknowledge to Paul’s device
 d.11. Paul’s device closes the connection

Assumptions
 - the TTP can give his certificate to devices, which verify it relying on a PKI
 - alternatively, devices can trust the TTP certificate inserted by the manufacturer, by the distributor or by the dealer
