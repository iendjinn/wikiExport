Application Data APIs Minutes
=============================

Group 3: â€œApplication Data APIsâ€œ and â€žUser and installed application data APIsâ€œ
Includes: Contacts API, Calendar API, Messaging API, Gallery API, Payment API, User Profile API, et

Participants: Christian Fuhrhop, Ronny Graefe, George Gionis, Ayse Goker, Grzeegorz Szerlomski

Contacts API

Contacts API will be based on W3C contacts API. However, we will need an additional call to retrieve a serviceObject from another device/user/application instead of just allowing a local one.
Suggestion:
caller void getContactsList (ContactsListGetCB successCB, optional ContactsListGetErrorCB? errorCB, optional ContactsListGetID? contactsListID);
};
The ID needs to be retrieved by a previous call to the discovery API.
_
Note: This session was in parallel to the service discovery session, so the ‘getContactsList’ function was seen as a stand-in for whatever the search function would look like. Given the results of the discovery session, this would be most likely something like a call to webinos.findServices(user, service type, options, filters, interface) and then returning a ContactsList. The same applies to calendars, messaging, gallery_

Calendar API

Basically same for calendar API
Suggestion:
caller void getCalendarsList (CalendarsListGetCB successCB, optional CalendarsListGetErrorCB? errorCB, optional CalendarsListGetID? calendarsListID);
};

MessagingAPI

Since W3C currently allows only the sending of messages but defines (as yet) no method of
receiving or accessing messages, we need to go with the BONDI/WAC specification for this API.

As for the contacts and calendar APIs, we need to provide some function to access the messaging function on other devices, so instead of just accessing the DeviceapisMessaging interface, we need some method to provide a list of messaging objects.

GalleryAPI

For the gallery API, the W3C gallery is sufficient for webinos needs. As with the contacts, calendar and messaging API, we need some way to access remote galleries as well, so we need some method to retrieve a list of galleries, based on some discovery function here as well.

PaymentAPI

We will have a payment API and base it on the GSMA REST interface. As a first approach, we will try to map the GSMA REST interface directly to JavaScript function calls, unless we find a good reason to simplify (e.g. using just a â€œmake a payment transactionâ€ call instead of the (implied by the GSMA interface) â€œfill the shopping basket with items individiually and then go to checkoutâ€ concept). At the moment we didnâ€™t find any good reason for providing a simplified interface, since the GSMA steps seem straightforward and simple enough:
- Charge a user
- Refund a user
- Reserve an amount to charge
- Reserve an additional amount (i.e. extend an existing reservation)
- Charge against the reservation
- Release the reservation

User Profile API

Suggestion: Provide a set of profile data for the personas and make them available in whatever developer system webinos provides, so developer has a set of profiles to work and experiment with and which are mentally connected to the available descriptions, so developers donâ€™t have to use generic John Smith, Jane Smith, or test, A B, C D names, but develop their applications with (semi-) realistic users in mind.
Personal description in User Profile should be based on the W3C contact format but may include (to be studied by George Gionis) extensions to handle relationship information (similar to the one suggested by portable contacts) by providing some relationship description and a reference to a user profile the relationship applies to.

Open issues (to be worked on by George G and Ronny) are:

-   Whether something similar might also be used for â€˜relationâ€™ to devices in the user profile (e.g. â€œuser owns a web TVâ€, â€œusers primary phone is his Nexusâ€)
-   Whether the generic â€˜getProperites/setPropertiesâ€™ makes user profile properties available to all other applications, only the writing application or whether there is some method to set a granularity to that,.
-   Whether we will have a list of predefined properties or relationships or whether this will be open to the application.
    -   Pros for undefined list: Open to market developments, applications can choose their own vocabulary.
    -   Pros for pre-defined list: Only then security relevant properties can be controlled (some properties are more sensitive than others), itâ€™s easier to suggest filters to users if properties can be categorized (as opposed to list all of them without further information), applications can re-use properties set by the user via other applications (e.g. if there is a defined property â€œcolourblindâ€, it can be used across applications, if it is left to the applications itself, it might be â€œcolourblindâ€, â€œcolorblindâ€, â€œredgreenblindâ€, â€œtrichromacyâ€ or something else, with true/false value or numeric value - similar things might apply to more common user profile information such
        as â€˜preferred languageâ€™)

Installed application data API

Installed application data - currently there is no clear reason for having an API allowing direct access to data about other installed applications. For the use cases it is sufficient to provide a way of discovering applications based on search criteria (or â€˜intentâ€™) and then instantiate/run those applications based on a returned application identifier. Direct listing of other applications does not provide significant additional value but opens up security and privacy problems.
