Conceptual Architecture
-----------------------

The webinos context framework provides access to contextualized data in order to enable the design and operation of context-driven webinos applications/services.

The framework is responsible for collecting and storing context data (through the identification of specific context related events that happen within webinos enabled devices) and providing applications with a layer to access such data either by querying against the storage or by being notified in real time for context changes (when specific events happen).

In addition, the context framework is closely coupled with the webinos policy and privacy enforcement framework in order to ensure secure handling of the often highly sensitive context data that is stored.

The following schema describes the conceptual architecture of the Webinos Context Framework and illustrates its connection to the Policy/Privacy enforcement framework through the Policy Enforcement Point.

Technical Use Cases
-------------------

George is a webinos user that has several webinos enabled devices, a mobile, a desktop and a set top box.

The following short use cases describes the context data acquisition process from context related events, Querying for Context Data using the Context Query API and Subscribing to receive context data updates using the Context Changes Subscription API.

### Use Case1: Acquisition of Context Data from Context Related Events

George is updating his webinos profile by adding to it one of his social network profiles (i.e. facebook). This activity constitutes a context related event and triggers a context acquisition process at the device. This means that (meta)data about Georgeâ€™s newly added social profile will be added to his context data, provided that George has allowed for such context data acquisition in his privacy settings.

<div class="uml">
actor George
autonumber

George -> George_Device:Update Webinos Profile with Social Profile
George_Device->Personal_Zone_Proxy:Request Extracting Eventâ€™s context data

alt extracting the eventâ€™s context data has NOT BEEN authorized by the user
Personal_Zone_Proxy-> George_Device:Reject (terminate process)

else extracting the eventâ€™s context data has BEEN authorized by the user
Personal_Zone_Proxy-> George_Device:Accept (Proceed)
George_Device -> Personal_Zone_Proxy:Extracted Context Data
Personal_Zone_Proxy -> Personal_Zone_Hub:Synchronize Eventâ€™s Context Data in Storage

end

</div>
### Use Case2: Query for Context Data

George is at a coffee shop with a couple of his friends John and Jos. George has bought (and downloaded in his mobile) a new single of one of his favorite artist and wants to stream it to his friends devices. For that he is using an app in his mobile that allows him to stream mp3s to other (capable for playback devices). He is accessing his app, selects his new mp3 and invokes device discovery using a social proximity filter. The app, using the webinos discovery APIs, discovers several devices around George capable of receiving streaming. In order to prioritize the discovered devices (i.e. put at the top the ones George is most likely to want to stream music to) the app uses the Context API to Query for context data that illustrate if Georgeâ€™s device has connected with any of the discovered devices in the past or if George has any social connection with the discovered device owners.

<div class="uml">
actor George
autonumber

George->App:Discover Devices in Social Proximity
App -> Personal_Zone_Proxy:Query for Context Data

alt the Appâ€™s Query for context data has NOT BEEN authorized by the user
Personal_Zone_Proxy-> App:Reject (Terminate Query)

else the Appâ€™s Query for context data has BEEN authorized by the user
Personal_Zone_Proxy-> Personal_Zone_Hub:Query the Context Storage
Personal_Zone_Hub -> App:Query Results

end

</div>
### Use Case3: Subscribe to Context Changes Updates

George has a recommendations app on his mobile TV that he has set up to provide him real-time recommendations for alternative broadcasts whenever he is watching an adventure film during primetime (21:00-00:00). The app is using the Context Change Subscription API to get notifications in real-time whenever the user sets on his TV a channel airing an adventure film between the hours 21:00 and 00:00.

<div class="uml">
actor George
autonumber

George->App:Set Parameters for Recommendations
App -> Personal_Zone_Proxy:Context Change Subscription

alt context data acquisition (for the context event the subscription refers to) has NOT BEEN authorized by the user
Personal_Zone_Proxy-> App:Reject (cancel subscription)

else context data acquisition (for the context event the subscription refers to) has BEEN authorized by the user
Personal_Zone_Proxy-> App:Accept (subscription made)
Personal_Zone_Proxy -> Personal_Zone_Hub:Register Subscription for Context Changes

end

</div>
Formal Specification
--------------------

### 1. Context Framework

The scope of providing context-awareness within webinos is three-fold:

1.  To identify context related events and register (occurring) context data
2.  To enable context-aware behaviour for any webinos application by enabling secure access to context data regulated by user- policies
3.  To be able to transform various multi-media formats for web content based on context data (content adaptations)

Therefore the extent of the context framework in webinos is to define and implement the most suitable mechanisms (in terms of context data acquisition, representation, storage and access) in the webinos context model in such a way that a range of any webinos applications literally can start exhibiting context-awareness support enabled by the webinos platform and runtime in a secure way.

The following sub-sections summarise key characteristics of the webinos context framework.

**Support for creating context aware applications by enabling access to context data**

Context-awareness support in webinos will allow applications to access context data that can enable such a behavior, in particular:

-   Listen for context related events happening on device level, either by user activities (at device level) or by applications using the underlying APIs.
-   Subscribe to events across applications and devices that bring about changes in context data.
-   Retrieve stored context data of identified/subscribed, context-related, events.
-   Retrieve stored context data about the current device or a target device where an application is to be executed.
-   Retrieve stored context data about a specific user (i.e. device owner) or a particular application (i.e. an app receiving a message on a device).
-   Retrieve real-time updates of context data from context related events they have subscribed to.
-   Perform reasoning based on the underlying context data, for example evaluate the social proximity of discovered devices based on social connections of their owners or previous activity (i.e. sharing a device feature).

**Providing for the Secure and Privacy-aware access to context information through user-negotiated policies**

Context-awareness support will be secured by dedicated access control functions provided by a policy manager entity (the â€œpolicy enforcement pointâ€). This entity constitutes a global access point that provides for secure and authorized access to context information, specifically:

-   Allow only the permitted applications to access context information about the user, the device, the application, etc.
-   Inform the user about context and personal information that is registered, accessed and shared by applications. This is with the exception of context information that is private for the application itself.
-   Provide access control to context structures through user-defined policies.
-   Implement the privacy policies that the user and the application negotiate between them.
-   Securely store associations between device, user and context information and provide this information based on user preferences.
-   Register their intent to access context information provided by the underlying webinos platform, given that the user permits the access to this context information originating from the webinos platform.
-   Ensure that the user is offered the possibility to understand and control the access to context information originating from the underlying webinos system for all applications that registers an intent.
-   Ensure the security and integrity of any context information that is privately created and stored by the application, so that attackers and users can not tamper with the stored or shared context information.

**Transform various multi-media formats for web content and Context-driven adaptation support**

Devices in general do not support all available file formats for transcoding various multi-media formats. The result is that some files cannot be viewed in some devices, but should the content is presented on another device it would render fine. Context information can be used to identify what file types and codec support a device provides. After obtaining this information, an application may sometimes need to transform/ transcode the content into a new file or media stream. The following support will be provided by the webinos platform to application as part of its context-awareness functions:

-   Check device compatibility with certain file formats.
-   Provide embedded mechanisms that transform file formats.
-   Support the integration of external content adaptation services.
-   Use device context and user context as means to adapt the delivery and presentation of content.
-   Use context information for pushed content to trigger the installation of the correct application in case the application is not yet installed on the device that is receiving the pushed content.

In order to address the needs of a multi-device and cross-platform applications, Webinos platform defines formalized way of describing content and layout of the page to be able to provide an integration layer that allows to integrate external adaptation services into the platform. The following will be provided by the platform to support variety of existing and future adaptation services:
* Extensible integration layer that allows for third party adaptation services integration.
* Support for input transformation filters that can transform content as per the required format for third party adaptation service.
* Support for output transformation filters that can transform third party adaptation services output to format required by the platform.
* Support for organizing filters into filter chains performing set of transformations over content.

Adaptation service input consists of:
* Device Context information reflecting actual state of the device
* Device user-agent string identifying the device/browser details.
* Content to transform pre-processed by filtering mechanism to fulfill adaptation service requirements.

Adaptation service output consists of:
* Transformed content that can be post-processed to meet requirements of Webinos platform.

### 1.1 A context model for webinos

A model in general can be described as a systematic description of an object or phenomenon that shares important characteristics with the object or phenomenon. It can be seen as a representation of relevant/ important aspects of the target object or phenomenon that is being described.
Context describes aspects of a situation seen from an actor/ entity’s point of view. From such a viewpoint, context acquisition in webinos becomes the process of sensing and gathering context information to help enhance the quality and usefulness of the application. A context model represents (or guides) how these (retrieved) data are structured together in a way that makes sense. The approach in webinos, is to define a very methodical way of handling context information. We believe this will be important for application developers to be able to add context-awareness to their application to benefit from it. In this section, we present the foundations for representing context information in webinos applications. It is based on a review of existing literature in the field, including some EU-projects that have been working with context-aware applications and services as well as the webinos partners existing experience in the field.

**Relating context to how humans sense, think, and act**

Our human mind is episodic in nature. We remember artefacts, objects, people, and information easier if we are able to remember/ recall aspects of the situation in which we experienced the entities in. Not only do we organise our thoughts and remember in an eposidic way, also our human communication is full of associations and references to past, present, future and imaginative/dreamt situations. Our cogntion helps us to perceive, remember, recall, reason, and act. In neuro-science and psychology one distinctinguishes between episodic and semantic memory - see for instance Tulving (1972). Consider how we reflect upon printed magazines in a book section; We might remember them according to the front cover, an article, some photo we saw inside it, the title of an article, a person in a picture, or the place we read the magazine. Some of these â€˜triggersâ€™ can be difficult to capture, and record.
Context-aware systems are to some extent trying to mimic this kind of cognitive behaviour based on sensing, thinking, and acting in the situation. If a living organism is acting well within a situation, then one would typically say that the organism is adapting well to that situation. The notion of adaptivity is therefore related to context-aware systems. Remembering context in a software program is therefore about creating a facility that stores the episodic information captured in the situation.

**Definition of context**

There are many definitions of context. This is due to research in the topic within computer science, information science, and artificial intelligence.
Context is much related to the notion of a situation. In some languages the words ‘situation’ and ‘context’ are being used to describe each other. For instance, "it is not the right situation for this yet" could easily be rephrased to "at the moment the context is not right for this" and mean almost the same. For our work, we will use the following definitions: Situations exist in the real world. There are actors/ entities involved in situations. A situation endures over a period of time. This is true whether the time is referred to as a point in time, an hour, a day, at night, in the summer, and so on. We define context as a description of the aspects of a situation.
In this way, a context captures important aspects of a situation when a context related event occurs. This means that someone has decided which particular aspects that are more important/ matters more than others and through which events these aspects can be captured. Context therefore is an explicit representation of a situation. Capturing context information can therefore be compared with taking a snapshot of a situation when a corresponding event happers, where only the most important things are being developed into the preserved "photo" (ref context).

The following figure depicts the relations between Situations, Context data, Events and webinos Entities. An entity may be any person, thing, or system that is being active or passive for that situation.

<div class="uml">

Entity "involves **" — "is within**" Situation
Situation "describes aspects of a" — "is represented by **" Context
Situation "is related to**" — "is identified by *" Event

</div>
**Which entity is the context for?**

In literature and in technical implementations there are many different types of contexts mentioned. In general, it can be observed that context means something different for the researchers and the application developers. The naming of the context depends quite much on the entity or actor the context is intended for. When sharing, debating, and reasoning about context, because of its dependency on time, people often discuss how context changes over time. This means that in webinos the naming of contexts will reflect the actor/entity that is involved in the situation as the subject:

-   Contexts that describes aspects of a user’s situations are referred to as user contexts.
-   Contexts that describes aspects of an application’s situations are referred to as application contexts.
-   Contexts that describes aspects of a device’s situations are referred to as device contexts.
-   Contexts that describes aspects of a user’s social situations are referred to as social contexts. A social context is for this reason considered to be sub-part of a user context.

In webinos, these four kinds of contexts have been referred to in the user stories, use cases, and requirements. In terms of inheritance diagram, these four identified types of contexts can be depicted in UML as:

<div class="uml">

Context <|— UserContext
Context <|— ApplicationContext
Context <|— DeviceContext
Context <|— SocialContext

</div>
Please note that a social context is part of a user context, but that we have not depicted this in this inheritance diagram. We will come back to this composition relation (i.e. a part-of relation) in another UML diagram below.

### 1.2 Context representation in webinos

**Adressing the needs of each application and the platform**

Since the purpose is to enable any application to be context-aware, there will be a wide variety of needs for representing context information in webinos. Some of these needs will be individual for each application. The context-awareness support therefore would need to cater for all these demands as means to be sufficiently generic.

This is because context information that is relevant for one application will most likely not be relevant for another application. Secondly, context information that is individually captured, created and maintained by one application will need data integrity, and should/cannot not be taken out of context nor modified by another application.

The exception to this is when the context information originates from the webinos platform itself - for instance from a location sensor. In such cases, since context information is generated by the underlying platform, and it can be personally sensitive, applications will need to negotiate their consent with the user to access this kind of context information. Yet when they are authorized (by the User) to access and use such context data these should be readily available to them through the platform mechanisms. The latter is one of the basic objectives of the webinos context framework.

**Structured vs. unstructured context information**

Having analysed multiple system approaches to modelling and representing context, we have identified two main approaches for the representation of context:

1.  Structured context information
2.  Unstructured context information

Unstructured context information can be thought of as a collection of attributes or properties that have not been classified or categorised in a data structure. For example the phrases "in the city, tomorrow, meeting, Helen, Alice" is considered unstructured context information. Text queries to a web search engine can be viewed as unstructured context information. This approach is very suitable when it is difficult to define a context structure due to the absence of data structures.

On the other hand, a structured approach to representing context information reflects a view that it is desirable to have some consistency and stability in the representation, categorisation, and expression of attributes and relations. Context information have been represented as tree structures, property lists, arrays, semantic networks, graphs and so on. These context structures can either be static or dynamic. A light weight way of representing structured context information is the use of a list of property-value pairs. With property-value pairs, we mean the same as attribute-value pairs.

Here are two examples of such a light weight representations of context information:

1.  "color=pink, interior=light-beige, buyer=Peter, car=BMW".
2.  "location=home, orientation=vertical, device=Experia Neo, time=yesterday".

In webinos, we have chosen to represent context as a hierarchical tree-based representations of situations. The first reason for this is that tree-structures can be mathematically proven to be a list of elements. The second rationale is that unstructured information can always be represented in a structure. With this is we gain the possibility to categorise and sub-categorise the context information where unstructured information is just categorised in one category. This gives the developer community the opportunity to better organise and group context information together, and to also handle unstructured context information if needed.

**The context strucure in webinos**

The class diagram below shows core of all webinos context structures. A context has attributes with values. One can also add relations with other entities. A context has:

-   Name
-   Privacy
-   Attributes

A context can consist of sub-contexts to better group attributes together, although this would not be needed if there are few context attributes. The below class diagram for context information can described with: context can consist of several sub-contexts, and a context can be part of another context. A context will always comprise one or more attributes.

<div class="uml">

Context o— "*" Context : can be part of
Context *— "*" Attribute
Context "*" — "*" Entity : can be related to
Attribute o— ValueRange
Attribute o— ValueSet

class Context {
+ Name: String
+ Privacy: int
}

class Attribute {
+ Name: String
+ Value: DataPrimitive
}

</div>
Each context attribute has a name and a value. The type of the context attribute is a data primitive (e.g. Boolean, integer, float, double, or string). In many cases it will be sufficient to just use string as the data type for a context attribute.

However, it is not always needed to have attributes at the top-levels of the context if the top-level context consists of several sub-contexts. In this case, the attributes of the sub-contexts qualify the top-level context to be a context in its own right. This approach to organise contexts information allows for making meaningful contexts without including attributes at the top-level context - as long as there are attributes at the bottom level contexts in the structure.

The benefit of this, is that chunks of context attributes can be copied from one context instance to another. For example, if a device context contains a location attribute, one can copy this entire attribute for in the user context structure. This makes the reuse of context information across context instances effective.

**Attributes can have value sets and ranges**

In some cases it is desirable to constrain the possible values for specific attributes. It is desirable on these cases to achieve this through the use of finite value sets or ranges. For instnace, an attribute with name="Capitol", type=string, could be constrained to the values = {"London", "Edinburgh", "Berlin", "Rome", "Madrid", "Istanbul", "Paris", "Athens", "Warsaw"}.

Here are some examples of value ranges:
* [10, 1000], (integer)
* [0.1, 0.12>, (float)
* <-1.0, 1.0>, (complex)
* [false, true], (Boolean)
* [June 1 2010, Aug 31 2010], (date)
* [**], (integer)

Here are some examples of value sets:
** {"Cyan", "Magenta", "Yellow"}, (string)
* {"None", "Little", "Medium", "High"}, (string)
* {"A2", "A3", "A4", "A5"}, (string)
* {10, 15, 20, 25}, (integer)
* {false, true}, (Boolean)
* {Jun 1 2012, Feb 1 2012}, (date)
* {*}, (string)

The data primitive of the value (i.e. type) are indicated in brackets.

h3. 1.3 User context in webinos

The following user context model describes aspects of a situation seen from the user’s point of view (Myrhaug and Goker, 2003). This is proposed as a framework for exploiting user contexts within and across application domains. We believe this to be a comprehensive model that can be used with a wide range of applications involving user contexts. The structure is designed to enable effective matching and retrieval of contexts. The user context structure consists of five sub-contexts:

* Environment context
* Personal context
* Task context
* Social context
* Spatio-temporal context

Each sub-context should be considered as a container where an application developer can insert the important context attributes with values and types needed in the particular context-aware application, see the UML class diagram below that shows the various parts of the user context model:

<div class=“uml”>(

User "1" — "*" UserContext : is related to
UserContext o— SocialContext
UserContext o— TaskContext
UserContext o— PersonalContext
UserContext o— EnvironmentContext
UserContext o— SpatioTemporalContext

class PersonalContext {
+ MentalContext
+ PhysiologicalContext
}

</div>

**Environment context**

This part of the user context captures the entities that surround the user. These entities may be (but are not limited to) things, services, temperature, light, humidity, noise, and persons. Information (e.g. text, images, movies, sounds) that is accessed by the user can be linked to the environment context. The various networks that are in the surrounding area can also be described in the userâ€™s environment context.

**Personal context**

This part of the user context consists of two sub contexts: the physiological context and the mental context. The physiological context contains information such as pulse, blood pressure, weight, glucose level, retinal pattern, and hair colour. The mental context contains information like mood, interests, expertise, angriness, stress, etc.

**Task context**

This context describes what people are doing. The task context can be described with explicit goals, tasks, actions, activities, or events. Note that this can also include other personsâ€™ tasks that are within the situation. For example, considering a car with a driver and passengers, the situation can include the driver driving the car, passengers doing various activities such as reading, watching the car TV, and listening to music on the personal stereo. The task context of the driver and the passengers will be different.

**Social context**

This context describes the social aspects of the current user context. It can contain information about friends, neighbours, co-workers, relatives, and their presence. One important aspect in a social context is the role that the user plays in the context. A role can for instance be described with a name, the userâ€™s status in this role, and connections to the tasks in the task context. A role can, in addition, be played in a social arena. A social arena can have a name like â€œat workâ€.

**Spatio-temporal context**

This context aspect describes aspects of the user context relating to the time and spatial location for the user context. It may contain attributes for time, location, direction, speed, shape (of objects/buildings/terrain), track, place, clothes of the user and so on (i.e. the physical extension of the environment and the things in it) .

**Validation of the user context model**

Below, we relate othersâ€™ work on context models within the model above.

Environment context captures the entities around the user. It includes objects of the surrounding environment (e.g. buildings, outdoor facilities, infrastructure) and their state (i.e. temperature, light, humidity, noise). It also describes information â€“ what Lucas (2001) calls information context â€“ as part of the environment. Furthermore, devices that reside in the usersâ€™ vicinity are also accounted for as part of the environment. Attributes of these devices define the extent with which personalisation can be performed (Chalmers and Sloman, 1999). Examples include the processing power, screen size/resolution, colour support, sound capabilities and the kind and number of input devices. Similar to Goker and Myrhaug, (2002), Schmidt, Biegl, and Gellersen (1999) also categorises contextual information about device(s) as part of the physical environment.

Personal context is equal to the user information that is stored in a typical user model (as also discussed later in following section). It can be distinguished into userâ€™s physiological context (e.g. age or body weight) and userâ€™s mental context (e.g. interest). This is similarly described in Schmidt, Biegl, and Gellersen (1999), that states that â€information on the user comprises for instance knowledge of habits, mental state or physiological characteristicsâ€. Attributes that are represented by the mental context can generally be found in user models. Examples include userâ€™s identity, preferences, knowledge and skills as listed in Reichenbacherâ€™s context model (2007). Userâ€™s interest is one of the most important attributes that is commonly modelled in most user models and has been widely applied in personalised information systems (Brusilovsky, 1996).

Task context contains information about what the user is doing or aiming for. It describes â€the functional relationship of the user with other people and objectsâ€ (Bradley and Dunlop, 2004), including the benefits and constraints of this relationship. It can be modelled as explicit goals, actions and activities. Userâ€™s activity is a common type of context in a number of context models such as the one described in Reichenbacher (2007) as well as Chalmers and Sloman (1999).

Social context represents the social environment of a user. It may describe usersâ€™ relationships to like-minded people that are connected to the user. Social filtering systems implement one special kind of social context modelling (Griffith and Oâ€™Riordan, 2000). The recommendation output is solely based on a user being similar to other users who rated items previously. This social connection is then exploited to recommend more items. Social filtering systems have demonstrated good results for a range of relevant topics such as music (Shardanand and Maes, 1995) and news (Resnick et al., 1994). Social context may model a userâ€™s list of friends or colleagues â€“ perhaps explicitly expressed by that user or implicitly acquired through an email address book or buddy list on a website.

Spatio-temporal context represents physical space and time. The spatial aspect represents physical space. Location is the most common aspect of a spatial context. Mobile guides such as Cyberguide (Abowd et al., 1997), GUIDE (Cheverst et al., 2000) and the CRUMPET system (Zipf, 2002) belong to a special class of applications that are commonly referred to as location-based services. Based on its relevance, location modelling has emerged as one research branch in location-based services; a comprehensive overview is provided in Jiang and Yao (2006). Many location-based services employ location for the personalisation of geographic maps. Location can be represented either geographically or semantically as described in Beigl (2002). The geographic representation exhibits locations by its position (i.e. coordinates provided from the Global Positioning System (GPS)). On the other hand, the semantic representation describes locations in a more descriptive and humanly understandable way, yet still able to be processed by a computer. The comMotion system described in Marmasse and Schmandt (2000) for example learned meaningful locations semantically by analysing usersâ€™ GPS logs over time. Besides location, spatial context also models attributes such as the direction of movement, the viewing direction and the speed of movement.

The temporal aspect, of the spatio-temporal sub-context, refers to time and can be represented as an absolute measurement or in a more relative manner (e.g. â€™in the eveningâ€™ or â€™before a meetingâ€™). In Hull et al. (1997), time is part of the usersâ€™ environment. Similarly, Reichenbacher (2007) views it together with location as part of a situation. In Schmidt, Biegl, and Gellersen (1999), temporal context is related to all other context attributes representing the contextual change of those attributes over time. In Bradley and Dunlop (2004), temporal context is described as being â€embedded within everything, and is what gives a current situation meaning…â€.

Overall, although there is some empirical work (Bierig and Goker, 2006) that investigates more closely a context model and its attributes, there is generally a lack of empirical work for investigating the relation between various context attributes.

h3. 1.4 Device context in webinos

The following device context model describes aspects of a situation seen from the device’s point of view. This is proposed as a framework for using device contexts within and across webinos applications. As with the user context, we also believe this to be a fairly comprehensive model that can be used with a wide range of applications involving device contexts. It is anticipated that most, if not all, device context information can be sub-categorised and stored within this generic structure. The device context structure consists of five sub-contexts:

<div class=“uml”>(

DeviceContext o— SensorContext
DeviceContext o— DisplayContext
DeviceContext o— SoundContext
DeviceContext o— SystemContext
DeviceContext o— NetworkContext

</div>

**Sensor Context**

A sensor context contains context attributes where the values of the context attributes originates from sensors connected to the device. It describes the sensor aspects of the device. It can contain information originating from any sensor on the device. Some examples of sensors may result in the storage of context data are: light, camera, motion, location, touch, temperature, biometric, microphone, keyboard, mouse, and near-field communication. One important aspect for the sensor context it therefore to be able to make sensors update contexts.


**Display Context**

The display context describes aspects of the display(s) connected to the device. The context information may be (but are not limited to) describing the screen, the type, the identifier, the resolution, the color depth and format, if it is a 3D enabled display, its standby state, the application being displayed, its luominosity and so on. One could also store attributes data about a as well as the shape of the display shape, text and line drawing capabilities.

**Sound Context**

A sound context is meant for capturing and storing context information about the sound context of the device. This can include information about the available loud speakers, the headset, the system volume, the supported sound qualities such as mono, stereo, surround, and environmental sound. It could be if the sound is muted, what the balance between the loud speakers is set to, the various acoustic levels in the surroundings, whether there is a microphone available or not, the type of microphone connected, the sound card that is installed and so on.

**System Context**

This part of the device context captures the local system capabilities of the device. The context information categorised within this can be (but not limited to) processor, work load, identifier, name, model, operating system, webinos runtime. Power consumption, battery, battery status, hardware devices, multi-media codecs available, mime types supported, the supported HTML version, the supported CSS version, available applications, available displays, available braille devices, printers, USB disks, hard drives, flash drives, database drivers, filesystem, cloud system folders and so on.


**Network Context**

A network context describes aspects of the various networks that the device either currently is conntected to- or the network bearer capabilities assumed available on the local device. For applications using network context, one could for instance foresee the likelihood of capturing various network topologies, the bandwidth of a network, measures of physical distance between network nodes, measures of latency between network nodes, degrees of trust for network nodes etc. Furthermode, the various attributes could be described for WLAN, Bluetooth, USB, GSM, Ethernet, Firewire, children. Nearby/ connected devices could be added to the network context, such as mobile phones, printers, displays, payment terminals, laptops, car infotainment system and so on. This, a network context is related to Quality of Service (QoS) aspects of the network and node connectivity.

### 1.5 Application context in webinos

The following application context model describes aspects of a situation seen from the application’s point of view. This is proposed as a framework for using application contexts within and across webinos applications. As with the device context, we also believe this to be a fairly comprehensive model that can be used with a wide range of applications involving application contexts. We believe that there is a potentially large amount of context information can be sub-categorised and kept within this structure. The application context consists of the following four sub-contexts:

<div class="uml">

ApplicationContext o— ProviderContext
ApplicationContext o— ResourceContext
ApplicationContext o— RuntimeContext

</div>
**ProviderContext**

The provider category contains information that is related to the provision of applications data and content. It can be information about the provider of the application, such as the name, the authority, the access period, if the application is enabled, and so on. It can also contain information about what type of content/data that the application is capable of offering to other applications including the webinos platform. This could be sound, images, contacts, business cards etc. For instance, if two applications on the same device would like to provide contacts, because the user is creating contacts within each application, there is the issue of negotiating permission with the runtime to be able share this with other applications in a standardised way. Secondly, if an application would like to make some of its data public, one could alternatively specify new attributes and make them public.

**ResourceContext**

This context describes aspects of the resources available for the application. It can contain information about the originating app store, raw data, layouts, menus, preferences, settings, storages, XML files, and so on. With resources we mean the resouces available for the application, whether it is downloadable or hosted.

**RuntimeContext**

Context information relating to various runtime components could be included in this category. This could be context data about activities, widgets, activities, services, servers, etc. Furthermore, one could include information about the state of the runtime, the required runtime for an application to work, the required libraries, the minimum libraries that has to be present, the minim html version that is needed and so on.

### 2. Context API

The context API constitutes a layer that enables applications to access the underlying volume of contextual data in a uniform way. It provided two APIs that allow applications two different modes of accessing context data:
* Query API, enabling applications to perform queries for particular context data in the storage.
* Change Subscription API, enabling application to subscribe for specific events that bring about a change in context data and be notified in real time when such events happen.
The following code extracts are an exemplary of the two APIs which are defined in detail in 3.2 along with the rest of the webinos APIs.

<pre><code>
interface ContextManager {
 void executeQuery(in QuerySuccessCallback successCallback,

in QueryErrorCallback? errorCallback,

in Query query)

raises(ContextError);

void subscribeContextEvent(in SubscribeSuccessCallback subscribeSuccessCallback,

in SubscribeErrorCallback? subscribeErrorCallback,

in OccuringEvent eventHandler,

in DOMString eventIdentifier)

raises(ContextError);
}
</code></pre>

### 3. Context Storage

The Context Storage component deals with storing and returning contextual data. Based on the diversity of devices and operating systems which are to be supported by the webinos platform, pinpointing a specific storage technology and bringing it to all devices/platforms is nearly impossible. This is why, the component operates a connector model in order to make the storage operations independent from the underlying database and operating system. As already mentioned, the design decision is made in support of system portability and flexibility. By providing additional connector implementations, the Context Storage component can connect to various types of database technologies (e.g. relational databases, graph databases, triple stores, etc.). Connectors can be created by the third party webinos developers and should be deployable at runtime.

<pre><code>
Interface ContextStorage{

StoreConnector connect(in string connectorID);

StoreConnector connect(in string connectorID, in object properties);

object getConnectors();
};

Interface StoreConnector{

boolean execute(in string statement);

object executeQuery(in string query);

int executeUpdate(in string update);

object getStatus();

void close();
};
</code></pre>

Store connectors can be implemented for traditional relational database management systems (RDBMS) such as SQLite or MySQL. On the other hand, this approach also supports but does not enforces the use of storage mechanisms optimized for context-data persistence. Graph databases for example are a type of NoSQL database. The graph database approach differs from RDBMSs as it uses oriented graph structures to store data rather than in tables. All information is represented by means of the graph’s nodes, edges, and properties. Nodes are used to represent entities, whilst properties can be added to provide additional information regarding an entity. In turn, the edges define node-to-node and node-to-property connections and thus represent a certain relationship between the two connected items.

The pros and cons of such an approach are:
+ High flexibility by allowing nodes with dynamic properties to be linked arbitrarily to other nodes.
+ High scalability of NOSQL databases.
- Lower efficiency in batch processing compared to RDBMSs.

  ---------- --------------- ------------------------------------- ------------------------------------

Another example of database systems optimized for context storage are triple stores. As with graph databases, triple stores also rely on graph structures for storing data. In particular, triple stores provide an optimized mechanism for the persistent storage of RDF triples. Compared to graph databases, where focus are mainly the characteristics of the graph (e.g. distances, reachability, etc.), triple stores mainly aim for optimized query processing and knowledge inference. The built-in support for semantics and formal RDF inference rules provides better means to extract new triples. The main language for performing RDF queries is SPARQL (Simple Protocol and RDF Query Language). SPARQL is standardized by the W3C RDF Data Access Working Group (DAWG). It enables flexible queries consisting of triple patterns, conjunction/disjunction patterns, as well as optional patterns.

The pros and cons of a triple store approach are:
+ Both data format and query language are standardized.
+ Unlike RDBMSs, triple stores are optimized for intensive use of query and insertion operations.
- The development of triple stores is still in its inital phase. Lots of triple stores are built on top of traditinoal RDBMSs, possibly introducing performance issues.

### 4. Context Reasoning

Context reasoning is needed in order to infer new facts from instance data and class descriptions in the Context Storage. The reasoners are thus the objects that perform the task of deriving additional information. The reasoning process allows the system to derive higher-level context data, by combining lower-level knowledge originating from device sensors, or applications. The reasoning component is pluggable, supporting the addition of specialized reasoning capabilities that are optimized for a specific task and/or environment.

![](http://www.wafl.ugent.be/webinos/high-level-context.png)

First of all, there is often a need for sensor data fusion. This action aims at integrating different context sources in order to make the available knowledge more reliable. A well known example is the integration of location-aware sources. A user’s location can be obtained from various sources: GPS positioning, cell tower triangulation, IP geolocation lookup, etc. All these source have varying accuracies, ranging from a few meters to several kilometers. Especially when users own multiple devices, sensor data fusion can be used to further enhance the precision of contextual data such as location. Context reasoning is a challenging task, as there must be a mechanism in support of mapping lower-level context data to higher-level knowledge. Context reasoners in general rely on two approaches for mapping different levels of context data: the use of ontologies (e.g. OWL), and the use of probabilistic reasoning to produce probabilistic models.

<pre><code>
Interface Reasoner {

Reasoner bindOntology(in object axioms);

void run();

object getStatus();

object getInferenceResults();

void setProperty(in string key, in object value);
};
</code></pre>

A number of good RDF/OWL reasoners are already available. For example Pellet, an advanced OWL reasoner. The Jena Reasoner on the other hand provides an extensible, which allows a wide range of inference engines/reasoners to be plugged into the Jena platform.

  ---------------- --------------- ------------- -------------------------------------------

Such a reasoner approach could be easily implemented on top of the basic mechanisms of the Context Framework in webinos, i.e. the context acquisition, the access APIs and the context storage.

Dependencies on other components
--------------------------------

The webinos Context Framework presents interdependencies with practically every other area in the system. This is primarily due to the nature of context, i.e. it needs to be aware of what is â€œhappeningâ€ in the system and acquire/provide access to relevant context data.

Specifically two broad lines of interdependencies can be identified:
* Monitoring the operation of several areas (Discovery, Authentication, Messaging, Analytics, API calls, etc) in order to identify context related events, track their occurrence and acquire the necessary context data for describing the corresponding situation.
* Adopting the implemented Privacy framework in order to ensure a privacy preserving operation of the entire Context framework, meaning allowing the user to enable or disable tracking of context data, enforcing applications to inform the user about their intention to access and use his context data, empowering the user to allow or not applications to access his context data.
