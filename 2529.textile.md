Summary
-------

We have analysed the webinos architecture based on 14 attack patterns motivated by the findings of Deliverable 2.7 and 2.8, as well as ongoing development and emerging security and privacy issues. This provides a substantial range of attacks and obstacles to consider in the architecture. Indeed, all of the leaf obstacles obtained during this process have been included in the analysis and shown to either be satisfied by a goal supported by the architecture or shown to be lacking a solution at present. Our process is sufficiently rigorous that we are now able to draw several conclusions about the design of the architecture. However, more attack patterns and architectural patterns should be developed in the coming months in order to provide a more complete analysis and to prioritise future development of security functionality. It is also important to note that this analysis refers primarily to the _specification_ of the system rather than the implementation. We have not analysed the level in which the specifications are implemented, nor have we considered the strength of the implementation against known code-level vulnerabilities.

Based on the findings of the attack-resistance, weakness and ambiguity analysis, we have made the following conclusions.

### Application rendering

At present, our architecture does not fully address attacks on content rendered by widget renderers and browsers. This leaves webinos and webinos applications vulnerable to attacks such as content injection (cross site scripting, for example). This is primarily due to the re-use of existing web browsers as opposed to customising a browser with a webinos-specific extension. Customisation would allow additional rules and restrictions to prevent some of the more prevalent and likely attacks.

### Comparative exposure of personal zone hubs and proxies

Based on the quantitative analysis of the attack surface in the ambiguity analysis, the webinos attack surface associated with setting up personal zone hubs is greater than the surface exposed when enrolling devices to personal zones; this is largely due to the attack surfaces of the assets associated with each architectural pattern rather than the damage potential associated with component interfaces or connectors. While a lot of emphasis has been placed on the device-side webinos architecture, the webinos hub-side architecture is less well understood with undefined surface types for the administration console and the potential for rendering engine weaknesses compromising traffic to/from a personal zone hub.

#### Reliance on OpenID authentication

The webinos platform is novel in its approach to authentication: we introduce no new passwords or usernames into the system and delegate most authentication tasks either to the underlying operating system or to an OpenID provider. However, this puts many mitigations out of scope, and the system is at risk when a weak or insecure OpenID provider is used. We believe this to be a reasonable approach, but it also means that webinos personal zone hub providers ought to limit the number of OpenID providers they support for security reasons, despite the negative impact on interoperability.

#### Policy management remains crucial

The policy-based access control system remains an important aspect of webinos and is responsible for satisfying at least 15 goals from the ambiguity analysis. This means that additional effort should be spent making sure that policy features are implemented in the platform, and that appropriate tools and user interfaces are provided. It is also true that default policy settings will be important to mitigate several obstacles, and these may need to be improved based on experience and the findings from Deliverable 2.8.

#### Privacy and service discovery

A privacy issue that has been discovered throughout the analysis is the use of the `findService` call, which returns persistent device identifiers and could potentially be used to re-identify the user, breaking unlinkability requirements. This problem has been reported to the rest of the project, and motivates further improvements and investigations of the Web Intents alternatives, as discussed in Deliverable D3.3.

#### Protecting webinos source code

The current webinos development process must protect users against the potential for a malicious contributor from adding back-door vulnerabilities to the platform. While this is solved (to some extent) through the gate-keeping implemented as part of the GitHub development process, further improvements are needed. In particular, creating a larger distinction between tests and platform code and making it easy to remove testing code from deployments of the platform.

A related issue is that of code quality and input sanitisation. Any communication with the PZP should be thoroughly checked and validated against a provided schema to prevent malicious code injection exploiting the runtime. This should be part of the requirements for accepting new code into the webinos source code repository.

#### Denial of service issues

Several of the attack patterns we considered in this analysis relate to denial of service issues. We believe that the architecture mitigates denial of service attacks in the following way:

1.  Because the PZP does not rely on having a PZH available for local functionality, loss of the PZH doesnâ€™t prevent use of the PZPs. The PZH being made unavailable is, therefore, less important in many situations than a PZP being made unavailable. Indeed, the PZH is not required for local, peer-to-peer interaction between devices.
2.  Support for downloadable widgets means that application can be used offline, and can be designed to be resistant to loss of network connectivity. Installing applications does not require an internet connection.
3.  Process isolation between the web browser or widget renderer and the PZP should make the PZP harder to attack directly.
4.  Restrictions on widget content should make content-injection DoS attacks harder to perform.
5.  The use of long-term certificates means that credential expiration is not an availability issue.

However, we remain aware of the following issues with respect to availability:

1.  The policy system is vulnerable to misconfiguration, which could make PZPs unable to communicate.
2.  The availability of the OpenID provider is important, but is out of the control of webinos.
3.  Attacks on platform integrity from malware is not something we can mitigate.
4.  API-specific resource exhaustion attacks may be a problem. These are discussed in the API Security and Privacy Analysis section.

#### Data storage

The security of data used within webinos is largely dependent on the devices running webinos, and therefore is largely outside of the scope of the webinos architecture. The webinos implementation has avoided providing additional data encryption tools on grounds that most platforms already provide these options. In most cases, users have the tools available to protect themselves. The outstanding threats include:

-   Protecting valuable IPR stored within downloaded widgets. A solution to this problem would require Digital Rights Management. This is hard to implement across multiple platforms and is no longer within the scope of webinos.
-   Isolated data storage on windows and Linux. Native malware may be able to access webinos data as it is not protected on these systems by default.
-   PZH implementations may have varying levels of security from online attacks. We refer to the cloud security section to provide more details on potential solutions.
