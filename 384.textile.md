**<notextile>[Andrea Potilo] Thought 1 - Identifiers: </notextile>**
* Identifiers in webinos
**** A different identifier for device and service?
**** the device identifier could be (derived from) MAC or IP addresses?
**** the service id should be unique?
*** How much anonymity (unlinkability) should be achieved?
*** How accountability could be achieved in an anonymous Webinos Network?
**** what events/action/resources should be accountable?

**<notextile>[Ziran Samsung] Thought 2 - UserID registration: </notextile>**

Introduce a central "Longin server" in WebinOS Network for WebinOS ID registration and management?

in Skype, a "login server" has the following functions -
* Store User names and passwords
* User authentication at login
* Ensures that Skype login names are unique across the Skype name space

A WebinOs ID should at least formed with userid and device ID? So a full registration might look like â€“

-   In registration, user use one device (have public access â€“ â€œsuper deviceâ€?) to register with â€œlogin serverâ€. After successfully registered, it pass this information to all his/her devices ( Maybe authentication would also take place at this stage to make sure only his/her own devices got this userID). In return, each device pass their device ID to the â€œsuper deviceâ€.
-   Device ID will only be unique to a user. For devices belong to different users, the devices ID can be the same. Because unique â€œuseridâ€ should be enough to guarantee a unique â€œwebinos IDâ€ as I guess that â€œwebinOS IDâ€ should at least formed with userid and device ID.
-   â€œsuper deviceâ€ then returns his/her device lists to â€œlogin serverâ€. So â€œlogin serverâ€ shall now have a full list of â€œuser-id & device idâ€.

_Comment: we also want to avoid creating a separate identity just for Webinos. As a webinos user, I want to be able to identify through OpenID / Twitter / Facebook / My workplace._

**<notextile>[Dave Raggett, W3C] Thought 3 - Reducing the attack surface: </notextile>**

-   "Trusted Web Applications Considered Harmful":http://berjon.com/blog/2011/02/harmful-trust.html

Robin Berjon co-chair of W3C’s DAP WG notes that the use of interpreted scripting languages for web applications lays them wide open to risk of code injection through XSS bugs. This can occur in both client and server side code. It is very hard to develop safe applications, although the use of thoroughly tested security libraries can help.

-   "OWASP Enterprise Security API":http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Category:OWASP_Enterprise_Security_API
-   "HTML Purifier":http://htmlpurifier.org/

It’s not exactly as if XSS bugs were rare, either. Thomas Roessler has shown that Apple’s Dashboard widgets were frequently susceptible to such attacks. I’d be rather surprised if we couldn’t find such holes in widgets built using OMTP BONDI or JIL APIs (WAC 1.0 widgets are somewhat safer in that some of the more powerful APIs are not exposed yet).

Firefox extensions have very elevated privileges, but this is also bad news as a bug can give attackers access to the entire device. There are always bugs, so blind trust is scary! Signing an app to show that it has passed a certain level of scrutiny offers only weak assurances. Is it possible to define a new kind of sandbox with limited privileges and resistance to code injection attacks?

We should look at how to safely add features within the distributed code security boundary. This reduces the burden on web application developers, placing it instead on the browsers where it belongs.

**<notextile>[Dave Raggett, W3C] Thought 4 - Privacy friendly authentication: </notextile>**

Today’s practices for authentication on the Web are inadequate in a number of regards:

-   It is hard for most people to remember different ids and passwords for different sites. As a result, it is common for people to use the same id/password across many sites.
-   Users tend to pick easy to remember passwords, that are relatively easy to crack with dictionary attacks.
-   The common practice of using email addresses as identifiers facilitates linking personal data across websites.
-   Asking users to enter their id/password into web page forms facilitates phishing, where an attacker invites users to enter their credentials into a site that the user mistakes for the bona fide website.
-   The lack of usability for public key certificates, means that users will often overlook problems with certificates, for example, it is common to come across expired certificates, where sites have failed to renew them in a timely way. Phishing sites are able to obtain certificates with relative ease, and few users will check the certificate when the site appears sound (i.e. the browser displays the padlock icon for a secured page). This means that users don’t have a reliable and usable means to verify the sites authenticity
-   The practice of sending user id/password in the clear, as has been highlighted by the firesheep extension, which eavesdrops on unencrypted WiFi traffic to collect user ids/passwords.

It is therefore timely to consider new approaches for authentication on the Web, including the role of anonymous credentials as a way to ensure greater privacy.

The starting point is to avoid users typing credentials into a web page. We need a means for websites to indicate the requirements they have for authentication, and for browsers to authenticate users to the device, and the device to authenticate users to the website.
Mozilla have been exploring this with the Firefox Account Manager:

-   "Firefox Account Manager":https://wiki.mozilla.org/Labs/Weave/Identity/Account_Manager

This provides a clean user interface for users to sign on with a website, where the website describes its interface to the browser using a JSON-based declaration. Users never have to create or type their user id or password, as these are automatically created for them by the browser, with strong passwords that resist dictionary attacks. The approach can also be used with OpenID, but that is losing ground as its weaknesses have emerged.

I also like the idea of mutual authentication where the browser and website securely exchange secrets when setting up an account. Both parties use this to authenticate each other in subsequent visits.

-   "Mutual Authentication Protocol for HTTP":http://tools.ietf.org/id/draft-oiwa-http-mutualauth-08.txt

There has been work on this for some time in the IETF, and we could dust that off. I suspect that we could make do with fewer round trips than Oiwa et al. suggest.

-   "Boosting Privacy Online":http://www.w3.org/QA/2010/11/boosting_privacy_online_-_anon.html

This illustrates the role of zero knowledge proofs for proving to a website that the user is a member of a given group, or is at least 21 years old, or lives in a given city, but without disclosing any more. The above blog reports on work I did with IBM Research, Zurich, combining a Firefox extension with the identity mixer library. I am now planning on porting the core of the library to C for integration into webkit.

Government issued credentials such as the new German ID card could in principle be used together with zero knowledge proofs for privacy friendly authentication, where websites have the solid assurance of the strength of the credential, and only the minimal amount of personal data is transferred to the website, for example, that the user is of age, or lives in a given city or is of a particular gender.

Strong credentials could also be used to underwrite pseudonymous identities, where the user generates a new such identity for each site. Websites would then be able to verify that the person with a given pseudonymous identity has the stated properties, but without learning any more about who that user is. A break-the-glass mechanism would allow the true identity to be revealed under a court order in the eventuality of civil or criminal proceedings. It is time to widely deploy zero knowledge proofs for strong authentication on the Web!

When credentials are held on smart cards, USB sticks or other devices, including mobile phones, how does the browser discover them? A further challenge is to look at whether anonymous credentials should be integrated into the transport protocol (HTTP) or should remain at the layer above as in my demo.

**<notextile>[John Lyle, Oxford] Thought 5 - Device-specific security properties: </notextile>**

One of the big challenges faced by Webinos is that it needs to operate on devices in remarkably different contexts and with different hardware assumptions. For instance, mobile phones have fairly well-established device identifiers and roots of trust, whereas PCs have long resisted unique identifiers, most of which are unreliable (IP/MAC). Cars and set-top boxes are also likely to be different. Furthermore, each will have different levels of process isolation, and probably the webinos runtime will have different OS-level implementations. Some may support hardware roots of trust and attestation, others will not.

How do we let applications know the limitations of the devices without compromising privacy? And how do we let applications know this without trusting the devices overly?
