General
-------

This work area is about allowing web applications discover **Applications** and **Services** independently of where these resources are hosted, in the same device or in another device, and how they are accessed, through the Webinos Network or through a short range local peer-to-peer bearer such as Bluetooth, ANT+ or NFC.

A **Webinos Network** is an addressable logical grouping of one or many devices connected to one of many different IP subnet networks. The **Webinos Network** is an overlay network belonging to one user, a group of users or an organization. A device can be a member of one or many **Webinos Networks**.

A **Service** is an addressable logical functional entity that is exposed on a device or a server. The **Service** availability varies over time depending on the device status (on/off), service status (stopped/running/installed/uninstalled) and connection status (connected/disconnected). Examples of **Services** are:
* An API to get the temperature from a sensor
* A web API provided by a Web Server
* A remote control API provided by a TV

The **Discovery** procedure includes the means:
* for a **Service** to advertise its availability and capabilities
* for an **Application** to advertise its availability and capabilities
* for an **Application** to search for available **Services** in the current user device or anywhere else
* for an **Application** to search for other **Applications** in the current user device or in another device

Upon detection of a new **Service** Webinos shall be able to install new software resources or full applications needed to interwork with the new **Service** based on the **Service Description**, which is metadata about the **Service**.

Inputs to **Discovery** process
-------------------------------

-   A set of search criteria for requested **Service**, for example:
    > * Type of **Service**
    > * â€œProximity statusâ€ (search for services / applications in the proximity of the current user device or â€œanywhereâ€ in the cloud)
-   A set of search criteria for requested **Application**, for example:
    > * Type of **Application**
    > * **Application** owner

Outputs from **Discovery** process
----------------------------------

-   Address to the discovered **Application** or **Service**
-   Address to a software resource, e.g. a JavaScript lib, to support interworking with the discovered **Service**
-   Address to full **Application** tailored for utilizing the discovered **Service**
-   **Service Description** (meta data about the **Service**)
-   **Application Description** (meta data about the **Application**, â€œapplication manifestâ€)

Existing standards/technology

To be discussed
---------------

-   Do we need to separate **Applications** and **Services** / **Application Discovery** and **Service Discovery** or could **Applications** provide access to resources such as sensor APIs, Web Services, remote device APIs etc?
-   Should we separate **Device Discovery** from **Service/Application discovery**?
-   This must be aligned with the **Overlay Networking Model**
