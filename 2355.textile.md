Generic Actuator API
--------------------

### Overview of API

### Threats

#### API-Specific threats and misuse cases

1.  Misuse of an actuator could damage the underlying device or local environment. E.g., a motor could be used so frequently it gets too hot.
2.  Misuse of a battery-powered actuator could cause a denial of service through exhausting the battery.
3.  An actuator could be capable of harming people or the environment. E.g., actuators for home automation could cause temperatures to drop or rise too high
4.  Actuators may through success or error callbacks reveal information about the underlying device which could, in turn, be privacy sensitive. E.g. an actuator that has recently been used might be unusable for several minutes. This would therefore be a covert channel.
5.  An expensive to use actuator (e.g. one with a support service or one which uses a limited supply of raw materials) could be expensive for the end user if abused.
6.  An application or webinos flaw could allow an attacker to misuse **all** the actuator APIs at once. This would be spectacular!

There are likely to be more threats for each type of actuator - this threat analysis is vague by definition.

#### Threats based on remote invocation of this API from another device

1.  Remote invocation of an actuator could cause alarm or surprise by a user who is not expecting it.
2.  Remote invocation could cause battery life issues or denial of service if the user did not realise they were remotely invoking it.
3.  Remote invocation greatly increases the likelihood and success of many of the denial of service threats.

#### Implementation threats and possible attacks

This API has not been implemented.

Suspected implementation issues:

-   The underlying actuator is going to be controlled by a device driver. This driver may be running in kernel mode. It may have implementation flaws which are exploitable from API invocation, such as buffer overruns or double free vulnerabilities. This could cause remote code execution from webinos APIs.

#### Threats to apps and developers using this API (E.g. Jimmy and Jessica)

1.  The developer might design for the wrong kind of actuator and therefore accidentally damage the actuator that the API uses. They could be sued for this by angry users

#### Threats to device manufacturers, operators, other stakeholders

1.  Actuators related to a device might be damaged through unauthorised or inappropriate use. This could cause expense or product recalls.

### Mitigations

1.  When the actuator is used it ought to notify the user on the device he or she is using it from as well as the device it is connected to.
2.  Recommend to implementers of actuators that any free-form untyped text input ( actuatorType and actuatorId in the initActuatorEvent method ) should be validated properly.
3.  Recommend to implementers that rate limits are set where appropriate on actuators.
4.  User consent should be required _at least_ the first time the actuator is used
5.  When adding a new actuator, users should be alerted to warnings and, by default, policies should disallow access to this API remotely.
6.  Use of this API by an application should be logged
7.  If the actuator is expensive to use, or could be damaged through misuse, the manufacturer may want to allow access to it only from applications with the manufacturerâ€™s signature. A default policy might be bundled with the actuator driver
