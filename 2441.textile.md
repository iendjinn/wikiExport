Service Discovery RPC Messages
==============================

This section lists all RPC calls being made by the Service Discovery API (http://dev.webinos.org/specifications/new/servicediscovery.html).

DiscoveryInterface Interface
----------------------------

### findServices function

This RPC request/response handles the JS API call PendingOperation findServices(ServiceType serviceType, FindCallBack findCallBack, optional Options options, optional Filter filter);

#### Request

The method field must be "ServiceDiscovery.findServices". The params field is any array of length three containing the ServiceType, Options, and Filter object (exactly in this order) as defined in the Service Discovery API. This message allows for multiple results (FindCallBack.onFound) so that the id provided with the JSON-RPC message is used as object identifier for subsequent result messages.

_Note: Since service discovery is an inbuilt essential API it does not have a specific API type and instance ID._

Example:

<pre class="javascript">
JSON:
{
 id: "25"
 method: "DiscoveryInterface.findServices"
 params: {
 serviceType: {
 api: "http://webinos.org/api/exampleAPI"
 }
 filter: {},
 options: {}
 }
}
</pre>

FindCallBack Interface
----------------------

### Results from findServices / FindCallBack.onFound

Results of findServices will be partially used for the FindCallBack.onFound method as described in the Discovery API. After a findService request was made results can be received multiple times until no more service is found or findService is stopped. The method attribute consists of

-   id: the JSON-Request identifier used for the findService request where this message is an answer to / the identifier of the callback object that should be used to invoke onFound
-   the "." character as seperator
-   method name: the method name to be called on the receiving object that is identified by the id

The params object contains id, api, displayName, description, and an icon URI as specified in the Discovery API. These attributes need to be used to create a service object that is used as input parameter of the FindCallback used during the findService call. The additional serviceAddress parameter is an internal parameter to be used by the client side JavaScript binding of the API to address the service for subsequent calls.

Example:

<pre class="javascript">
JSON:
{
 method: "25.onFound"
 params: {
 "id": "6e6885b25a7ddb5f4658e7a599d1fc17",
 "api": "http://webinos.org/api/exampleAPI",
 "displayName": "Example Name",
 "description": "Example Module with the life answer.",
 "serviceAddress": "ExampleUser/ExampleUser_Pzp",
 "icon": null
 }
}
</pre>

### Results from findServices / FindCallBack.onLost

The message related to invoking the onLost method of a FindCallback is equal to the onFound method apart from the actual method name that must be "onLost" in this case.

### Results from findServices / FindCallBack.onError

In case of errors during findService the resulting JSON-Message consists of following attributes and values

-   method: value must be a DOMString containing "<id>.onError" where <id> is the JSON-Request identifier used for the findService request where this message is an answer to / the identifier of the callback object that should be used to invoke onError
-   params: value must be a DOMString that represents an DOMError as specified in the Discovery API.

Service Interface
-----------------

### Service.bind

PendingOperation bind(BindCallBack bindCallBack, DOMString serviceId)

The implementation and needs to be done during onBind (e.g. requesting hardware resources, setting up the service to be functional, etc) can be different between the APIs. If special data must be exchanged between client and service (e.g., to initialize the service) it is described in the respective API sections. If not the JSON message must contain following attributes and values:

-   method: "<type>@<instance>.Service.bind"
-   params: (optional) Unique id of the binding to the particular service as DOMString.

### Service.unbind

The implementation and needs to be done during onUnbind can be different between the APIs. If special data must be exchanged between client and service (e.g., to initialize the service) it is described in the respective API sections. If not the JSON message must contain following attributes and values:

-   method: "<type>@<instance>.Service.unbind"

BindCallBack Interface
----------------------

This sections defines the JSON-RPC protocol messages used for the BindCallback of the Discovery API

### BindCallBack.onBind

To call onBind the JSON-Message must consists of a method attribute and a params attribute that containing following values

-   method:"<id>.onBind" where <id> is the identifier of the callback object that should be used to invoke the method.
-   params: an object that describes the related service (an example of such an object is given in the findService section).

### BindCallBack.onUnbind

To call onUnbind the JSON-Message must consists of a method attribute and a params attribute that containing following values

-   method:"<id>.onUnbind" where <id> is the identifier of the callback object that should be used to invoke the method.
-   params: an object that describes the related service (an example of such an object is given in the findService section).

### BindCallBack.onServiceAvailable

To call onServiceAvaiable the JSON-Message must consists of a method attribute and a params attribute that containing following values

-   method:"<id>.onServiceAvailable" where <id> is the identifier of the callback object that should be used to invoke the method.
-   params: an object that describes the related service (an example of such an object is given in the findService section).

### BindCallBack.onServiceUnavailable

To call onServiceUnavailable the JSON-Message must consists of a method attribute and a params attribute that containing following values

-   method:"<id>.onServiceUnavailable" where <id> is the identifier of the callback object that should be used to invoke the method.
-   params: an object that describes the related service (an example of such an object is given in the findService section).

### BindCallBack.onError

To call onError the JSON-Message must consists of a method attribute and a params attribute that containing following values

-   method:"<id>.onError" where <id> is the identifier of the callback object that should be used to invoke the method.
-   params: value must be a DOMString that represents an DOMError as specified in the Discovery API.
