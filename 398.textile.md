### Privilege Apps and Services (Access Control)

[[3.1_Deliverable_Background_Privileged_Apps]]

Privilege Apps and services:
----------------------------

-   [[‘Privilege Apps and Services related to Browser and Policies’]]
-   [[‘Privilege Apps and Services Usecases, Requirements, Sequence Diagram’]] (Also Find the Actions points of the Conf call on 5/4/11 and 18/4/11)

Conference Calls / minutes
--------------------------

-   [[ConfCall 04/03/11, WP3.1 ‘Privilege applications’]]

Area Breakdown:
---------------

* Architecture and Third party appliactions related to ‘Privilege Applications’: refer BONDI
 Where and how can be policies enforced in the ‘Privileged Applications’ (BONDI)
 Note: Monitoring usually comes on the top in an Architecture

* Installing/Launching an application issuing permissions to an application running through the kernel level.

* Granting permissions, authorisation and Privileges to a specific user/application.

* Privilege Management/Handling and monitoring these applications.

* Areas relating to ‘Privilege Applications’ like how they are handled, what Standards to be use - refer ‘BONDI’ and ‘Android’

* Input and Output specifications for ‘Privileged Applications’ related to areas like ‘Policy Management’ and ‘Browser Handling/Plug-in’

* Whether to provide ‘Privileged Applications’ as local API’s to the Developers to add them in there applications or to have an Extension for applications (refer - BONDI).

Issues concerning:
------------------

1. Whether the Privilege applications are built in/ extensions to the Browser?
2. How can we enforce policies and security into these?
3. what standards can be used?
4. Some requirements to be identified and define specifications based on the inputs from WP2.
5. Where exactly does it fit in?? - Privilege applications lies in-between Policy/Security and Browser/Plug-in
6. And how do we manage Privilege Applications based on the Admin/Users point of view ??

### Working definition of ‘Privileged applications’

A Privileged application is an application that can override system controls and check for specific user IDs (UIDs), group IDs (GIDs), authorizations, or privileges. The access control elements are assigned by system administrators.

A privileged application is signed with a certificate that is in the privileged certificate store on the device. Target an application based on its Digital Certificate.

**Privileges** - A privilege is a discrete right that can be granted to an application. With a privilege, a process can perform an operation that would otherwise be prohibited. For example, processes cannot normally open data files without the proper file permission. Privileges are enforced at the kernel level.

**Authorizations** - An authorization is a permission for performing a class of actions that are otherwise prohibited by security policy. An authorization can be assigned to a role or user. Authorizations are enforced at the user level.

The difference between authorizations and privileges has to do with the level at which the policy of who can do what is enforced. Privileges are enforced at the kernel level. Without the proper privilege, a process cannot perform specific operations in a privileged application.

**Privilege Monitoring**: Privilege Monitoring will log privileged application activity that would fail under a standard user account. For an application to log activity you must enable Privilege Monitoring in the Application Privileges or Shell Integration sections of the policy, when you insert an application group.

**Installers**: A Privileged Application provides a policy based approach to privilege management. All users log on with standard user accounts and Privilege Application assigns the necessary rights and privileges to applications, scripts and software installers. Installers of the Privilege Application run through the console and client.

**Launcher**: The launchers of the Privilege application Policies for the users will automatically elevate these applications when they are launched.

**Policy Manager**: A Privilege Application is implemented as an extension to Group Policy, enabling policies to be managed through the standard Group Policy Management tools.

**Dashboard**: The Privileged Application can provide information related to Date, Event ID, Event Description, Username, PID, Parent PID, Policy, Application Group, Reason, Custom Token, Filename/Codebase, Type, Instances, Description, Certificate which can be shown in a Dashboard format for example to view in the form of graphs like area, bar, line and so on. Auditing and reporting capabilities can also be viewed by the help of Dashboards.

**Mobile**: If an application needs to run trusted process on a two-tier device, it needs to sign the application with a privileged certificate. The advantage of signing with a privileged certificate is that an application can call any API, and there are essentially no security restrictions on what your application can do.

**In Unix**: Device policy allows you more flexibility in granting permission to open devices. May require different privileges or more privileges than the default device policy. The privilege requirements can be modified for the device policy and for the driver proper. And can also modify the privileges when installing, adding, or updating a device driver.

**Privilege management**: creates, stores, and manages the attributes and policies needed to establish criteria that can be used to decide whether a userâ€™s request for access to some resource should be granted. Access control uses the data made available by authentication and privilege management, plus other information provided by the access request provider, such as the form of access requested to make an access control decision.

Privileges are assigned by an administrator. Privileges are enabled according to the design of the program. An application session is created and aÂ tokenÂ containing only the most basic privileges is assigned.Â 

### What input information is needed?

-   Use an isolated system: never debug privileged applications on a production system, as an incomplete privileged application can compromise security.
    Set IDs properly: The calling process needs the setid privilege in its effective set to change its user ID, group ID, or supplemental group ID. Set UID, GID programs. The effective UID is the owner of the program, while the real UID is the user of the program.

-   Use privilege bracketing: When an application uses privilege, system security policy is being overridden. Privileged tasks should be bracketed and carefully controlled to ensure that sensitive information is not compromised.

-   Start with the basic privileges: The basic privileges are necessary for minimal operation. A privileged application should start with the basic set. The application should then subtract and add privileges appropriately.

-   Avoid shell escapes: The new process in a shell escape can use any of the privileges in the parent process’s inheritable set. An end user can therefore potentially violate trust through a shell escape.

### What information does it provide?

The Privileged Application can provide information related to: Date, Event ID , Event Description, Username, Command Line, PID, Parent PID, Policy, Application Group, Reason, Custom Token, Filename/Codebase, Type, Instances, Description, Certificate, Hash/CLSID, Version (ActiveX only).

A privileged application can conduct sanity check on all the inputs. Input validation is actually part of the access control that a privileged application can conduct to ensure the security of the program. A lot of security problems are caused by the mistakes in input validation.

### What can we use from existing standards?

-   Common ActiveX Controls - The ActiveX Installer Service enables enterprises to delegate ActiveX control installation for standard users. Unlike other application types, Privilege application only manages the privileges for the installation of ActiveX controls. ActiveX controls usually require administrative rights to install, but once installed they will run with the standard privileges of the web browser.

-   User Privileges: Software Updaters, Notify, Set, Stutdown, Timezone, Undock Privileges.
     Admin Privileges: Backup, Debug, Createpagefile, LoadDriver, Remote Shutdown, Security Priveleges.

-   OCAP (OpenCable Application Platform) standardises such extensions to MHP (Multimedia Home Platform) â€“ is called â€œmonitor applicationâ€ MHP 1.2 adds â€œprivileged applicationsâ€ to give operators more control. It is an operating system layer designed for consumer electronics. OCAP, is an operating system layer designed for consumer electronics that connect to a cable television system, the Java-based middleware portion of the platform OCAP is the Java based software/middleware portion of the OpenCable initiative. OCAP is based on the Globally Executable MHP (GEM)-standard, and was defined by CableLabs. Because OCAP is based on GEM, it has a lot in common with the MHP -standard defined by the DVB project.
    
    h3. What do we need to define?
    
    * Groups, Privileges and Integrity Level for the access token.
    * Application Discovery: Privilege Guard policies may be defined to monitor privileged application behavior.
    * Policies- assign privileges to applications
-   Application Groups - define logical groupings of applications.
-   Messages - define end user messages.
-   Access Tokens - define custom access tokens.
-   Licensing - manage Privilege licenses.

### How much effort is this likely to be?
