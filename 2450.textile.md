Conclusion
==========

This deliverable presents the results of a large analysis of the webinos architecture with respect to security and privacy. We have incorporated data from related systems, academia, other webinos deliverables, the OWASP, CAPEC and CWE projects in order to assess the resistance of webinos to attacks and how it can be improved in the future. The document departs from the format of D3.5, in that all specifications for functionality can now be found in the D3.3 specification documentation.

As part of this work we have performed an architectural risk analysis, developed a threat model, analysed the majority of webinos APIs for security and privacy issues, performed an in-depth analysis of how webinos is affected by the use of cloud components, and presented a set of recommendations for stakeholders. In this final section we present our overall conclusions.

Summary of results
------------------

The webinos architecture, as specified in Deliverables 3.3 and 3.4 is resistant to several of the attacks described by attack patterns in the architectural risk analysis. While some unmitigated obstacles were found as part of the architectural risk analysis, many of these can be delegated to other entities such as the identity providers, operating systems and browser developers. Denial of service issues do not appear to be a great threat, and primarily affect components outside of webinos. Cloud security and privacy issues have been considered, including threats from hosting providers, errors in service migration and misuse of complex interfaces. However, assuming that best practices in cloud security are followed and that the scope of a webinos personal zone hub does not increase too dramatically this seems a reasonable risk considering the potential benefits. Furthermore, there is an opportunity for further research into mitigating some of the risks to cloud-based personal zone services. Finally, a significant number of API-related issues were identified and several mitigations have been designed and proposed for developers and specifiers.

Our analysis should not be considered final or complete. We have considered 14 attack patterns and 24 API specifications, but more exist and will need to be specified in the coming months. Our models of the webinos architecture can also be expanded to include more areas. However, the data we have presented is accurate, grounded in the specifications and results of previous deliverables, and covers a wide variety of functional areas in webinos.

The following changes to webinos may be considered as a result of this deliverable. Firstly, support for unmodified web browsers in webinos might be dropped in favour of customised webinos extensions. This will help satisfy many of the goals in the ambiguity analysis. The introduction of "Sensor Widgets" as described in ([[D036_References#Gibraltar|Gibraltar]]) may be considered in the final phase of the project to counter many API-specific misuse cases. Some APIs could be improved for less trusted applications, such as the messaging and discovery APIs. With regards to the overall system architecture, the webinos personal zone hub could benefit from restructuring to minimise the burden placed on any individual cloud provider.

Making use of these findings in webinos
---------------------------------------

These findings can be used by webinos in the following ways:

1.  The threat model can be used to check design decisions and to justify the placement of new features
2.  Obstacle models and the leaf obstacles can be used to motivate and encourage the development of the platform
3.  The API analysis will be used by implementers and specifiers to avoid the threats identified.
4.  This process can be integrated with the requirements update process to make sure that new features, proposed internally or externally, do not violate any of the security assumptions or existing mitigations in the architecture
5.  The recommendations from the ‘summary’ page of the architectural risk analysis can inform the roadmap of webinos deliverables

Making use of these findings outside of webinos
-----------------------------------------------

Because the process followed in the architectural risk analysis is novel and based on publically-available data on threats and weaknesses, we intend to publish our findings and data on a public GitHub repository. This will allow other projects to identify how we have performed our analysis and compare with their own. It will also allow implementers, application developers, platform integrators and others to assess the risks involved with using webinos and whether it matches their environment. We also believe it will be useful as a source of material for academic data.

We have also proposed a set of recommendations for stakeholders within webinos, with particular emphasis on identity providers, pzh providers, device manufacturers and application developers. We have also outlined some key mitigations to security issues associated with the APIs being standardised by webinos which will be useful for any developers wishing to extend the platform.

Future security and privacy activities in webinos
-------------------------------------------------

The work described in this deliverable provides a consistent framework for changing and updating the security and privacy features in webinos. Security and privacy activities in webinos continue after August 2012, and during the remaining time we intend to do the following:

1.  Integrate the data security and API analysis with the formal CAIRIS-based process
2.  Create more attack patterns and integrate the draft patterns using CAIRIS.
3.  Search for more input from outside sources of threats and weaknesses, such as the Cloud Security Alliance and privacy literature.
4.  Analyse the remaining APIs not covered in this deliverable.
5.  Begin the process of addressing the weaknesses and ambiguities identified in the system specifications.
6.  Update the attacker personas; these were found useful during the creation of attack patterns - to represent more relevant attackers. In particular, attackers of cloud systems.
7.  Make use of the premortems approach described in ([[D036_References#Faily2012|Faily2012]])
