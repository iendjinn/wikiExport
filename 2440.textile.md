Task 3.4 Delivery
-----------------

Delivery wiki page is here: http://dev.webinos.org/redmine/projects/t3-4/wiki/Task_34_Deliverable

-   Introduction and Web Application API Landscape sections: Written by Claes but Introduction still to be done. Happy for review comments.

-   Background information on Webinos phase 1 APIs removed in phase 2: Basically completed

-   Background information on further development of Webinos phase 1 APIs: **Action for all API owners to edit sections for APIs of your responsibility.** Should describe what has been updated in the API specification compared to phase 1 and the rationale for this. If appropriate also state ideas for further development of the API. Could be based on the information in "API specification alignment with task 4.1 API implementations and further work on the APIs":http://dev.webinos.org/redmine/projects/t3-4/wiki/API_specification_alignment_with_task_41_API_implementations. Deadline August 26.

-   Background information on new Webinos APIs added in phase 2: **Action for all API owners to edit sections for APIs of your responsibility** Should describe rationale behind each new API added in Webinos phase 2 based on the information provided at "New proposed Webinos APIs":http://dev.webinos.org/redmine/projects/t3-4/wiki/New_proposed_Webinos_APIs and linked pages., i.e. scenarios, use cases, high level requirements, investigations on candidate existing APIs etc. Deadline August 26.

-   Suggestions for referred APIs - proposals for standardization input: **Actions for all owners of referred standard APIs from W3C to, if applicable, list proposals for input to standardization based on Webinos use cases, requirements, implementation experience etc.** The actual work with the relevant standardization organizations is then performed within task 8.2. Deadline August 26.

-   Web Intents for Webinos investigation: Written by Claes and John. Ready for review.

-   Webinos phase 2 API specifications: Link to Webinos Phase 2 Device API specifications. Of course the main part of the delivery. **Action for all API editors to edit the final version of the API specification.** Deadline August 26.

Pending Operation, cancel() method for asynchronous operations
--------------------------------------------------------------

Referring to discussion on wp3 mailing list a summary of the conclusions are:

-   There is no requirement to have a general cancel() method for all asynchronous APIs. The need for a cancel() must be judged from API to API.

-   In those cases when a cancel() method is specified the semantics for cancel must be stated.

-   As cancel() is not currently implemented for any Webinos API we need more investigations and implementation experiences to be able to definitively define the approach here.

Recommendations for APIs based on an initial security analysis
--------------------------------------------------------------

See Jonhâ€™s mail: https://listen.fokus.fraunhofer.de/sympa/arc/webinos-wp3-ml/2012-08/msg00147.html

Most recommendations deal with API implementation but may also impact the specification.

**Action for all API owners to check the security analysis as basis for potential API specification modifications.**

Berlin meeting
--------------

Task 3.4 has half a day. The plan is a to have a starting joint session on common issues and then split into smaller groups for detailed discussions. **Action Claes to create a proposal for group division.**
