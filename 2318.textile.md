PZP
===

{{toc}}

A webinos personal zone enables communication between personal devices and services. A personal zone comprises of two entities, a PZH (Personal Zone Hub) and PZP (Personal Zone Proxy). A "PZH":http://dev.webinos.org/redmine/projects/wp3-3/wiki/PZH_Introduction is an entity that runs in the cloud and on publicly accessible IP address. A webinos-enabled device that supports running of the services is referred to as Personal Zone Proxy (PZP).

A PZP can connect to other PZPs in a personal zone. To achieve this, a PZP has to be enrolled in a personal zone. Once enrolled, the PZP is capable of connecting to the PZH, peers and devices outside the personal zone. A PZP can also be hosted on the cloud to provide services across PZPs such as context database.

A PZP is a composition of different functionalities. It is a TLS Client to the PZH and Peer PZPs, and hosts a TLS server to allow Peer PZPs to connect. It provides similar functionality as a PZH of routing, policy enforcement, service discovery, and synchronization and is capable of running in the cloud too. A PZP differs from a PZH, as it is capable of hosting services and executing the remote RPC calls but cannot perform enrolling and revocation of a device in the personal zone.

All PZPs whether on device or in cloud should be ran as a daemon/service on a webinos-enabled device so as to allow connections to other devices in the zone, when requested. A PZP has various modes of operation, which define its authentication and other states. These modes include when device is not enrolled in personal zone, connected to PZH, and connected to peers. PZPs also provide a set of user preferences including port configurations, synchronisation and connection options.

In this specification we cover following PZP functionality:
* PZP TLS client and server connection
* PZP modes and states
* User Preference options

PZP TLS Client and Server Connection
------------------------------------

A PZP is a client to a PZH TLS server, it connects to PZH to route and synchronise with other peer PZPs. In a local area network, the PZP can connect to peer PZP directly without aid from PZH using local discovery mechanism such as ZeroConf. But in remote scenario to connect to the PZP in same personal zone, it has to rely on the routing service provided by the PZH. Once enrolled and synchronized the PZP can work on their own in offline scenario.

### TLS Servers on the PZP

| Port | 8040, if changed PZP should update PZH |
| Description | Incoming connections from PZPs (zone devices) as well as connections from external (friend) PZPs. |
| Parameters | rejectUnauthorized = true (unauthorized certificate connection is rejected)
 requestCert = true (this is to enable mutual authentication) |
| Trusted certificates | PZP CA certificates & trusted external PZH master certificates |
|/3. Authentication | Entities with PZP certificates we don’t recognise must go through the peer-to-peer certificate exchange process|
 | Entities with PZP certificates from other zones are assumed to belong to the user connected to the PZH CA certificate in the chain |
 | Entities with PZP certificates from the personal zone are assumed to be the same user |

### Outgoing TLS connections on the PZP

| Port | Random port |
| Description | Outgoing connections to other PZPs and PZH |
| Parameters | |
| Trusted certificates | Just the certificate of the PZP CA we are contacting, if they are known. If not, then just our own CA certificate. |
|/4. Authentication | The remote party must use the certificate we are expecting, if we are expecting one. |
 | If the remote party is new (e.g. we have not connected to them before, no certificate known) follow the peer-to-peer certificate exchange process |
 | The remote party user identity must be mapped to the identity of its master CA certificate |

PZP Identity
------------

The PZP are assigned identity that is bound to their owner’s identity. An identity assigned to the PZP is of form the PZH identity followed by the device name, as described in the [[Entity Definitions]] documentation.

PZP Modes - Connection States
-----------------------------

The PZP can be in several different states depending on whether it is connected to a PZH or not and depending on whether it has been enrolled in the personal zone.

1.  Virgin Mode: This is a special case before a PZP enrolment. A PZP not enrolled cannot connect to a PZH. It does not have certificates which allow it to establish a TLS connection with the PZH. A PZP can still operate and provide local services but cannot connect to the other PZPs in the personal zone.
2.  Hub Mode : This is the mode where the PZP can connect to the PZH and has been enrolled with the PZH.
3.  Local Peer Mode: This is a mode where PZP can connect to other PZP directly using a local discovery protocol. If connected to the PZH it gets information about peer PZPs.

These states, as well as intermediaries, can be seen in the following state chart:

The above state machine shows that in hub mode, a PZP can be in several sub-states depending on whether it is connected to the PZH at that particular time.

### Virgin mode

This mode is a special case before a PZP enrolment. This mode specifies, that a PZP has not connected to any personal zone and has not been issued with a certificate. A PZP trying to connect to PZH for the first time will be in virgin mode, and after retrieving certificates it will move into hub mode.

A PZP in virgin mode can be in these possible states:
# Virgin : A PZP has tried connecting to the PZH but failed to get certificates or it has not tried connecting at all. It tries to resolve DNS address of PZH provider and if successful goes into connecting state.
# VirginConnecting : A PZP has started connecting to the PZH, depending on device this state could be longer (Mobile connection) or just a transition state. After timeout or in the case that authentication fails or socket hangup it will go back to the ‘Virgin’ state. If the connection is successful and the PZP authenticates to the PZH it will move to a VirginConnected state. In connecting state, a PZP will go though the authentication and enrolment process.
# VirginConnected : This temporary state allows the PZP to download permanent PZP certificates from the PZH and store them. When this has been done successfully, the PZP can re-connect to the PZH and enter HubMode. If there is an error of any kind it will go back to Virgin mode.

If Virgin mode is successful then device should be issued with all the certificates necessary to connect to a PZH.

### Hub Mode

The PZP that have certificates from a PZH are in hub mode. When a PZP is started on a device which has been enrolled previously, it begins in the "NotConncted" state.

1.  Not connected: The PZP that are not connected to the PZH but have the certificate. It is not currently able to establish socket/IP connection with the PZH. This could be due to the PZH non-availability or the PZP not having network connection (Example 3G Network Not working and device is not connected to WiFi)
2.  Connecting : The PZP are triggered manually or automatically for connecting with the PZH. If successful device goes in the connected state.
3.  Connected : The PZP will be in connected state depending on the optimization. In case of a error or timeout or hangup, it goes to disconnected state before going back to not connected state. When in connected state it can trigger peer connection to be initialized.
4.  Disconnecting: This is a small transition state where clean up operations will take place. After this the PZP will go into not connected state

### Connecting to local peers

The PZP can communicate with peer PZP if they are in near proximity and have a common communication method, such as WLAN. This allows PZPs to establish communication with peer PZP without support from the PZH. This is useful as it eliminates communication overhead and could potentially save user money if paid communication service is being used for communication between the PZP and the PZH.

Peer communication is triggered by a PZP via JavaScript APIs. This causes the PZP to try and find devices within proximity using local discovery protocols. Once peer PZPs are found the PZP can establish communication directly based on the certificates they hold or based on the peer-to-peer authentication process SHCBK (described in the [[Personal Zone Key Infrastructure]] section).

In addition, a PZP will listen for incoming connection requests from peers, if the user has allowed it. This is shown on the left-hand side of the state diagram below.

The following state diagram shows the different states that a PZP may be in when establishing connections with peers. Several peers are able to connect at any time.

### Connecting to peers through the PZH.

PZPs can communicate with other PZPs by sending messages to the PZH. This will route the messages appropriately. The PZP is communicated by the PZH about the list of other connected PZP’s IP addresses and port they are connected. The PZP if required can connect to the peer directly. This is mostly useful in scenario when two PZP’s has to do media streaming.

User Preferences
----------------

The PZP has certain set of parameters that are user configurable. These configurations have a default behaviour and if user want to change they can specify in these preferences. These preferences are applicable before PZP starts connecting to the PZH. Once the PZP is connected the selected preferences will take effect and any changes will only take affect the next time a PZP reconnects to the PZH. These preferences dictates the PZP connection behavior such as ports configuration, preferences for synchronisation, clear application contents, synchronization options and connection preference(hub/peer).

-   Synchronisation: The default behaviour is to synchronise all items across PZP’s, but user can select individually what items to synchronize.
-   Application Content: Applications running on the local device and communicating with the PZP will save their contents by default. If user wishes to delete data after session end could opt in. This deletes all application contents, once the PZP is disconnected from the peer PZP or PZH.
-   Connection preference: The PZP connects by default to the PZH, and then based on JavaScript API invocation it connects to other PZP in its own zone. User can select an option by default to connect to peer mode, with this option device would always connect to peers instead of connecting to PZH. Peers could update device about certificates and policy via synchronization. This preference is per PZP device.
