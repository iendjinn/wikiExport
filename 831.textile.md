Spec - Authentication ModifiedScenario1
=======================================

Major changes compared to Scenario 1:
* authentication is detailed further
* set-up of secure channel is detailed further
* sequence of message flow is changed so that repeatedly required messages are always the same regardless of the purpose of establishing the connection
* establishing connection between two devices of the same zone is always the same regardless of availability of the PZH. Only the steps before establishing the connection differ.
