The W3C File API - Directories and System
-----------------------------------------

### Overview of API

http://www.w3.org/TR/2012/WD-file-system-api-20120417/
http://www.w3.org/TR/file-system-api/

Provides means to navigate file system hierarchies.
Provides means to expose sandboxed sections of a userâ€™s local filesystem.

### Threats

#### API-Specific threats and misuse cases

1.  This API could be used to navigate file system directories and other local applications directories.
2.  It can take file system resources inappropriately using storage request API.
3.  It can prevent legitimate data access moving local or remote files
4.  it can delete data removing local or remote files

For example, if access to critical file, like credential ones (e.g. password or private key) is incorrectly allowed, Frankie (the alienated script kiddie) may be able to delete them, in fact "disconnecting" the device from the zone (since no longer able to authenticate versus the other devices), just to make "funny" annoyance to "friends"

#### Threats based on remote invocation of this API from another device

#### Implementation threats and possible attacks

1.  Some operations invalidate the entry/blob used, e.g., remove. The implementation does not keep track of the entries/blobs returned, creating copies if the same entry/blob is requested multiple times, thus not propagating invalidation to all affected objects. The validation process is left to the underlying system. This could create integrity weaknesses (entries supposed to be deleted but yet there), and allow for persistent presence of entries, which could lead to information leakage if sensitive information are not properly deleted.

#### Threats to apps and developers using this API (E.g. Jimmy and Jessica)

Developers could experience some discrepancies between actual implementation and expected behavior

1.  Certain UAs, i.e., Browsers. In order to manage origin-private filesystems within webinos, additional information is required
2.  Encoding Subtleties: The W3C File API specification(http://www.w3.org/TR/FileAPI/) requires the IANA: Character Sets to be supported (http://www.iana.org/assignments/character-sets). Internally, JavaScript uses UTF-16; the implementation uses UTF-8 and currently ignores any given encoding. This direct manipulation have to pay attention to not introduce encoding mismatch.
3.  Some operations, e.g., removeRecursively, could continue after the occurrence of an error or exception. This implementation works differently, aborting any operation that encounters an error or exception. Thus, an operation may partially succeed, e.g., removeRecursively may remove some (up to the occurrence of an error or exception) but not all children of a directory. The app developer have to understand and check the success of those commands to avoid damage and leave the system in inconsistent state.
    Presumably an inconsistent delete operation might result in private/valuable data not being deleted, which might cause embarrassment due to unexpected data disclosure. E.g., when selling an old device, or even affect valuable intellectual property.

#### Threats to device manufacturers, operators, other stakeholders

No obvious threats. Not much significantly, an attacker could navigate the OS file system and move or delete OS files, causing OS instability and bad user experience.

### Mitigations

1.  For developers threats, provide examples which clarify how the API works for each ambiguous case
2.  Each application could have a filesystem section devoted to its own files. File system navigation, movement, copy and deletion outside this area should be denied, as well as "anonymous" file system access

### Recommended default policy rules for applications

  ------------- ------------------------------------------------------
  _.Code   _.Type
  B-A           Browser-based, authenticated via TLS certificates
  W-R           Widget, authenticated using a recognised certificate
  W-U           Widget, unrecognised
  ------------- ------------------------------------------------------

  _.B-A   _.W-R   _.W-U   _.Policy                       _.Explanation (Widgets)                                                                                                                             _.Explanation (Browser Apps)                                                                                                      Silently allow                        2. Applications will be granted access to this API without user consent being required. This can only be modified using a policy editor.
  X            X                         Default allow (install time)        Widgets will need user consent at install time, but users will expect to allow it (the tick-box will automatically be filled in).                        Web pages will prompt for consent (Yes / No / Always) at runtime, this preference will be saved.
                            X            Default ask at runtime (one-shot)   Widgets will require one-off user consent at runtime. This fact will be visible & modifiable at install time.                                            Web pages will prompt for consent (Yes / No / Always) at runtime, this preference will be saved.                                       Default ask at runtime (every time)   Widgets will require user consent at runtime, every time. This fact will be visible & modifiable at install time.
                                         Default deny (install time)         Widgets will require user consent at install time, but users will expect NOT to allow it (the tick-box will automatically be empty).                     Web pages will display a short notification at first-use saying that access was denied, with a button to change settings
                                         Silently deny                       2. Applications will not be granted access to this API, and users will not be asked at install time. This can only be modified using a policy editor.
