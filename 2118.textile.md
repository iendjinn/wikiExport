PZP PZH Connection Discussion
=============================

This page is based on an email discussion initiated by Nick.

-   PZP for android/ windows/linux want to run as a service (or the equivalent for that platform), and default behaviour is to autostart

[JOHN] _This should be made clear on install. We ought to define default (and pessimistic) access control rules_

[PAOLO] _I agree with John that we need to define access control rules. Having pzp that autostarts it’s okay. But what if the device isn’t connected? It needs to check if connection is available and connects automatically to the last pzh. Otherwise it’d remain in virgin mode._

-   We need a URL which maps to a PZP configuration administration page.
    -   This URL can be bookmarked and accessed from any browser on that device (indeed it will work remotely from another device â€“ if you know the IP address â€“possible security problem?)

[JOHN] _Definite security problem, I’d say. This should be limited to this device only. Perhaps it requires the browser to have a specific certificate installed._

[PAOLO] _What about the WRT? Do we have bookmarks in our runtimes or are we talking about accessing the page from a browser anyway?_

**** The renderer (where it exists on the platform) will have an administration menu (sub menu) option to take you to this URL within the renderer
* PZP Admin page: functionality required
**** Is PZP running â€“ simple ping test - e.g. does get42 work (green red icon)..
**** PZP auto start option
*** Plus manual start
*** Plus manual stop
* PZH connection â€“ a visual indicator on whether this is a virgin PZP, or has a hub but is not connected, or has a hub and IS connected. [JOHN] _(fixed for notation)_
* Enrolment options a list of options to enrol a PZP â€“ the simplest of which is manually enter code

[JOHN] _This functionality has to exist at the PZH not PZP._

[PAOLO] _I agree with John, but having some kind of feedback on the PZP it might be also useful. So far, the only way to know it it’s working it’s manually do the get42_

-   Enrolment diagnostics- any specific feedback that may be needed â€“ to show how far through enrolment process we have got

Can you give some examples?

-   View Log: simple view of basic diagnostic logs (is this output of the PZP process or more?)
-   Other Devices â€“ a list of all other devices that this PZH/PZP is aware of (I know this will need sync activating) This list should show
    -   Devices common name
    -   Whether connected via PZH â€“ assumes you can see PZH â€“ and other device also can see PZH
    -   Connected/discoverable via PZP (assumes zeroconf discovery)
    -   Services list â€“ shows list of all services: makes a distinction between
        -   Cached service list â€“ service I have found on this device before
        -   Active services â€“ services I am currently connected to ( I know are live â€“ have check > 5 mins ago)
-   Other people: same as above â€“ but at the higher level of abstraction where I can see a view of my â€œwebinos friendsâ€ â€“ specifically this means people I have exchanged certificates with
-   APIs: this is a list of webinos APIs installed on this device â€“ and on which we can run the diagnostic test locally â€“ to see how complete the implementation is
    -   E.g. will list sensors , file, contacts â€“ with green/red indicator and percentage test complete etc
-   Services (not totally complete yet): this should be a list of service widgets. These are widgets on PZP â€“ that have a main.js start.

[JOHN] _Can we have a discussion about this? AFAIK, "service widgets" isn’t in spec, requirements or in any way implemented…? This kind of thing needs to be defined in order for us to have any chance of doing a proper security analysis_

**** Each service widget should have
*** Is it running or not
*** Admin settings to set to auto start
*** Config page â€“ link to Url from which customs settings of the service can be changed
** An example of a service widget is
*** A http server
*** A gelocation logger â€“ which broadcasts location at 1-10 minute intervals
***** A hear rate monitor gateway - like zirans current demo â€“ but with no UI â€“ but brodcasts data to PZH â€“ or another application

[PAOLO] I think that all that is out of specs. It’s good that this page is posted here, so the task leader could take this into consideration.

Other than the implementation details of running as a service â€“ most of the code should be platform independent node code
