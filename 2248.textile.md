The W3C Gallery API
-------------------

### Overview of API

http://dev.w3.org/2009/dap/gallery/

Provides access to the media gallery.

NOTE: at the moment there is not implementation (deferred to phase 2) and no final decision about the specification (the W3C Gallery is a little outdated). Thus, only quite vague threats are mentioned.

### Threats

#### API-Specific threats and misuse cases

1.  This API could be used to access sensitive multimedia data stored in a local or remote gallery.
2.  Adding objects to the gallery an attacker could fill the file system.

An attack perpetrated by an evil person could discredit or embarrass a specific individual, accessing sensible photos and even allowing for ransom in the worst cases.
The integrity of photos and gallery must be assured as well, to avoid possible cases of vilification (e.g. by changing a photo with a modified one).

#### Threats based on remote invocation of this API from another device

#### Implementation threats and possible attacks

#### Threats to apps and developers using this API (E.g. Jimmy and Jessica)

#### Threats to device manufacturers, operators, other stakeholders

### Mitigations

1.  The Gallery implementation should impose restrictions to the gallery size,

### Recommended default policy rules for applications

  _.Code   _.Type
  B-A           Browser-based, authenticated via TLS certificates
  W-R           Widget, authenticated using a recognised certificate

Applications will be granted access to this API without user consent being required. This can only be modified using a policy editor.
  X                                      Default allow (install time)        Widgets will need user consent at install time, but users will expect to allow it (the tick-box will automatically be filled in).                        Web pages will prompt for consent (Yes / No / Always) at runtime, this preference will be saved.
                            X            Default ask at runtime (one-shot)   Widgets will require one-off user consent at runtime. This fact will be visible & modifiable at install time.                                            Web pages will prompt for consent (Yes / No / Always) at runtime, this preference will be saved.                                        Default ask at runtime (every time)   Widgets will require user consent at runtime, every time. This fact will be visible & modifiable at install time.
                                         Default deny (install time)         Widgets will require user consent at install time, but users will expect NOT to allow it (the tick-box will automatically be empty).                     Web pages will display a short notification at first-use saying that access was denied, with a button to change settings
                                         Silently deny                       2. Applications will not be granted access to this API, and users will not be asked at install time. This can only be modified using a policy editor.
