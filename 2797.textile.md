Differences between webinos phase 2 API specifications and webinos final API specifications
===========================================================================================

The following major changes have been done in the webinos final API specification delivery compared to the webinos phase 2 API specification delivery (D3.4):

Media Play API added
--------------------

The "Webinos MediaPlay":http://dev.webinos.org/specifications/api/mediaplay.html API can be used to invoke and control playback of media files in external media player software, on the userâ€™s current device or on another device, instead of using playback in the widget/browser runtime.

Use cases are for example:

-   The format of the media file is not supported by the widget/browser runtime so an external media player has to be used
-   The user just prefers to use another media player than the widget/browser runtime even though the file format is supported in the widget/browser runtime
-   The user wants to play the media file using a media player on a remote device

Event Handling API added
------------------------

The "webinos Event Handling API":http://dev.webinos.org/specifications/api/events.html has been added. An earlier version of this API was included in the webinos phase 1 API specifications delivery but was removed in the phase 2 delivery as the intention was to replace it with the "App2App MessagingAPI":http://dev.webinos.org/specifications/api/app2app.html.

However, there are a lot of existing applications that are using this API and it has also been said that the App2App Messaging API (the successor) is more difficult to use and doesnâ€™t work for some use cases. It was therefore decided to keep both APIs.

Payment API
-----------

The "shopping basket" functionality has been removed from the webinos Payment API. It is now a pure in-app payment API.

Most APIs inherits the Service Discovery API Service interface
--------------------------------------------------------------

One of the key elements of Webinos is that the framework provides means to bind to a service object in a remote execution environment. The "Webinos Discovery API":http://dev.webinos.org/specifications/api/servicediscovery.html defines how a service is discovered and how an application can bind to a remote service. The service object will act as proxy for sending/receiving events to/from the remote peer and hides the complexity of sending/receiving message between the peers in a trusted manner.

Most webinos APIs define services that are discoverable through the Webinos Discovery API and are therefore not exposed directly under the window.webinos object. Instead these APIs inherit the general Service Interface that is defined in the Webinos Discovery API. A major update of most API specifications has been done to state that the main interface in the specification inherits the Service interface.

Feature strings
---------------

Each API declares the features of this API. The feature URIs are used by the developer in:

â€¢ The application’s config.xml file to declare requested features.
â€¢ As identifier for serviceType in the webinos Discovery API’s findServices() method.

For this delivery the set of feature URIs have been updated to be hierarchical for functionality provided, e.g. http://webinos.org/api/sensors/light or http://webinos.org/api/contacts/read.

Sensor and Actuator APIs JSON values
------------------------------------

In previous webinos deliveries the Sensor and Actuator read and write values were arrays of float values with different meaning depending on sensor or actuator type. This is now changed to JSON objects, which provides more flexibility and clarity for developers. In addition developers can use the built in JS JSON manipulation methods when using these APIs.

Calendar and Messaging APIs removed
-----------------------------------

These two APIs were removed as they have not been implemented in WP4. If, during further development of the webinos platform by webinos Foundation, use cases requiring these APIs needs to be supported it is suggested that the "W3C SysApps":http://www.w3.org/2012/sysapps/ "Messaging API":http://www.w3.org/2012/sysapps/messaging/ and Calendar API are implemented. The latter API has not yet been specified by the SysApps WG but is planned as a "SysApps phase 2 delivery":http://www.w3.org/2012/sysapps/#future .

Service Discovery API, Service interface inherits DOM EventTarget interface.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Applications that use the Sensor and/or Actuator interfaces use the standard addEventListener and removeEventListener methods of the DOM EventTarget interface to start and stop listening to events with sensor / actuator values. In previous webinos deliveries there was a specification error that no relation with the DOM EventTarget interface was defined. This has now been corrected so the Service Discovery API Service interface inherits the DOM EventTarget interface. Applications that use an API that inherits the Service Discovery API Service interface, for example the Discovery and Actuator interfaces, can thus use the standard addEventListener and removeEventListener methods.

Added the â€œcacheâ€ Filter Dictionary member to the Service Discovery API.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

This option makes it possible for an application to define if the search for a service should be done based on cached information in the PZP on the users current device or if the search should be performed directly, with the actual external devices within the user’s personal zone or in other personal zones to check the actual availability of the searched service.

Miscellaneous detailed changes in several APIs to align with webinos implementation experiences
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A number of smaller fixes have been done based on webinos implementation, for example attributes or method argument name changes or other syntax changes.
