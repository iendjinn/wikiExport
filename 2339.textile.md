Abstract
========

This deliverable describes in detail the system architecture of the Phase II webinos platform.

The primary areas covered in this deliverable are the detailed technical specifications for all of the major components of a webinos system; including the Personal Zone Proxy (PZP), Personal Zone Hub (PZH), common components of both PZPs and PZHs, and also the application interface. We also include an informative specification section detailing how some of the components work together and can be deployed.

This deliverable does not include specification of the webinos APIâ€™s, neither does it address the security and privacy issues which motivate much of the architecture. Those aspects of the webinos platform are covered in Deliverables D3.4 and D3.6 respectively.

This deliverable consists of six separate sub-specifications and a Glossary document

HLS - webinos Phase II architecture and components - High Level Specification
Glos - webinos Phase II architecture and components - Glossary
PZP - webinos Phase II architecture and components - Personal Zone Proxy Specification
microPZP - webinos Phase II architecture and components - Micro Personal Zone Proxy Specification
PZH - webinos Phase II architecture and components - Personal Zone Hub Specification
Core - webinos Phase II architecture and components - Common/Core Components Specification
Apps - webinos Phase II architecture and components - Applications Specification
Inf - webinos Phase II architecture and components - Informative Specification
