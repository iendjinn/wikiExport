### WP3 Berlin Meeting Preparation

We will follow the suggestion from Nick for the meeting preparation:

WP3 Meetings:
* (a) Require (in advance of meeting) and update on status â€“ it should include:
# Progress made (with resources expended)
# Planned next steps (actions) + anticipated resources
# Decisions that need to be made â€“ and communicated

-   Update on status should be received (in advance of meeting) aim of meeting is to only discuss (3). - project management issues only should be raised if we have delayed actions â€“ and mostly dealt with offline .

Provide a status and planning report for your work areas in preparation for the Berlin meeting.
Prepare a list of discussions and decisions that need to be made during the meeting.

I will set up a Wiki page for that and give some more information in a separate e-mail.

AP: Prepare Wiki page and send meeting preparation mail to list: Christian Fuhrhop
AP: Prepare status/planning reports for Berlin meeting: All work area coordinators.

### Future WP3 Phone Conferences

Next week the WP3 phone conference will be primarily preparation for the Berlin meeting. Due to Easter vacations, there probably won’t be much work done between this week’s and next week’s phone conferences, so we’ll skip the status report.

After Berlin, we will try to follow the suggestion for the meeting preparation, i.e. prepare status and planning in advance of the phone conference and only deal with discussions and decisions in the phone conference itself.

### Individual work areas

#### User ID and Data Management

Currently fleshing out the specification.
Direct talks to Discovery and Overlay Network groups.

#### Policy Management

Definition of XML to realize work requirements and handling of policies in the cloud.

#### Device, Application and Service Discovery

Current focus is on application discovery.
A specific phone conference will be held next week.

#### Web application packaging, handling and Web Runtime specification

Not much activity in the moment, only minor refinements since last week.

#### ‘Privileged applications’

Currently in communication / coordinating with policy management group.

#### Analytics / Metrics

Considering to base analytics on data derived from context/content management/adaptation task with the option to merge the areas.

#### Event handling

Taxonomy completed, rules completed, standard events defined, architecture extended, experimental coding

#### Browser plug-in / extension handling

Primary options are NPAPI and Chrome Extensions. Not clear at the moment whether this is an either/or decision or both approaches can be combined. Needs to be decided in Berlin meeting.

#### Overlay networking model

Discovery research/testing done, current work on streaming issues, experimenting with WiFi robot.
To support a simple overlay network model a trust model needs to be established.
A paper is prepared and will be presented at the "FSW 2011 : Federated Social Web Europe Conference" in Berlin in June.

#### Context Awareness and Adaptation

Current issue is how to combine context management and content adaptation (and possibly Analytics/Metrics) seamlessly.
Work on definition of context model and representation model.
RDFa or XML ontology considered.
Open question whether to store information on device or in cloud. Decision probably mid-May, which might cause delays critical for end of June deliverable. Not critical, but needs to be watched.

AP: Watch time management on Context Awareness and Adaptation and ensure commitment of partners involved for critical period in May/June: Christian, Heiko, George G.

### AOB

George Gionis (probably together with Heiko and Hans) will probably also present a webinos based paper at the "FSW 2011 : Federated Social Web Europe Conference" in Berlin in June.
