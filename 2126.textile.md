Instructions
------------

-   The mapping consists of a table with 4 columns: requirements name (first column in the excel sheet attached to the page), API name (from http://dev.webinos.org/specifications/new/ ), Interface and method name (both from the API itself). The latter only have to be defined if this is possible.
-   If the requirement is not fulfilled by any API, fill out the last 3 columns with a hyphen
-   If it is unclear whether there is an API, interface or method, use a question mark.
-   If youâ€™re unsure about the API, append the API name with a question mark.
-   A requirement can be fulfilled by more then one API, feel free to add multiple lines for a requirement.
