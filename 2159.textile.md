Discovery
=========

Discovery means different things in different context. The aim of discovery is to support devices to connect each other to create a personal zone.

Different kinds of discovery handled in this specification:
* Device Discovery:
**** Finding devices which are in near proximity or local devices. Devices that can be searched using home networking protocols, short range bearers and local bearers are covered in this section.
**** Connecting to pre-known address i.e. PZH URL. There is no discovery mechanism involved here, but part of connecting to other device in a personal network.
* Service Discovery: Finding a webinos capable services. They could be found either via PZH or via Peer. These services are discoverable once device are connected. If not connected service discovery is local to a current device.
* User Discovery: Search users URL to enable connecting them. This can be either using WebFinger or by searching OpenId URL.

Device discovery
----------------

Device discovery involves searching for devices to connect. The discovery mechanism is applicable in peer to peer connection. The mechanism to device which are remote is via PZH and does not involve any discovery.

Webinos does not intend to introduce new device discovery mechanism but provide a platform to use existing discovery mechanisms.

Different discovery mechanism in Webinos to enable finding local devices:

### Home Networking Protocols:

#### ZeroConf:

ZeroConf provides a mechanism to search local devices in the network. It involves device that intend to be searchable and advertise about its available service.

PZP’s can look for ZeroConf service and the outcome is finding devices that matches the service. Finding this service provide the IP address of the system where this service is located. After this search the connection is then established towards TLS Server running on peer PZP. Only devices which has certificate signed from same PZH will be connected to each other, otherwise connection is dropped if certificate is not from same PZH.

In Webinos context, ZeroConf advertisement is to enable only when device is not connected to PZH or if any existing peer to peer connection is lost. This is intended to not cause power drainage on battery operated devices.

Please note the service provided by ZeroConf is not similar to Webinos Service.

#### UPnP

### Short Range Communication:

#### Bluetooth

Webinos platform, please note

Bluetooth acts as a

#### WiFi Direct

Webinos service discovery
-------------------------

Webinos Service is a functionality which can be discovered and executed on a PZP. This service supports a set of APIs that allow connecting devices to access them. The service communication between devices is done over top of JSON-RPC. The invoking device acts as client and receiving device acts as a server endpoint for executing RPC calls.

Webinos service model is based on certain device might not be capable of providing a service, such as camera. It can make use of service on another device to access its camera. The camera that’s accessible is still running on another device but functionality is invoked from other device.

Service discovery has its lifecyle and require each service to perform following steps to be discoverable and accessible:

-   Loading of service
-   Registration of service at PZP
-   Discovering a service
-   Binding service
-   API access

Please note services cannot be performed on devices that are not connected.

User discovery

A section on T3.5 specifies about using web finger for finding different users.
