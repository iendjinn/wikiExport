Summary
-------

-   Scope
    -   Still discussion on the actual scope. (i.e. during the Turin meeting we included the adaptation of multimedia resources, as well as the user interface and possibly even application logic)
    -   Huge scope. Do we need to prioritize first?
    -   This group only addresses the adaptation. It will rely on an interface with the Context Management group for contextual data.
    -   All partners please propose/negotiate changes to the initial scope. Results will be presented during the next general WP3 call.
-   State of the art
    -   We have a wiki page for relevant state of the art information: [[Context_driven_adaptation]]
    -   IBBT will provide input on related projects and academic research.
    -   Volantis will try to add relevant existing technology
-   Resources
    -   Contributors (according to the Turin meeting minutes): Ambiesense, IBBT, NTUA, Volantis, W3C.
    -   NTUA will mainly act as an interface with the Context Management group. George will check scoping of CM group with Nick/Christian.
    -   Volantis and IBBT will also check available resources.
