WP31 Mirror PrivilegedApps
==========================

This reflections came from "privileged application T3.1 sub task":http://dev.webinos.org/redmine/projects/wp3-1/wiki/%27Privileged_applications%27

Initial threat analysis
-----------------------

"restricted APIs access control point" could (likely) be the PEP. A different term is used until would be defined if privileged APIs need a different mechanisms for access control or, on the contrary, can use (as likely will be) the same policy architecture suitable for unprivileged applications.

If privileged applications would be managed by the same policy architecture and standard policy workflow, many of the threats would be in common with "policy ones":http://dev.webinos.org/redmine/projects/t3-5/wiki/WP31_Mirror_PolicyManagement
