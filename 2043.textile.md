How are devices identified?
---------------------------

Devices are identified _internally_ through their public key. This public key has a certificate containing their friendly name?

Devices are identified _by users_ through their friendly name. The webinos PZP and PZH can translate friendly names into identifiers

How are users identified?
-------------------------

Users are identified in several different ways internally and externally.

### Internally: in policies and preferences

Users are identified by their PZH URL, which is strongly connected to their master PZH public key
Where no such connection can be established (e.g. they do not have a valid SSL certificate), then the PZH public key is the identifier.

### Externally: displayed to other users, used to register a new personal zone hub.

User identity is established through their email address connected to the OpenID account they used to establish the personal zone.

However, as there is no direct look-up provided from OpenID account to webinos personal zone, webinos will also allow the PZH URL to be used as an identifier.

Thereâ€™s a confusion between identity and address here.
