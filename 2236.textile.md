Vehicle API
-----------

### Overview of API

Link to API - http://dev.webinos.org/specifications/new/vehicle.html

The API provides read access to vehicle specific data.

### Threats

#### API-Specific threats and misuse cases

1.  The API could be used to generate driving profiles of a user based on the trip computer data. this might be wanted by targeted advertisers trying to profile the user to send them product advertisements.
2.  The API could be used to monitor the state of the vehicle (e.g. enginge-oil status and trip computer).
3.  Inferring the location of the end user, based on vehicle data

#### Threats based on remote invocation of this API from another device

1.  Vehicle properties with high update frequencies can slow down the communciation within the personal zone.

#### Implementation threats and possible attacks

1.  One implementation of the Vehilce API has access to the MOST-Bus. Depending of the vehicle property the update frequency is short (a few ms). Registering listeners to more high frequency properties can crash the PZP.
2.  Updates on a high frequency properties can freeze the GUI

#### Threats to apps and developers using this API (E.g. Jimmy and Jessica)

1.  Binding to too many vehicle properties can lead to unresponsiveness of the app, as the communication channel between PZP and browser is flooded with RPC messages of the API . The updates can also freeze the GUI of the application for a few seconds.

#### Threats to device manufacturers, operators, other stakeholders

1.  bad publicity for device manufactures, especially as the car is still perceived as one system. Currently customers still do not distinguish between a problem with the engine or with a third application running on in-car headunit. It is perceived as a problem with the car.

### Mitigations

1.  Provide examples for the correct scenarios in which the API should be used.
2.  Use thresholds for updates on high frequency vehicle properties
3.  Limit the amount of vehicle properties an application can register listeners to.
4.  Suggest that manufacturers consider only allowing signed apps from known authors or distributors to access this API

### Recommended default policy rules for applications

The following ‘types’ of application are supported in webinos: [[Types of Application]]. This table provides a summary:

  ------------- ------------------------------------------------------
  _.Code   _.Type
  B-A           Browser-based, authenticated via TLS certificates
  W-R           Widget, authenticated using a recognised certificate
  W-U           Widget, unrecognised
  ------------- ------------------------------------------------------

For each application type, select one of these as the default policy for this API. This applies to an application which explicitly requests access to this API.

  _.B-A   _.W-R   _.W-U   _.Policy                       _.Explanation (Widgets)                                                                                                                             _.Explanation (Browser Apps)                                                                                                      Silently allow                        2. Applications will be granted access to this API without user consent being required. This can only be modified using a policy editor.
  X                                      Default allow (install time)        Widgets will need user consent at install time, but users will expect to allow it (the tick-box will automatically be filled in).                        Web pages will prompt for consent (Yes / No / Always) at runtime, this preference will be saved.
               X                         Default ask at runtime (one-shot)   Widgets will require one-off user consent at runtime. This fact will be visible & modifiable at install time.                                            Web pages will prompt for consent (Yes / No / Always) at runtime, this preference will be saved.                                       Default ask at runtime (every time)   Widgets will require user consent at runtime, every time. This fact will be visible & modifiable at install time.
                            X            Default deny (install time)         Widgets will require user consent at install time, but users will expect NOT to allow it (the tick-box will automatically be empty).                     Web pages will display a short notification at first-use saying that access was denied, with a button to change settings
                                         Silently deny                       2. Applications will not be granted access to this API, and users will not be asked at install time. This can only be modified using a policy editor.
