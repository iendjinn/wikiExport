20110502 conf call on User Identity Management
==============================================

Date: 2 May 2011
Time: 11:00 - 12:00 CEDT
Bridge: PowWowNow, _Enhanced Access_, PIN: 312806, "Dial-in numbers":http://pdf.powwownow.com/pdf/GBR_en_pwn-dial-in-numbers.pdf

Agenda:
* Discussion of newly created and updated sequence diagrams and activity diagrams

Action Items:
* All: Review new sequence diagram for Use Cases scenario 3
* All: discuss with Nick, Dave, John to foster details already on the first day of Berlin meeting
* All: investigate on the most usable technologies for user auth on the Web (likely to be OAuth, JSON WebToken, JSON WebSignature)

Attendees:
* Steffen
* Christian Schaefer
* Sven
* Andrea

Discussion:
* Andrea: currently proposed architecture (with PZP and PZH) is more flexible than the previous idea with a centralised entity. From security perspective it is worse as credentials are stored in all devices. If we go for it we favour usability over security.
* Steffen: reliability problem compared to centralised approach: tokens cannot be revoked in offline cases
* Sven: should not be an issues as we have IDP on the public Internet
* Steffen: how does in the inter-zone communication user authentication work when users do not see each other physically?
* Sven: different strengths of auth in inter-zone communication and in Internet-communication:
**** social proximity-based in inter-zone communication
**** certificate/token/public key-based on the Internet, supported by the IDP
* Steffen: we should not differentiate too much
* Steffen: on profiling: as long as we have reliable IDP where trust is strong, we can work with profiles like in Facebook (what are friends, family, strangers allowed to access). In the offline case I cannot make sure reliably to talk to the right person. Therefore profiles can be adjusted so that access to sensitive data is denied for other users in the offline case. In other words: some access is only possible in online case.
* Sven: user is either online and has access to IDP or user is offline where there is typically geographic proximity (e.g. for sharing media content when meeting)
* Steffen: does access to my friend’s WIFI imply access to his services = does this authenticate me? Should be limited to access rights the user explicitly wants to assign
* Sven: should be defined by the policy. Access can be short term or long term. Defined by the user who grants access, granted by shared keys among the two users.

-   Andrea: new sequence diagrams under [[Use_Cases|Use Cases]] in scenarios 3 and 5; simple but useful to make sure we have the same understanding
-   We discuss the diagram of scenario 5 here
-   Andrea: PZH forwards auth requests to an IDP if needed in a way transparent to the user
-   Andrea: details of auth depend on what kind of auth is used (passwd, challenge based on pre-shared keys, …). Assumes that there is a pre-shared key between the two users
-   Two-way auth: first user --> device, then device to anything else (e.g. device of another user)
-   Each PZP has to cache all the data from the PZH
    -   Andrea: risky as credentia’s security is the security of the weakest device
    -   Sven: minimum requirements for how to store and handle credentials
    -   Andrea: if a device does not fulfil these requirements, the device cannot cache data for the offline case. The PZP on this device would then have no access to this data
-   Andrea: diagram of scenario 3 should be reviewed by all for the Berlin meeting. It illustrates in a more complex scenario what communication can happen
-   Christian: choice of protocols: authentication on the Web, OAuth, JSON WebToken, JSON WebSignature are used for defining and transporting tokens and performing auth
-   Andrea: OAuth should be suitable but further investigations are required; would be a suitable choice
    -   Christian: the most suitable choice
    -   service provision in scenario 5 is a perfect use case for OAuth
-   next step: have a closer look on these technologies

-   Berlin meeting
    -   need to discuss with Nick, Dave, John to foster details already on the first day

Next meeting: face-to-face meeting in Berlin, May 3-5
