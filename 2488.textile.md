Attack Resistance Analysis
--------------------------

The security concerns which formed the basis of the attack resistance analysis were initially drawn from the misuse cases in D2.8. However, these were also supplemented by several additional security concerns which had been identified by the project in the last year. These concerns were used to populate 16 contextualised patterns.

The definitions for the attack patterns and their supplemental obstacle models can be found in the appendix, but these patterns — and the leaf obstacles arising from them — are summarised in the table below.
