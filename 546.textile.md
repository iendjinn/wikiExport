Use Cases
=========

To help contextualise some of the technical detail, some high level use cases will be outlined, annotated with the technical points of interest.

These are intended to form concrete scenarios that we can use to test the architectural concepts we will develop and the assumption will be that these will be some of the first applications we will prototype and test.

Media consumption use case
--------------------------

The first set of use cases relate to the consumption of music and videos across multiple devices. Peter and George have music and videos they want to watch and play

This media is spread across mobile phones, PCs, web servers, set-top boxes and in car audio devices.

The target is for Peter and George to consume their own and each others media, on any device, in an easy to user way, but retaining security.

We will go through some specific scenarios below, and for each, try to identify the key **issues** that need reconciling with the architecture.

### Critical questions to be answered

-   When does identity attestation happen
    -   Does the application request it - or does the runtime itself, requirest it. Or is it triggered when the policy needs to know the user requesting.
-   Can the runtime cache identity attestatiion
    -   If one application has checked who the user is, will the runtime remember it, so that another application does not have to reattest
-   Can/will different servers

### Dimensions to be considered

The six scenarios below explore combinations across three different dimensions

1.  Attesting a user, using and online ID server and in the offline case
2.  Attestting users as they are about to share resources
3.  A remote service that has to attest a user

### Scenario 1 - George wants to view his mobile hosted MP4s on his set top box and both devices have access to the internet

Assumptions

-   George **owns** both devices
-   George is going to trigger and control the playback from his mobile device
-   The Settop box therefore acts as a slave, and exposes (remotely) stop, playback ffwd, rwd, and status functions
-   The data will be streamed from mobile to set top box
-   We will assume both devices have access to the public internet

ISSUE IDENTITY - When is the user identified?
* Does the application request it - requre the user to logon
* Or does the runtime itself, require it
* Or is it triggered when the policy needs to know the user requesting
* If the device has already "identified the user* by a pin for example - can the framework, reuse any of this information

_Dave: it is just an **assumption** that the user **has** to be identified in the above scenario. Another model would be to peer the devices, and surface the set top box in the mobile UI as a target for the music playback. The peering doesn’t necessitate identifying the user. The music on the mobile may have some digital rights limitations, but this is a matter of the coupling of the music and its license._

ISSUE DISCOVERY- How do the devices find each other?

Option A

If both devices are on the public internet, we can assume that could both have visibility of a pre-existing "sharing and control" service.
This is similar to how logmein or gotomypc work. Both devices could in theory have long lasting sessions with this server, and login with the same credentials.
It is simply then a question of "tallying" the that two sessions exist, and mapping the devices.

The problem with this approach is that it is proprietary, therefore every application is in essence owned by the central server.

Option B

We define a common **authentication protocol**, and the user can chose a **sharing service** of their own choice (as they will all support the same protocol). This separates the application from the service, and allows the ecosystem to scale.

This gets us to the stage where two **sessions owned by one user** exist on the

Option C (added by Sven)

All the devices which are owned by the same user share a common secret which is used to authenticate each other. Thus devices of this user can arbitrarily set-up sessions at any time without involvement of a service.

Yet to be solved in option C:
* How is the shared secret rolled out (initial registration of devices)?
* Who maintains the list of the devices of the user which tells us which devices should get this secret? All the devices on their own? A service?

Option D (added by Sven)

A mixture of Option B and Option C where there is a service involved for discovery and maintaining the list of devices belonging to the same user, but where shared secrets are used for devices belonging to the same user and the service is used when communicating to other users. This would also ease discovery, as there would be a publicly accessible mapping between users and their devices.

ISSUE -

_Dave: the mobile could search for the set top box via WiFi and mDNS (or similar) or via Bluetooth. If neither device is locally connected, a further possibility is via a social web site that keeps track of what devices you own and their context (Personal Zone and social proximity)._

#### Proposed sequence of interactions

#### Possible Implementation

Dave: the simplest ideas are often the best. George’s phone discovers the set top box as a media player and adds it to the menu for media playback to his mobile media playing app. The devices are peered either one to one or as part of George’s personal zone. This enables the mobile app to access the service exposed by the set top box. This would work with either WiFi or Bluetooth.

### Scenario 2 - George wants to view his mobile hosted MP4s on his set top box and neither of the devices have access to the internet

Assumptions
* Much as scenario 1 - the critical difference is that neither of the device can make use of an open hosted identity server

#### Proposed sequence of interactions

Accordingly to the proposed User ID and policy management architecture, a [[Scenario2Sequence|draft of interaction diagram]] is detailed for comments

#

Dave: same as above, but obviously, the public server isn’t involved, so we are limited to local discovery and peering mechanisms. Note that once the devices are peered, they can authenticate each other automatically, the next time George is in this scenario.

### Scenario 3 - George wants to listet to Pauls MP4s on his mobile - mobile to mobile, and both have access to the internet

Assumptions
* There is access to open identity servers on the internet
* This is a sharing scenario: permission must be granted for a resource to be consumed by another person
* This requires both users identity to be attested

#### Proposed sequence of interactions

Accordingly to the proposed User ID and policy management architecture, a [[Scenario3Sequence|draft of interaction diagram]] is detailed for comments

And another one considering the PZH and PZP entities [[Scenario3SequencePZH|draft of interaction diagram]] is detailed for comments

#### Possible Implementation

#
#
#
#

Dave: George’s phone could discover Paul’s mobile, e.g. via Bluetooth or WiFi. Alternatively, the phone number of the mobile could be used as a basis for wide area discovery via a mapping from phone numbers to URLs. This gets us back to personal zones and social proximity. Your mobile number could even be used as a public key as a basis for authentication.

### Scenario 4 - George wants to listet to Pauls MP4s on his mobile - mobile to mobile, and neither have access to the internet

#### Proposed sequence of interactions

Accordingly to the proposed User ID and policy management architecture, a [[Scenario4Sequence|draft of interaction diagram]] is detailed for comments

#### Possible Implementation

#
#
#
#

Dave: as earlier. George’s mobile discovers Paul’s or vice versa, and a peering then takes place. This essentially involves social trust mechanism that allows Paul and George to be assured it is their phones and not evil Sue.

### Scenario 5 - George has music hosted on a web service, and wants to listen to them on his own mobile device

#### Proposed sequence of interactions

Accordingly to the proposed User ID and policy management architecture, a [[Scenario5Sequence|draft of interaction diagram]] is detailed for comments

And another one considering the PZH and PZP entities [[Scenario5SequencePZH|draft of interaction diagram]] is detailed for comments

#### Possible Implementation

#
#
#
#

George’s phone authenticates to his account with the music site. This is same as Firefox account manager where the website publishes a proof specification and account management API. The browser can set up an account on George’s behalf, and sync this across George’s personal zone.

### Scenario 6 - George has music hosted on a web service, and wants to listen to them on his Pauls mobile device

#### Proposed sequence of interactions

Accordingly to the proposed User ID and policy management architecture, a [[Scenario6Sequence|draft of interaction diagram]] is detailed for comments

#### Possible Implementation

#
#
#
#

Dave: as for previous example, but requiring an OAuth like policy mechanism to enable the web site to provide access to George’s "friends".

### Scenario 7 - George has two different hosted web services that host music - he is playing a playlist which interleave tracks from both services

ISSUE IDENTITY - How often does the users ID need to be attested
* Here we have two web services that will need to authenticate the user - will they both do the authentication
**** will one trust anothers attempt
**** will boht trust a central service

ISSUE IDENTITY - Can identity be cached
* If the first web service, requested ther user be identified, can the client compoent cached the results of the ID attestation - and will this be trusted by the second service

ISSUE POLICY - Where will a web service cache the fact that a user is granted access to a service

#### Proposed sequence of interactions

#### Possible Implementation

#

### Scenarion 8 - George wants to listen to music stored on his mobile, through the set-top box - but this time using the set-top box as the controller

Assumptions

-   The application on the settop box is the primary user interface
-   The mobile is a _dumb_ data store, exposing its information through are remotely accessibile gallery API
-   The settop box is a shared device (he lives in a student shared flat) therefore George does not "own" both devices

Single Sign-On
--------------

webinos makes use of single sign-on (SSO) in order to only authenticate the user once. The user can either be authenticated by webinos or by another service outside webinos.

### Scenario 9 - Gloria is already logged-in to Facebook while accessing a hosted webinos music service

Assumption

-   The user is already authenticated to their mobile device and to Facebook
-   The user opens a webinos application or accesses a webinos service where user authentication is required
-   Due to SSO webinos can authenticate the user by using Facebook without asking the user for credentials again
-   When the webinos application calls the login API, the user’s device detects that the Facebook authentication is present and that there is no need to authenticate the user again; the Facebook authentication is used to create a webinos token which is used within webinos for authentication

Gloria is authenticated via Facebook. webinos makes an authorisation request to Facebook in order to verify Gloria’s authentication. If verification succeeds, a token is created which is used to authenticate Gloria at the music service.

Setting and communication behaviour in this scenario is like in Scenario 5.

ISSUE IMPLEMENTATION: how does the webinos runtime or the browser on Gloria’s device know that she already logged in to Facebook? If she just uses her browser for Facebook, there is a session between the browser and Facebook. But how could webinos know about this session and use it for the authorisation request?
