Service Discovery
=================

1. Introduction
---------------

Webinos discovery defines programming interfaces to discover services on local or other devices or servers, in- and out-side a Personal Zone, automatically or on demand. It is responsible for:
â€¢ querying or finding services based on certain criteria
â€¢ binding with WRT the services that were discovered

To be discovered a service must be registered in the Personal Zone of a user. A service can reside either in the Person Zone where the service discovery is initiated or in another Personal Zone. Webinos provides application developers with a unified JavaScript API for service discovery. It is invoked when any service is required. E.g. if the application needs a geolocation service, a service discovery can be initiated to get it. Webinos discovery should be able to handle both webinos services and non-webinos services. Service discovery itself is a fundamental built-in webinos service.

Service discovery is carried out in two scopes: intra-Personal Zone discovery (or intra-Zone discovery in short) and inter-Personal Zone discovery (or inter-Zone discovery in short). An implementation should implement both discovery mechanisms. For intra-Zone discovery the user discovers available services on all PZPs in the Personal Zone. For inter-Zone discovery the user discovers available services in other Personal Zones securely, as access control policies permit.

This document specifies how to discover services with webinos core functions. The foundations for service discovery include the webinos service concept, RPC and service registry.

2. Discovery mechanism description
----------------------------------

Webinos services are registered with PZPs. When service discovery is invoked, the search takes place on the PZP. The search is based on certain criteria, which is either represented by a service type or just a wildcard. If there are any services meeting the search criteria the results are returned and the user can then bind the service with the WRT. A PZP may work in hub mode or peer mode when it carries out a service discovery. In hub mode, the search is assisted by the PZH. In peer mode, the search is carried out by peer queries directly to other known PZPs, which are found by PZP discovery [PZP].

### 2.1. Intra-Zone service discovery

Services available inside a Personal Zone must register themselves with the PZP where they are provided. A service can be invoked from a WRT in use. The service then is found at the affiliated PZP through RPC. The webinos WRT provides a RPC method for invoking service discovery. The discovery call then is sent to the PZP where the service searching is executed. If the searching hits some record on the PZP service registry the results are returned. At the same time a RCP call to PZP is initiated.

If the RPC call is executed on the PZP, the PZP searches the local service registry for the requested service. If the service is found the result is returned to the invoking WRT. Otherwise, the PZP will invoke a search on the PZH on behalf of the invoking WRT. In that case, the PZH searches Personal Zone service registry for the requested service. If found the result is returned to the WRT directly. The procedure is depicted in Figure 1.

Figure 1: Intra-Zone service discovery

The example in the figure shows how a service â€œweibinos.org/api/applauncherâ€ is discovered. From the WRT the query is sent out with RPC. The PZP handling the service query then search its local service registry and find no such service. Then it relays the query to the PZH. Or, if it found the service the result would be returned to the WRT directly. The query for services is then sent to the PZH, where the PZH will further look up for the demanded services. For the example there is an entry of the requested service. The PZH returns the results directly to the calling PZP.

Figures 2 and 3 show respectively the local service registry on PZP, and the Personal Zone service registry on PZH.

### 2.2. Inter-Zone service discovery

The inter-Zone discovery consists of two steps:
Step 1: Discover PZHs;
Step 2: Discover services from the found PZHs, which is a secured service registry lookup on remote PZHs.

Step 1 is specified in [PZH] and not elaborated here. In Step 2, each found remote PZH immediately conducts a local service lookup and returns the results to the calling PZP, if demanded services are found. If no service meets the searching criteria, the RPC just finishes silently.

Figure 4: Inter-Zone service discovery

Figure 4 shows an example of inter-Zone service discovery. Step 1 local discovery is omitted and step 2 is shown. After Alice initiates inter-Zone discovery her PZH finds a couple of other PZHs. The RPC findServices is invoked on the found three PZHs. Among those Peterâ€™s PZH hasnâ€™t found any services meeting the search criteria within his personal zone. Bob and Charlieâ€™s PZHs return search results directly to Aliceâ€™s PZP.

### 2.3. Integrated service discovery sequence diagram

Figure 5 is the sequenced diagram for service discovery, depicting both intra- and inter-Zone scenarios. The hub mode and peer mode are alternatives to each other. For the inter-Zone discovery, the RPC findServices to other PZHs are asynchronous and thus can be executed in parallel in implementation.

3. Session layer message format
-------------------------------

The service discovery messaging is based on messaging specified in [CORE]. The Service Discovery API relies on messages that are sent on the session layer level to exchange information about registeres services between the PZH and connected PZPs. For different implementations to be compatible these messages must be supported. The general session layer message format is the following:
<pre>
{
 "to" : to, // the receiver
 "from" : from, // the sender
 "type" : "prop", // must be "prop"
 "payload" : {
 "status" : "", // a string defining the message type, see below
 "message" : {} // the body depending on status
 }
}
</pre>

The Service Discovery uses three types of messages of that format. The following specifies how the _payload_ property of the above object should be formatted for each of them.

#### registerServices

This message is used by a PZP to inform the PZH of its own registered services. It is used initially when the PZP connects to the PZH and every time there is a change in the registered services with the PZP.
<pre>
{
 "status" : "registerServices",
 "message" : {
 services : [], // an array of service objects according to the Service interface from the Service Discovery API specification
 from: "" // a string representing the PZP id
 }
}
</pre>

#### findServices

This message is a challenge sent every time a PZP asks a PZH or PZP for their services. The receiver of this message should then reply with the `foundServices` message specified below.

<pre>
{
 "status" : "findServices",
 "message" : {
 id: "" // an id that must be echoed in the reply (foundServices, see below) to identify the callback
 }
}
</pre>

#### foundServices

This message is sent as reply to the `findServices` message and includes all services from the sender.

<pre>
{
 "status" : "foundServices",
 "message" : [] // an array of service objects according to the Service interface from the Service Discovery API specification
 "message.id" : "" // the same id that was received from the findServices message that triggered this message as response
 }
}
</pre>

4. JavaScript API
-----------------

Webinos provides web developers with a JavaScript API to discover services. It is part of webinos Discovery API. The user can use different parameter combinations to define different specific application discovery usage. The API is specified in Deliverable D3.4, webinos API specification. The method is:
 findServices(â€¦).

5. Service discovery with Web Intents
-------------------------------------

This sub-section is informative and reflects the investigation of Web Intents in the context of webinos at the time of writing. More details can be found in the Web Intents for webinos part in [WOS34]. Web Intents is a service discovery mechanism and light-weight RPC system between web applications, modeled after the similarly-named API in Android. Standardization is in progress and W3C runs a joint DAP WG / Web Applications WG task force.

-   "W3C Web Intents specification":http://www.w3.org/TR/web-intents/

Web Intents was originally designed to allow Web applications to access services provided by other Web applications with the browser acting as a broker that binds the service request to the service provider according to the user’s preferences. More recently, there have been proposals for applying Web Intents to services provided by devices on the local area network or on the same device as the browser. See:

-   "SonyMobile - Local Network Service Discovery":http://www.w3.org/wiki/WebIntents/SonyMobile_-_Local_Network_Service_Discovery
    
    The details of the Web Intents specification are still evolving. Service providers can advertise themselves via markup on a page that is visited by the browser (or potentially by a search engine). Suggestions have also been made for using a JavaScript API for service registration. In both cases the browser acts as the broker. This remains the case for local network service discovery where the browser is capable of registering services discovered via approaches such as ZeroConf and UPnP. Browser sync is now well established, e.g. on browsers such as Firefox and chrome, and used to provide users with access to their bookmarks, browser preferences etc. on different machines. In principle, this could be extended to include the Web Intents registry. Note that browser sync is currently proprietary, i.e. it only works with the same kind of browser on each device.
    
    A reasonable way of extending webinos to support Web Intents would be to host the registry on the PZP or the PZH. The latter is more challenging as it would involve the use of an overlay network to access services on different devices when they are not on the same local network. The existing webinos service discovery solution is restricted to webinos services. Web Intents would expand this to include non-webinos services. Further work is needed to explore the impact on the webinos implementation.
