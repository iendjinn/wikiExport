Local API guidelines (in preparation for 32)
============================================

Webinos APIs are going to be led by different companies and created by different people. It is very important all the Webinos APIs adhere to a set of common patterns and best practices so that:

-   All Webinos can be used in the same way by developers.
-   Duplication of work is avoided.
-   Webinos looks like a unique project rather than as the aggregation of different ones.

In order to achieve this consistency, it is very important the tools used by all the authors are the same. A set of guidelines are needed such as:

* Which methods should be made asynchronous and which ones should be synchronous. E.g. lengthy operations, security sensitive onesâ€¦
* Which is the pattern for asynchronous calls:
# listeners, one callback, multiple callbacks.
# Order of the callbacks.
# Are all the callbacks mandatory? Are error callbacks always optional?
# Can a success callback be invoked many times? e.g. what happens if a message is sent to multiple recipients?

* Filtering: Different APIs may need data filtering, a common pattern should be defined for them.
* Data exposed: Should APIs try to expose as much data as possible or should they try to focus on the less common denominator?
* Error Handling:
# How should we specify errors, unique Error interface or distributed in every module? how do we handle error codes and error code collision?
# Can asynchronous methods throw errors? If so, under which circumstances?
# What is a valid type? (Note that ES is a very loosely typed language), what is a valid argument?

All these questions are not new and have been already raised/discussed in other fora, however it is important we try to answer them as soon as possible so we can start specifying APIs based on some assumptions.

I already created some guidelines for WAC, see: http://specs.wacapps.net/wac2_0/feb2011/deviceapis/patterns.html. We can use them as starting point for this discussion.
