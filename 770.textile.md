Further Security and Privacy Guidelines
=======================================

Developer Guidelines
--------------------

Web application security is a complex topic with various facets; contending with this is a challenge for secure software development. Secure software development is a holistic approach to securing the software development life cycle with structured analyses and decision for security issues. Secure software development processes start by defining business goals, from which deriving assets, and business and technical risks are derived. These prerequisites allow for the definition of security requirements; these requirements form the basis of security design. The design phase is as relevant as the implementation phase from security perspective. Both phases need to be adequately carried out to avoid vulnerabilities. The right design prevents design flaws, and a correct and defensive implementation prevents implementation bugs. Such flaws lead to vulnerabilities, which are an avenue of unauthorised access for attackers to exploit assets.

Secure software development is just one part of the security design. In order to secure the assets of a web application, the collection of web application, web server, web browser and the communication links between them also need to be secured according to the security requirements. This covers not only development but also operation of applications. Consequently, the hosting environment needs to provide certain security features as well. To support these activities, the security community has established a number of best practices. This section briefly provides some of this guidance.

### Design and Implementation of the web application

Both designers and developers need to be aware of secure software development. It is essential that they are trained to watch out for security issues during their work. This kind of training is a process. It is neither done by a one day workshop nor is it done by deploying a particular security tool. Having the broad and deep overview is essential. Best results are achieved if there are well experienced security experts in the team. Security ought to be driven by multiple people. Discussions are important to not accidently miss important security issues.

As mentioned earlier, secure software development starts by identifying business goals, deriving business risks, deriving technical risks, assets and security requirements. This is a complex task which requires long years of experience. This is why it is important to have security experts in the team.

When it comes to the design it is important to keep track on the assets. Answers to questions, such as: â€œWhere are the assets situated?â€, â€œHow are the assets accessed?â€, â€œAre they transferred between entities?â€, â€œWhich way are they transferred?â€ and many more are to be found. These answers help understanding by which entry points the assets can be accessed. This then helps to understand which security measures are to be applied to prevent unauthorised access. Systematic analyses which are called Threat Modelling or Threat Analysis exist in order to perform these complex analyses in a comprehensible and structured way. A well experienced organisation has refined these analyses to integrate them in their SDLC. Having extensive databases which contain typical attacks, threats and vulnerabilities supports succeeding in these analyses.

When implementing security functionality of the application, best practice is to reuse as much existing code and concepts as possible. With security protocols, cryptographic algorithms and algorithms for authentication and for setting-up secure communication channels, it is easy to miss important details and to implement them in an insecure way. Well established algorithms and implementations which have been used and tested for several years should be chosen as they have proven to withstand certain attacks.

Web applications expose their input to the network. It is not only the user who can send input to the applicationâ€™s interface. Any unauthorised entity can do as well. Thus one of the most important security issues for implementation is to trust none of the user input provided to the web applications. All input needs to be validated for inacceptable input. This is essential for protection against injection attacks. Invalid input is to be rejected. Due to internationalisation and masking of characters validation of input can be difficult. Coherent validation is essential. web application frameworks typically provide sophisticated APIs which do this job. However, they have to be used in the web application.

Also to prevent injection attacks, use a parameterised API instead of composing a command (e.g. a SQL statement) in a single string. This makes sure that part of the user input cannot be interpreted as commands. This also protects against cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks since user input will not be treated as executable code. It is also best practice to whitelist valid input rather than blacklisting disallowed input. This implementation style mitigates some classes of attacks where escaping is used to bypass the blacklist.

Session management is usually a feature of web applications, and it is important that this is designed correctly. Incorrect session handling facilitates attacks such a session theft, access sensitive resources without the need for a session, and the remote control of sessions from other web applications. Several web application development frameworks (e.g. Java Enterprise Edition) provide frameworks for session management. Using these offloads the burden of developers implementing session management correctly, so these frameworks are encouraged.

Access control is necessary for object access; this includes checking of the existence of a valid session. Access should only be granted if there is a valid session, and access control policy permits access. When referencing objects, it is good practice to use indirect references per user which cannot be guessed by an attacker. This prevents attacks where attackers use direct object references to access without authentication.

To prevent Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks, each request shall contain a unique token which proves the web application that the request indeed belongs to the applicationâ€™s flow of communication. The unique token is not known to an attacker trying to remotely control an open session via another session. Consequently, any message sent by the attacker will not be considered valid by the web application.

Where cryptography is used, cryptographic protocols should be used correctly. In addition to strong algorithms, strong key lengths should be be chosen and correctly implemented in algorithms. Data should also be encrypted as part of a system’s backup strategy, although decryption keys should be stored in a secure location away from the backups. In general, keys and passwords should be protected from any kind of unauthorised access.

Redirects and forwards should be discouraged. If this is not possible, validate all URLs carefully and do not use user input to determine the destination.

### Network architecture â€“ operational considerations

In addition to secure development practices, the environment within which the application is operated is to be set-up securely also needs to be considered. These can be characterised in the guidelines below.

-   Encapsulate different entities, such as web servers, database servers and business logic into different (virtual) machines. This allows network level access control in terms of firewalls and by application layer firewalls.
-   Insert a firewall between the internet and the network hosting the web application. This should only permit the traffic necessary for the web application.
-   Insert a Web Application Firewall (WAF) between the internet and the web server. This is primarily used where vulnerabilities are discovered and an immediate response is required. Until there is a patch available for the web application, certain critical requests can be filtered by the WAF in order not to reach the web server. Alternatively, the WAF checks all input permanently. The latter, however, requires changes on the WAF once the application has changed (e.g. by an update of application).
-   If there is a computationally expensive operation on the web server in the beginning of a communication (e.g. for user authentication), the client should perform a more expensive computation before the server does its computation. This impedes some Denial of Service (DoS) attacks.

Time should also be set aside for hardening all components associated with a web application. In case of a web application, for instance, the web server, the database server, the web application container and maybe more need to be securely configured. For example, default passwords should not be used for administrative accounts, and unnecessary services accessible via the Internet should be disabled; these are often a means for attackers to bypass security mechanisms.

### Secure communication

Because web application encapsulates server and client components, there is continual communication over the network. If this communication is performed in clear text, many entities are potentially able to read and/or modify messages. In many web applications, some of this data might be sensitive. Sensitive data may include everything related to authentication and session management, as well as application data. Since many web applications require sessions (i.e. users to authenticate and to â€œlog inâ€), many web applications require secure communication.

The most common algorithm used in secure web traffic is TLS (Transport Layer Security). This provides authentication of the server, confidentiality of the communication and integrity of the messages. In addition, it optionally provides authentication of the client. TLS utilises public/private key pairs for encryption, decryption, digitally signing and verifying messages. Certificates are used to verify the validity of public key bindings to their origin.

TLS is available to development environment as an API. Many web servers integrate this for free, although, when XMLhttpRequests (XHR) are used, there might be the need for the developer to explicitly set TLS for communication. When using TLS between the user and the service (i.e. the browser and the web application), it is important that certificate used is valid, and, where used, the secure flag is set for all sensitive cookies.

### Runtime environment implementation guidelines

The web runtime environment executes the client part of the application on the client host; this runtime is typically a web browser. For the user, browser security is essential, as a weakly secured browser allows attackers to remote control browser sessions and to break out of the boundaries of the browser and control the host. A browser is analogous to an operating system, as it executes multiple independent applications at the same time.

Security measures which need to be in place are strict isolation of applications, strict separation from the rest of the system, access control, and adopting the same-origin policy.

Isolating applications ensures they cannot influence or control another, and they cannot access other applications’ data. During system design, process isolation features of the underlying operating system are adopted; these ensure only limited functionality is exposed to the application, the behaviour of the application is monitored, and access control to any kind of resource is performed. For example, the isolation concept of Android uses a separate Linux process per application being executed within its own Java runtime environment, where every process is executed under a separate Linux user ID. Here, isolation is implemented from the operating system layer, through the middleware layer, and up to the application layer of the system. Such a concept also ensures that applications have no access to other application’s memory as long as it is not declared shared. It is good practice for developers to avoid using shared memory. Data (or objects) should be passed explicitly in the code though API calls instead. This is a clearer design where it is known at any time of the application’s execution who has access to the data, determined by the life of the object, and by the existence of object references.

Exposing limited functionality to the application is one motivation for using APIs. APIs describe the kind of input expected, and the kind of output they provide. For runtime environment security, it is essential that all the APIs are implemented carefully and only valid input is accepted. APIs need to robust in the face of any kind of attack where invalid input is used to find weak points and break the runtime environment’s security.

Monitoring application behaviour is a suitable tool for enforcing isolation, where each application has its own assigned memory area. If an application is malfunctioning or malicious, it might try to address memory areas outside the assigned area. When monitoring applications, this kind of access can be determined. The application can then either be terminated or the access is redirected to somewhere within the assigned memory area.

Access control is closely related to monitoring. As many of the resources an application may need to access are assets, resources need to be protected from arbitrary access. Access control is one form of monitoring where each attempt to access a resource is checked by a reference monitor. Only if access is permitted, the reference monitor grants access. The decision whether access is permitted is usually made by a Policy Decision Point (PDP) which makes its decision from the security policy. Having a well-maintained, conflict-free and complete security policy is important. A poor security policy is likely to result in weaknesses even though the system might be implemented correctly.

The _same-origin policy_ is implemented in contemporary web browsers. This states that web applications can only load additional code and content from the same origin from which the application was retrieved. This prevents attackers who successfully modify the code of the web application to download code or content from their sources. The developer is strictly advised to make sure that the same-origin policy is implemented.

Many runtime environments are extended by integrating plug-ins. Functionality, this is desirable, but this can be dangerous from security perspective. Plug-ins often need to operate in the core of the runtime environment to perform their tasks. This is why plug-ins typically have privileged access rights. A sound security concept for plug-ins is, therefore, required. Their origin should be known and authenticated, and their integrity should be validated; as such, plug-ins should not be installed without user consent. It is common practice for developers to digitally sign their plug-ins to meet these requirements. This does not prevent malicious plug-ins from being installed and executed, but it does identify the source of the plug-in, and ensures that the application has not been modified. To mitigate the risk of executing malicious plug-ins, developers are strongly recommended to provide plug-in access control, and only permit plug-ins with the access which they really need.

In general, the developer should always be aware that the web runtime environment is a trusted component. If it can be broken by an attacker, the attacker has access to other applications, to resources, or to the underlying system. This unauthorised access gives the attacker a powerful tool at hand to disclose or modify data, to misuse resources, and to remote control the system. This can be prevented by a clear design, by thoroughly implementing the runtime environment, and by only implementing functionality that is really needed. The smaller a trusted component is, the easier it can be tested and validated; this significantly reduces the number of potential undiscovered weaknesses.

### Privacy

Privacy is. in essence, a userâ€™s right to decide what happens with his or her personal information. In many countries, user consent is legally required for processing, using, storing and transmitting personal data. Often this permission is bound to a purpose for which data is used. In some countries a generic consent cannot be requested as this is invalid.

A key feature of todayâ€™s web application is, therefore, to respect usersâ€™ privacy. This can be done by following the following rules.

-   Always tell the user why data is requested, how it will be processed and stored, and who else will gain access to that data. Ask the user for explicit consent.
-   Only acquire, process and transmit data which is really needed to fulfil the respective task.
-   Only store data which is really needed for later access.
-   Do not obscure potential or actual information flow.
-   Make sure that third parties not involved in the task of processing user data, do not have access to the user data.
-   For third parties who are not involved in the task of processing the user data, it shall not be possible to conclude or observe that the user is using the related service. Depending on the environment of the service and the sensitivity of the user data, this implies the need for applying the following measures.
    -   Performing confidential communication by encryption in order to not disclose user data to unauthorised third parties.
    -   Using anonymous or pseudonymous identifiers for users for not allowing third parties to conclude from the data whose data it is.
    -   Authenticating the endpoints of the communication to make sure only legitimate communication partners exchange user data.
-   In cases where the true identity of a user is not required (e.g. for an opinion poll) data shall always be annonymised. There shall be no way to link the data to the user who provided this data. This also includes the organisation who acquire and process the data. Data needs to be acquired accordingly. Additionally, it shall not be possible to conclude relations between data and userâ€™s identity from log or auditing information.

Different regulations apply depending on the purpose of processing the data and the countries where the data is processed. Therefore, the developer should refer to the respective data protection laws.

Taking usersâ€™ privacy seriously raises userâ€™s trust in the service and the organisations providing it.

Cloud Security Models
---------------------

Webinos model of distributed service takes shape of a cloud, that can be composed by user personal devices, and/or third party services. In particular, the PZH is a component that must always provide on-demand service to device component of a personal zone, and according to the actual webinos architecture, its location is typically on the cloud. Also PZPs belonging to the same zone can be remote maintaining membership of the zone, leveraging on cloud-like communication. Due to this organiozation of the webinos network model, it is relevant analyze current most successful cloud solutions and known threats, to ensure webinos components will not suffer of already discovered cloud’s vulnerabilities.

### Relevant Cloud Security Models

Cloud computing refers to the on-demand provision of computational resources (data, software) via a computer network, rather than from a local computer. ([[Deliverable_References#CloudSecMather2009|CloudSecMather2009]], [[Deliverable_References#CloudCompRittinghouse2010|CloudCompRittinghouse2010]])

#### Cloud provisioning models

These take the shape of different provisioning models:

-   â€œSoftware as a serviceâ€ (SaaS, the customer does not purchase software, but rather rents it for use on a subscription or pay-per-use model),
-   â€œPlatform as a serviceâ€ (PaaS, the vendor offers a development environment to application developers, who develop applications and offer those services through the providerâ€™s platform),
-   â€œInfrastructure as a serviceâ€ (IaaS, the vendor provides the infrastructure to run the applications, but the cloud computing approach makes it possible to offer a pay-per- use model and to scale the service depending on demand),
-   less common models like â€œCommunication as a serviceâ€ (a subtype of Software-as-a-Service model, where providers are responsible for the management of hardware and software, e.g. VoIP, instant messaging), and
-   â€œSecurity as a serviceâ€ (the vendor offer security functionalities like e-mail and web content filtering, vulnerability management, etc).

#### Cloud security

Security concerns about cloud computing approach a mixed set of new and old-fashioned threats, targeting software bugs and exploiting social engineering, involving network security and access controls.
Different aspects must be carefully detailed and considered: the infrastructure must be approached through a security-wise approach in all its components. This means addressing security at network level, at host level, and at application level. Sensitive data must be adequately secured to avoid confidentiality and integrity breaches. To enable a proper access control, accountability identity and access management must be designed in order to achieve efficient procedures, mitigate complexity, improve user experience, and reduce errors and insecure shortcuts.

##### Cloud security - network

A cloud system exposes significant risk-factors at network level. Like all network-based services, data in transit to and from the cloud providers suffer of confidentiality and integrity problem due to malicious agents along the path. Access to resources can also be problematic when cloud providers do not sufficiently adopt â€œIP revocation mechanismsâ€ when no longer needed for one customer. Because of this, customer canâ€™t assume that network access to their resources is terminated upon release of its IP address, thereby exposing resources to unauthorized access.

Cloud system must also guarantee high availability. BGP hijacking can affect the availability of cloud-based resources, while the use of external DNS querying exposes clouds to external DoS attacks which expos resources, and by internal DoS attacks by rogue users who exploit cloud access to launch attacks on other cloud users.

Clouds also imply new and different boundaries. The established model of network zones and domains is replaced with less precise and firm â€œsecurity groupsâ€, â€œsecurity domainsâ€ or â€œvirtual data centersâ€. Conceptually, this allows separation between tiers, but these need to be properly understood if security breaches and improper use is to be avoid.

Network security hardening is necessary to avoid common network attacks. For example, confidentiality and integrity can be assured by appropriate encryption and digital signature, network filters (e.g., firewall) should be shaped and managed by cloud providers. For sake of accountability and forensics, provider-managed aggregation of security event logs is desirable, and to timely address ongoing problems, network-based intrusion detection system/intrusion prevention system is useful.

##### Cloud security - host level

Although there are few new host level security threats and vulnerabilities, some are inherited from related environments, e.g. some virtualization security threats carry into the public cloud computing environment. Even if the threats are not conceptually new, cloud computing harnesses the power of thousands of compute nodes, combined with the homogeneity of the operating system employed by hosts. This means the threats can be amplified quickly and easily.

Based on the cloud model adopted, slightly different requirements are implied.

In SaaS and PaaS, host security is opaque to customers. The responsibility of securing the hosts is relegated to the CSP (Cloud Service Provider), who institutes the necessary security controls. These include restricting physical and logical access to hypervisor and other forms of employed virtualisation layers.

In IaaS cloud model, the CSP has to secure the virtualization layer of software between the hardware and the virtual servers. A vulnerable hypervisor could expose all user domains to malicious insiders and hypervisors are potentially susceptible to subversion attacks. The customer guest OS (or virtual server) is also a point of interest. This is the virtual instance of an operating system provisioned on top of the virtualization layer that customers have full access to. Since the virtual server may be accessible to anyone on the Internet, access mitigation steps should be taken to restrict access to virtual instances. Possible threats and vulnerabilities include:

-   stealing keys used to access and manage hosts,
-   unpatched, vulnerable services listening on standard ports,
-   hijacking accounts that are not properly secured,
-   attacking systems that are not properly secured by host firewalls, and
-   deploying Trojans embedded in the software component in the VM or within the VM image itself.

To avoid such threats and vulnerabilities, it is useful to adopt a _secure-by-default_ configuration; this includes tracking the inventory of VM images and OS versions that are prepared for cloud hosting. The IaaS provider responsible for secure provision of VM images, but other shared responsibilities includes:

-   protecting the integrity of the hardened image from unauthorized access,
-   safeguarding the private keys required to access hosts in the public cloud,
-   isolating the decryption keys from the cloud where the data is hosted,
-   including no authentication credentials in your virtualized images except for a key to decrypt the filesystem key,
-   disallowing password-based authentication for shell access,
-   requiring passwords for sudo or role-based access,
-   running a host firewall and open only the minimum ports necessary to support the services on an instance,
-   running only the required services and turn off the unused services,
-   installing a host-based IDS,
-   enabling system auditing and event logging, and
-   logging the security events to a dedicated log server.

##### Cloud security - application level

In addition to well known application vulnerabilities, and well known attack types, clouds can experience shaped attacks. For example, an application-level DoS attack could manifest itself as a high-volume web page reloads, XML web services requests, or protocol-specific requests supported by a cloud service. These kinds of attack can be particularly dangerous because it is difficult to selectively filter the malicious traffic without impacting the service as a whole. DoS attacks on pay-as-you-go cloud applications result in an increased cloud utility bill due to increased use of network bandwidth, CPU, and storage consumption. These attacks can also being characterized as economic denial of sustainability (EdoS). Resources need to be protected, in terms of account protection since, using hijacked or exploited cloud accounts, hackers will be able to link together computing resources to achieve massive amounts of computing without any of the capital infrastructure costs.

End user should be conscious of security by taking appropriate steps to protect browsers from attacks, and installing patches and updates in a timely basis to mitigate threats related to browser vulnerabilities. However, as cloud-based service becomes widespread, relying on users alone may not be sustainable, so providers need to be give some kind of assurance of adequate security. This assurance might be in the form of legal responsibility; for example, SaaS providers are largely responsible for securing the applications and components they offer to customers, while customers are usually responsible for operational security functions, including user and access management as supported by the provider. Even if there is no industry standard for assess software security and benchmarking providers against a baseline, additional controls should be implemented to manage privileged access to SaaS administration tools, and enforcing segregation of duties to protect the application from insider threats. Such controls are familiar, and include identity management and access control mechanisms, browser hardening, multifactor authentication, IPS and antivirus as well as detective measures like login history and periodic analysis.

In a PaaS context, developers need to become familiar with specific APIs for deploying and managing software modules to enforce security controls as part of their product life cycle. In theory, developers should expect CSPs to offer a set of security features, including user authentication, single sign-on (SSO), authorization, and SSL or TLS support, made available via the API.

Maturity is a problem due to a lack of PaaS security management standardisation. Consequently, developers need to be familiar with the mechanisms exposed by their respective cloud service provider. The duties of the CSPs responsible for core security tenets include containment and isolation of multitenant applications from each other, as well as for monitoring new bugs and vulnerabilities that may be used to exploit the PaaS platform and break out of the sandbox architecture. Network and host security monitoring outside the PaaS platform is also the responsibility of the PaaS cloud provider.

For IaaS models, matters are predominantly left in the hand of end users. Customers should not expect any application security assistance from CSPs beyond basic guidance on firewall policies that may affect the applicationâ€™s communications with other applications, users, or services within or outside the cloud.

Again, customers are responsible for keeping their applications and runtime platform patched to protect the system from malware and hackers scanning for vulnerabilities to gain unauthorized access to their data in the cloud, and highly recommended to design and implement applications with a â€œleast-privilegedâ€ runtime model. In this scenario, applications should be designed to leverage delegated authentication service features supported by an enterprise Identity Provider. However, any custom implementations of Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting (AAA) features can become a weak link if they are not properly implemented. Useful preventive controls should comprise proper (application developer employed) security-embedded SDLC process, least-privileged configuration, timely patching, proper Authentication and authorization and accounting, as well as browser hardening. The application developer should also put in place appropriate end-point security, like IPS, host-based IDS, firewall, antivirus, and provide secure access (e.g. virtual private network) for management. Detective controls should be appropriately deployed in terms of logging, event correlation, application vulnerability scanning (preferrably using penetration testing techniques and tools, like metasploit and OSSTMM methodology)

### Cloud security alliance Top Threats

Cloud security alliance organization also provided a series of Top Threats specifically suited for Cloud computing, along the line of OWASP Top Threats. These threats allow to focus on specific useful countermeasures, and so to mitigate main risk of the Cloud identified so far. ([[Deliverable_References#CSA-TopThreats|CSA-TopThreats]])

#### abuse and nefarious use of cloud computing

The registration process offered by some devices, who accept anyone with a valid credit card, or even worst the offer of limited trial periods, allow spammers, worms author and criminals in general to conduct unauthorized activities with relative anonymity and impunity. This involve particularly IaaS and PaaS models.
Mitigation for this kind of problems, would be a stricter registration and validation process, e.g. monitoring of fresh credit card frauds, monitoring of user network traffic (possibly in aggregate form, to respect privacy issue) and monitoring

#### insecure interfaces and APIs

Providers should be very careful in exposing software interfaces to interact with cloud services, and design these interfaces adopting proper encryption, authentication, access controls and monitoring to avoid policy circumvention, like anonymous access and or reusable authentication tokens, monitoring and logging capabilities unable to identify key events, unknown service and API dependencies. This kind of problem is quite generic and involve Cloud models of IaaS, PaaS and SaaS types.

To mitigate such a problem, it’s needed knowledge of dependency chain associated with the API, as well as mandatory strong authentication in concert with encrypted transmission.

#### Malicious insiders

IaaS, PaaS and SaaS models suffer of the convergence services and customers under a single management domain, often combined with lack of transparency of providers internal processes. In this way, opportunities for harvesting confidential data or gain unauthorized control over the cloud service can be achieved with little risk of detection.

This is remediable by a proper organizational (e.g. a strict supply chain management with associated supplier assessment) and legal (specification of resource requirements as part of legal contracts) framework. Clear, transparent and well-established information security management, as well as compliance reporting as well as security breach notification processes also contribute to mitigate this issue.

#### Shared technology issues

Shared technology must implement strong isolation properties for a multi-tenant architecture. Access of resources should be mediated by the virtualization hypervisor, which manages guest operating systems and prevents improper resource accesss or control on the underlying system. However, even hypervisors can be flawed, and cause unwanted influence of the underlying platform by the guest operating system.

To prevent this critical issues, which is especially sensitive in IaaS model, security best practice must be adopted when installing and configuring the system. Monitoring system must adequately identify unauthorised changes and suspect activities. Strong authentication and fine-grained access controls should enforce proper administrative access and operations. Vulnerability scanning and configuration audit should be performed periodically, and a proper threat management process should ensure prompt patching and vulnerability remediation.

#### Data loss or leakage

Since data in the cloud can possibly be physically unbinded to local users, cloud-based data management must avoid alteration of records with no backup, as well a loss of encoding keys (which may result in effective data destruction) and unauthorized access to sensitive data. This is a general problem which any of IaaS, PaaS and SaaS model have to prevent.

This kind of problem can be mitigated by some security best practice, like detailed API access control, encryption and integrity protection of data in transit (driven by a careful analysis of data protection scheme both at design and run time), implementation of secure key generation and life cycle management (e.g. storage and destruction procedures). An appropriate legal framework is useful as well (e.g. contractual obligations for providers to wipe persistent media before releases of sensitive data, contractual specification of backup and data retention strategies)

#### Account or service hijacking

Being a network based model, cloud is vulnerable to phishing, fraud and software vulnerability exploitation. Giving that credentials and password are often reused, the impact of such attacks is amplified. This is because account owners are often unaware that their accounts have been exploited to form the basis of further malicious actions. All IaaS, PaaS and SaaS can suffer of these issues.

A mandatory policy on credentials (e.g. prohibit sharing of passwords or credentials between users and services), and the leveraging on multi-factor authentication techniques (whenever possible) as well as proactive monitoring to promptly identify unauthorized entities can alleviate impact of this threat.

#### Unknown risk profile

A detailed knowledge of security posture is importance for threat prevention. Understanding the software, software updates, security practices, intrusion attempts, and employed security controls are important factors in understanding current risk level and planning adequate modifications. The temptation of employing _security by obscurity_ should be avoided as opaque designs make in-depth analysis difficult. This is a general concern that is valid for all cloud models.

Mitigating practices include providing information about who is sharing the infrastructure, disclosure of network intrusion logs, redirection attempts (and success), and partial/full disclosure of infrastructure details (e.g. patch level, firewalls, etc). Even if not intuitive, these processes foster a more vulnerability-free and secure system.
