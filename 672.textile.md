NPAPI
=====

A cross browser plug-in which uses OS functionality to support plug-in.
See Habib’s presentation about how NPAPI works in FF (bottom of the page).

Pros
----

-   Event handling, Networking function and Onscreen drawing
-   Widely adopted and supported in all major browser except Microsoft IE.

Cons
----

-   Considered to be weak standard, every browser has its own interpretation
-   Restricted to using local OS functionality. Not cross platform.
-   Look and feel differ in each native environment
-   Runs in same context of the parent process, it is not spawned as a new thread#

What could we use in webinos from NPAPI?
----------------------------------------

### API for making use of an plugin (perspective app developer)

A standard browser plugin is embeded into the web app using the `<embed>`. By specifiying the MIME-type of the object the registered plugin for this MIME type is loaded.

<pre>
<code class="html">
<embed type="application/webinos-extension-x1">
</code>
</pre>

In addition an API for checking the availability of a plugin for a given MIME-type is available.
<pre>
<code class="javascript">
<script type="text/javascript">
if (navigator.mimeTypes["application/webinos-extension-x1"] &&
 navigator.mimeTypes["application/webinos-extension-x1"].enabledPlugin != null)
 document.write(‘<embed type="application/webinos-extension-x1">’);
</script>
</code>
</pre>

### API for making a plugin installable by the browser

The name, a description, a version number and the supported MIME-Type must be specified by the plugin developer. For specifying these attributes the following functions from the npfunctions.h header file must be implemented:
<pre>
<code class="c">
NP_EXPORT (const char*) NP_GetMIMEDescription()
NP_EXPORT (char*) NP_GetPluginVersion()
// Called during initialization to retrieve the plug-in’s name and
// description, which will appear in the navigator.plugins DOM
// object which is used to populate about:plugins.
NP_EXPORT (NPError) NP_GetValue(void* future, NPPVariable aVariable, void* aValue)
</code>
</pre>

### Interface for making methods, properties and attributes of the plugin available and firing events
