Service Discovery API
=====================

Between version 7 and version 12 of this document huge changes were made. A rationale for these changes can be found in attachment:Webinos-WP3-ServiceDiscoveryRationale.pptx. The changes itself can be found here: http://dev.webinos.org/redmine/wiki/t3-2/Service_Discovery_API/diff?version=12&version_from=7&commit=View+differences

Service Discovery
-----------------

### Philosophy

Important webinos distinctions are reflected in the interface.

These important distinctions are:
* Location
* Self and Friends
* Devices and Services

Furthermore, ‘reflected in the interface’ means the classes, objects and methods of the API model location, friends and (own) devices. Other (search) parameters that are not core webinos (like number of mega pixels on a camera) are indeed parameters of the search functions.

### Synchronous and asynchronous

Both should be possible. Clean asynchronous behaviour is demonstrated in e.g. the GeoLocation API found at http://dev.w3.org/geo/api/spec-source.html. Synchronous querying is useful only in situations that allow for that, and always means ‘give me the situation at this point’. Could be used when working with (lists of) friends, the (known) camera on the current device or other slow-changing information.

More detail to be added after discussion.

### Location

Two types of location are important:
# location of persons (owner, friends)
# location of services (and the devices these run on)

Webinos provides ‘easy to handle’ abstractions of these, which improve both privacy and usability. Supported abstractions are ‘home’, ‘near’, ‘postal codes (in combination with country)’. Thought must be given how the HTML5 GeoLocation API can be brought into webinos without redoing it.

Interface design:

<pre><code class="javascript">
 // TODO

// AND also support constructions like:
 location.isNearHome() // returns boolean
</code></pre>

Thought must be given as to how webinos can use location in an optimal manner.

### Search parameters

When searching for services, service parameters are formulated according to RFC 4515: Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP): String Representation of Search Filters (see http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4515).

Examples are:
<pre><code class="javascript">
 webinos.findFriends("(Email=stefani@ladygaga.com)", foundFriendCallback);
 webinos.findServices("(Type=navigation)", foundServiceCallback);
 webinos.findServices("&(Type=camera)(MP>6)", foundServiceCallback);
</code></pre>

Benefits are:
* simple yet powerful
* standardised
* resources abundantly available (documentation, examples, libraries)

### Class diagram

Note that HTML5 GeoLocation is something different than webinos location. How different is up for discussion.

### Interface design

<pre>
 Objects:
 location
 service
 device
 user
 owner
 friend
</pre>

Example of a "one-shot" service discovery request:
<pre><code class="javascript">
 function showPhoto(camera) {
 // Take and show a photo
 }

showPhoto(webinos.currentDevice.camera);
</code></pre>

Example of a service discovery request using a camera that is somewhere else:
<pre><code class="javascript">
 function showPhoto(camera) {
 // Take and show a photo
 }

webinos.findServices("&(Type=camera)(!location=Location.HERE)", showPhoto);
</code></pre>

Example of a service discovery request with error handling:
<pre><code class="javascript">
 function showPhoto(camera) {
 // Take and show a photo
 }

function errorCallBack(errno) {
 // Update a div element with error.message.
 }

// Find all services of type ‘camera’ but take no longer than 10 seconds
 webinos.findServices("(Type=camera)", showPhoto, errorCallBack, {timeout:10000});
</code></pre>

Some more cool constructs:
<pre><code class="javascript">
 webinos.owner // owner object, derived from user class
 webinos.friends // array of users (from cache)

webinos.location // location object (shorthand for webinos.currentDevice.location)
 webinos.owner.location // location object, indicating where the formal owner of this device is (can be different from location of device!)
 webinos.devices // array of device objects
 webinos.services // array of service objects (from cache, so address-ability + reach-ability + policy unknown)

webinos.friend["victor@tno.nl"].findServices(LDAP query, callBack);

webinos.findFriends(LDAP query, callback);

webinos.onServiceChange(); // takes (anonymous) function, called until nullified
 webinos.onFriendChange(); // takes (anonymous) function, called until nullified
</code></pre>

### Service Binding

After a service is found (discovered), an actual instance (â€œthing that we can useâ€) must be available. The process of getting such an instance is called binding.

â€œnotice and consentâ€: both, service and application need to mutually agree
* applicationâ€™s PZP checks authentication and privacy policies by serviceâ€™s PZP
* serviceâ€™s PZP checks authentication and privacy policies by applicationâ€™s PZP
* webinos might present UI, save decisions

â€¦ if agreed â€¦

Note that a service might need elevated privileges to run, but thatâ€™s been agreed upon installation of the service / application, so doesnâ€™t need to be checked again here. Requested permissions might dynamically change after installation, e.g. expansion of the use of memory.

<pre><code class="javascript">
 function serviceFound(s) {
 s.bind();
 // Use service
 }

webinos.findServices("...insert query…", serviceFound);
</pre>

The return code of bind() must be checked, as binding may fail:
* binding attempt timed out
* service no longer available
* permissions changed

### Service Auto-binding

For common services a separate bind() should not be necessary.
