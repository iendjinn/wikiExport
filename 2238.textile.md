Tethering API scenarios and use cases
=====================================

WITHDRAWN

The goal of the tethering API is twofold. On a basic level: to share internet connectivity. In more abstract terms: to investigate how to leverage the webinos security architecture in non-webinos use cases. This latter goal requires some more contemplation.

Consider this scenario:
# two users are in close proximity, e.g. in the same room
# one of them has cellular internet connectivity, the other one doesnâ€™t
# they both have webinos

The steps needed to provide tethering capabilities to the unconnected user depend on the surroundings. Either there is wifi available, or there isnâ€™t:

In case there is, the tethering-providing phone may very well have difficulty with having to support ad-hoc mode (to connect to the access point) and infrastructure mode (for tethering) simultaneously. For the moment, letâ€™s assume this does not pose any problems. Also assume that the wifi does not provide internet access itself. Now on the subnet, the PZPs discovery each other. The proposed tethering API is discovered, invoked and results in handing over the SSID and pass phrase of the tethered connection. The user that wants to tether disconnects from wifi, and uses the provided details to reconnect on the tethered connection. This process may be automated.

In case there isnâ€™t, the phones first need to discover one another through use of some other bearer, like Bluetooth. For the exchange of the credentials (which is what the tethering API is for) a connection must be established, e.g. through the Personal Area Network (PAN) profile. But hey, this already provides tethering capabilities!

In conclusion, the scenarios above show that the tethering API is either usable in a very small number of cases (with wifi that has no internet access) or unnecessary (with another bearer).
