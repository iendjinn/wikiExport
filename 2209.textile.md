Context Manager
===============

Main premise
------------

The scope of this area encompasses all the necessary activities that pertain to gathering, storing and making available context within webinos, particularly the following objectives are to be addressed:
* Identification of Context data relevant for the webinos operation.
* Detection of Context Data within webinos (through the webinos entities) and related Context Sources _identification of existing APIs to be used_
* Acquisition of Context Data for webinos system _identification of existing APIs to be used_
* Representation of Context Data within webinos _definition of the necessary context structures in specific data format_
* Storage of Context Data within webinos _definition of suitable data storage facility
* Distribution of Context Data among webinos entities _specification of the necessary APIs to be created_

The webinos context framework provides access to contextualized data in order to enable the design and operation of context-driven webinos applications/services.

The framework is responsible for collecting and storing context data (through the identification of specific context related events that happen within webinos enabled devices) and providing applications with a layer to access such data either by querying against the storage or by being notified in real time for context changes (when specific events happen).

A context-aware application either makes use of a single piece, a combination, or a time series of context related data, for example, the current state of the compass on a mobile phone, the current state of the ambient light sensor of a laptop computer or the geographic location and the closest Wi-Fi networks, in order to make an automatic contextual reconfiguration (e.g. increase the brightness of the monitor, enable Wi-Fi connectivity) or enable a proximate selection (e.g. highlight Points Of Interest geographically located near the user or print a document on the closest printer). In order to take advantage of such functionality, an application developer has to have access to means of acquiring contextual data, storing them, filtering them, combining them and performing commands based on the resulting information. For ubiquitous, distributed and context-aware computing applications, the aim is to provide appropriate middleware that can perform Remote Process Calls (RPCs), while at the same time introducing an abstraction layer that will facilitate the development process, by hiding the heterogeneity of the networking environment, supporting advanced coordination models among distributed entities and making as transparent as possible the distribution of computation.

The webinos project aims to provide a cross-platform level of abstraction for procedural calls, but at the same time, incorporate an additional data abstraction layer for use in third party context-aware and context-sharing applications that are webinos-enabled. The main data construct relating to contextual information in webinos is the Context Object. Inspired by the definition of a meme, a Context Object is a unit for carrying data that uniquely defines a piece of contextual information. For example, whereas a call to a GPS sensor will return a number of outputs (latitude, longitude, heading, speed, accuracy and altitude accuracy), one relevant Context Object that can be called MyLocation will contain only the most relevant data that can define the unit, by excluding some and/or adding others, in this case ending up with latitude, longitude, accuracy, altitude accuracy and time. Context data collection can be performed in three ways:
* **RPC Interception**: There is an automatic mechanism that, with the permission of the user via the Policy Manager, can intercept RPCs made by webinos-enabled applications to the various webinos APIs. The Context Manager transforms the message to a Context Object, by selecting fields that are considered to be containing contextual information in the RPC and structuring them as Context Objects, via the extensive API Context Vocabulary. The API Context Vocabulary is a list of structures and rules for the automatic contextualization of intercepted RPC messages.
* **Context Service**: Context Objects can be registered for periodic background data collection when the PZP is running by defining Context Rules for the Context Object to be stored, the polling interval, the conditions and the collection method.
* **Application Context Objects**: Context Objects can be defined and stored independently by any application. An application can request the registration of a new custom Context Object and request permission from the Policy Manager to start storing these Objects to the Context DB. The application can define its own process to obtaining the data for these objects, as well as the frequency and their lifetime. An application developer can make use of the webinos Application Context Vocabulary to define these custom rules and structures for storing application-specific Context Objects, or ones that are derived by any process or combination of preexisting or new contextual data.

The database where these Context Objects are stored securely is located at a user’s Virtual PZP and is reached via a channel opened by the PZH. The Context DB contains data from across the devices and applications in a Personal Zone (PZ) and each database is unique for that PZ. Querying the Context DB is achieved through a simple to use dedicated query builder that allows the treatment of the Context DB as an Object-Oriented Database, focusing on its main construct, the Context Object. The developer can perform queries directly to the Context API, with the prospect of acquiring any type of Context Objects, created by any API, any application and any device across the user’s PZ.

Context Functionality
---------------------

The Context Manager’s key functionality can be summed up in the following points:

-   Automatically keeps a log of all RPC calls, stripped from the parameters and results to the PZP in a locally stored log.json file.
-   Contains the Webinos API Context Vocabulary, which is a description of the APIs, their methods exposed to the WRT, the expected structure of their parameters and the expected structure of their results, structured under Context Objects that would produce similar contextual information (e.g. MyLocation is a the same Context Object irrespective of whether it is produced by Geolocation API’s getCurrentPosition, watchPosition or from a call the Vehicle’s API GPS functionality).
-   Automatically intercepts RPC calls of API methods.
-   Automatically intercepts the registration of API listeners and tracks the callbacks in order to match them to the corresponding registration call, structuring them as unique RPC calls.
-   Automatically looks up every RPC call in the Webinos Context Vocabulary, finds the corresponding match based on the API making the call, the name of the method called and in some cases the parameters used to match the call to a Context Object. The call’s input and output data are structured based on the Webinos Context Vocabulary’s rules, disallowing data like passwords and other sensitive information that are excluded from any contextual query and are not to be passed to the Policy Manager.
-   Context Objects created from RPC calls are stored in a buffer file if the Virtual PZP holding the Context DB is not connected.
-   Context Objects created from RPC calls and those included in the context object buffer are sent to the Virtual PZP to be stored in the SQLite3 Context DB.
-   Allows the definition of custom Context Objects in a separate Webinos Application Context Vocabulary directly from the WRT.
-   Applications can request their own uniquely defined Context Objects to be stored in the Virtual PZP Context DB using the same structure as all other context data.
-   The data in the Context DB can be queried from the WRT using a custom Context Querying structure that allows the description of simple or complex queries containing sub-queries as related to Context Objects, treating the database as descriptive of Object Models. The results are returned as Context Objects.
-   Polling Rules can be registered. In these, an API call can be scheduled in predefined intervals and the result is automatically intercepted by the Context Manager.
-   Context Event Listeners can be registered. A rule can be applied, where the when a specific condition is met and a Context Query returns a result, that result will trigger an event to the application that registered the listener.
-   Integration with the Policy Manager gives permissions to APIs and applications to store Context Objects in the Virtual PZP Context DB.
-   Integration with the Policy Manager gives permissions to applications to run context queries to the Virtual PZP Context DB.
-   Integration with the Policy Manager gives permissions to applications to create and enforce Context Rules.

Context Manager Data Flow Overview
----------------------------------

The proposed architecture can be summed up to the following Data Flow diagram:

![](http://dev.webinos.org/redmine/attachments/3371/context_manager_schema_v3.png)

The new requirements to be added include the registration of context objects to be extracted and stored locally per device, either based on simple extraction rules or more complex rules that describe Context Objects as results of more complex queries, without the requirement of a connection with the Virtual PZP holding the Context DB. For example, a statistical rule applied on the MyLocations Context Objects can generate a more permanent Context Object called MyHome or MyWorkPlace.

Another requirement is the addition of a background service that will store API Context Objects while the PZP is running and without an application making specific API calls. The registration of such listeners should be implemented in the same way that Application Context Objects are defined through the Policy Manager.

It is very clear that users are not very good at understanding the future value of keeping personal information private and are often quick to share the ownership of such information without evaluating the impact of its possible uses. With this in mind, the webinos platform ensures that the ownership of contextual information stays with the user, while access rights to applications to store, extract or query context data can be given by the user to the application and not the application developer. This allows the developer to build applications that can utilize Context Objects that are stored by the webinos platform or other applications in the same PZA. In order to further secure the privacy of personal data, all transactions with the Context DB are monitored by the webinos policy manager and specific access rights to read/write, to and from the Context DB are provided per application and per type and per source of Context Objects.

Additionally, with the advancement of the Policy Manager and the ability to create more complex policy rules, each Context API call will have a number of policy events relating to it in the following axes:

-   Context API Method
-   Read/Write
-   Application making the request
-   Data Object (Context Object, rule to be added/updated etc)

Context Vocabulary
------------------

The context vocabulary is based on a structure that defines context objects in relation to the APIs they belong to. In this sense, the structure starts from the definition of the API and the data required to recognize it, then the name of the Context Object captured. Finally, the structure of the methods and the data relating to either the capturing of data as part of a Context Object, or the expected values for validation of a specific method. A generic example of this structure is as follows.

<pre>

 "APIname" : "Name of API",

Deployment Diagram
------------------

The Context Manager/ Context API is deployed in three locations:
* A designated Virtual PZP that holds the ContextDB and the server side of the Context Manager and Context API,
* the PZH, that holds the settings necessary to reach the Virtual PZP that holds the ContextDB and
* the PZP side of the Context Manager and Context API

Message Interception and storage
--------------------------------

The Context Manager automatically intercepts messages that are delivered to APIs, looks them up in the Context API vocabulary, filters and transforms their content to a format that is meaningful for context related queries. This data is forwarded to the Virtual PZP that holds the ContextDB and are stored. In case the PZH or the Virtual PZP are unreachable, the data is stored on a flat file that acts as a buffer of data to be inserted to the ContextDB, until a connection to the Virtual PZP is established.

Context Querying
----------------

Querying Context Data is performed via a querying mechanism that translates a high lever Context Query to a low level DB query intended for the context DB. The query builder allow the creation of queries based on the following clauses:

-   **eq**: Equals
-   **lt**: Less than
-   **le**: Less or equal than
-   **gt**: Greater than
-   **ge**: Greater or equal than
-   **starts**: Starts with
-   **ends**: Ends with
-   **in**: In the given list. The value must be and array.
-   **contains**: Value contains the given value, only applicable to DOMString

The sequence of events in the case that a caller, may it be an application or an internal call is as follows:

Context Rules
-------------

A context rule is defined as a context query that is set to run on specific time intervals on the ContextDB and make its results available to any application on any connected PZP that has policy clearance to draw the result. If the rule has a very specific condition, the event will not be fired until the condition is met. If a Rule has not been renewed by the application for a month, the rule becomes inactive.

Scheduled API Calls
-------------------

If an application requires constant polling of a Context Object, it can request from the policy manager to register a Scheduled API Call from a specific list of APIs for a specific time interval. The scheduled API calls are valid for a month since the moment they are initiated. If no application renews the registration of the scheduled calls in that period, the scheduled API call becomes inactive.
