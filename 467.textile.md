Overlay networking
==================

This is about a separation of concerns, enabling a simple model for discovery and messaging that hides unnecessary details from end users and web developers.

There are many interconnect technologies, e.g.

-   3G, WiFi, WiMAX, Bluetooth, ZigBee, NFC, RJ45, USB, IEEE 1394, …

Some of these directly support IP addressing, others do not. This means that webinos will need to allow an IP addressable device to act as a proxy for non IP addressable devices. A further complication is that the discovery mechanisms and associated terminology vary, resulting in considerable complexity if exposed directly to web developers.

Direct communication between devices may be possible where devices share the same technology and have appropriate software. Otherwise, some form of gateway will be needed. This could be local as in a home gateway or situated somewhere out in the cloud, e.g. when connecting a 3G phone to a TV with a WiFi LAN card connected via an ADSL modem. Web developers should be shielded from the details of how messages are sent from one device to another, including passage through firewalls and network address translation. For mobile networks, the overlay network layer could optimize the use of the network by aggregating notifications over the same connection.

Local objects as proxies for remote ones
----------------------------------------

Developing web applications is greatly simplified if the developer doesn’t need to focus on the protocols and addressing schemes for use for particular devices/services. This can be achieved by using local objects as proxies for remote ones. The proxies could be expressed in JavaScript or as markup. The pattern is essentially:

<pre> var obj = new Name(args);</pre>

or as markup:

<pre> <Name>args</Name></pre>

where the "Name" identifies the base type of the requested service, and the args are used by the discovery and binding process. The proxy object is created immediately, but it will often take some time to bind it to the remote object it stands in for. The binding event could be signaled by a DOM event, or by calling a function supplied by the web page script as is the case for the Web Sockets API. You can then access the remote service by calling methods on the object or targeting events at it.

The object’s implementation will in many cases be defined as a library component provided by third party developers, who are skilled programmers. It is their job to hide the complexity from regular web developers.

### Asynchronous Interfaces

Querying a remote service takes time and necessitates an asynchronous programming model that doesn’t block the browser’s UI. One work around is to use threads and synchronization, however, the subtleties of cross thread synchronization and data locking have prevented this approach from being adopted for web page scripts. The alternative is to use continuations, call backs and events.

In some cases a proxy object could provide a synchronous interface to copies of properties that the object’s implementation synchronizes with the remote object it stands for.

### Ad hoc and peer to peer connections

Web applications should be able to work in peer to peer mode without the need for servers. This can be realized for devices on the same ad hoc WiFi network, or connected locally in some other way (Bluetooth?). The web app needs a way to listen for multicast or unicast requests, and to be able to set up event and media streams. We therefore should consider allocation of a multicast address and port for use by webinos on local networks for the purpose of exchanging events. A plausible choice for IPv4 is 239.255.255.253 in the range assigned by RFC 2365 as a locally administered address space with local or organizational scope.

P2P connections across firewalls and well behaved NAT boundaries involve the use of adjunct servers. Each device in a personal zone connects directly or indirectly to a zone server in the Internet. This facilitates establishing connections between devices in the same zone and also across zones, e.g. connecting your device with that of a friends.

For cellular devices, we could allow for use of wakeup SMS messages as an alternative to keeping open long lived connections. This would save on both battery and network resources.

Dynamic Context
---------------

The overlay networking layer will necessitate some means for syncing changes to the context.

Personal Zones
--------------

Users could have a personal zone that includes their devices and cloud-based services. The overlay network stores the mapping between the user’s names and preferences, and the underlying interconnect details as part of the user’s personal zone. Your devices sync their data within your personal zone. Your contacts, calendar and social network connections are all held in a unified model.

In JavaScript, you could get access to the device owner’s zone with:

<pre> var myzone = new PersonalZone();</pre>

This assumes the web page has also loaded the scripts for the webinos code, and any third party add-ons. An open question is whether it is necessary to use the new operator or whether the object is automatically created. The personal zone can only be accessed by web page scripts with the user’s prior permission. It provides access to the user’s social graph, e.g.

<pre> var andre = myzone.friend("andre");</pre>

where "andre" is a name for a friend in the user’s social graph, which may be resident on a server. The method therefore returns a late bound object, i.e. one that is incomplete when first returned. Libraries implementing the overlay layer will need to be aware of such late bound objects and to deal with them as part of a continuation based pattern.

### Discovery

The "discovery demo":http://www.w3.org/2011/04/discovery.html supports scanning on multicast DNS, SSDP (i.e. UPnP), SLP, BLuetooth and USB. It makes use of the following pattern:

<pre>
 var obj = {
 scan: function ()
 {
 },

found: function ()
 {
 }
 };

obj.scan();
</pre>

where the object’s found method is called whenever a matching device/service is found via multicast DNS or Bluetooth, etc.

We have the potential to pass semantically rich constraints to the scan method, which then need to be implemented as part of the overlay layer, i.e. the scan and found methods in the object’s definition. A web developer could write:

<pre>
 <script src="webinos-core.js"></script>
 <script src="webinos-addon.js"></script>

<script type="text/javascript">
 var myzone = new PersonalZone();

var andre = myzone.friend("andre");

var andre_phone = new Phone({"owner":andre});

andre_phone.get_location(function (loc)
 {
 if (loc.nearby(myzone.location))
 // do something
 });
 </script>
</pre>

This code snippet raises the challenge of how to make continuation based programming bearable. Methods could return synchronously with late bound objects. The variable andre above is created immediately, but actually takes time to be bound as the library may need to query a social graph held on a server. The "new Phone()" statement knows about late bound objects and hides the complexity of the discovery process. I’ve used a JSON valued argument for maximum flexibility. The get_location method takes a function to be called when the location becomes available.

I am hoping that the above example illustrates the difficulties of coming up with nice friendly APIs for regular web developers. I am not worried about the third party library developers as they are pointy headed programming nerds.

Note that identity is reduced to scoped names, in this case, to the names I use for my friends in my social graph.

Webinos should define the low level APIs for the third party nerds, as well as some common high level APIs. However, I believe we need to recognize that third parties will define their own high level APIs via their libraries.

### User Preferences

Users express their preferences in terms of their social connections, e.g.

-   My friend Jane can send messages to my TV

where Jane is listed as one of my friends. This is mapped to lower level access control rules as appropriate to the interconnect technologies.

### Privacy

Privacy can be considered in terms of restricting leakage of information across social contexts. To help with this, a machine interpretable representation of privacy policies will enable the overlay networking model to check for clashes with the user’s social network preferences. An important concept is the notion of the "face" you present in different social contexts, e.g. when in private, in front of your friends, your acquaintances, your work colleagues or in public. This can be used as an organizing principle for the user interface.

Implementation Details
----------------------

We will need to provide browser extensions to support the discovery and messaging model at a low level. The overlay networking layer is implemented as JavaScript libraries that hide these details and synchronize data across the user’s personal zone. Such libraries could be loaded explicitly as part of web pages (as is the case for jQuery) or injected by browser extensions.

### Development Roadmap

The first step is to develop a standalone demonstrator that implements the various low level discovery and messaging mechanisms. This will then be refined into a binary browser extension. We can then explore the overlay network model via developing JavaScript libraries. The personal zone concept will involve developing some server-side scripts for syncing the context and for supporting the establishment of peer to peer connections. The social network aspects could be implemented as collaborating server-side modules as part of distributed social networks.
