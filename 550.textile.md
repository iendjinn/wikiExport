Introduction
------------

This document investigates the possibility of using XMPP as a mechanism to transmit events over the network for Webinos.

As the starting point, we define a set of typical use cases. Based on the use cases, we will cover the following areas:

1.  Candidate solution using XMPP
2.  Gap Analysis between the proposed solution with Remote Notifications and Messaging requirements of Webinos
3.  Proposals to fill the Gaps found in 2.

The output of this document shall contribute to architecture design of the Event handling mechanism of Webinos.

Requirements
------------

It is possible to summarize the desired functionality by the following high-level requirements:

-   It SHALL be possible to exchange data among multiple entities in terms of events.
-   It SHALL be possible to subscribe/unsubscribe to certain events, according to some criteria (e.g., event source, event type), in order to be notified about the occurrence of such events.
-   Events that cannot be immediately delivered SHALL be cached, possibly within certain timing constraints, if any are given.

Work Scenarios - Use cases
--------------------------

-   Alice wants to notify Bob about a concert taking place in the weekend. She sends such notification through an application that generates a Webinos notification event, and, if heâ€™s not currently available, such notification event is delivered to Bob as soon as he connects to the Internet with any device he owns.
-   A group of friends in a room want to play a Webinos game. Once their devices are connected, the game application updates the shared status using Webinos events that are exchanged among the different application instances on each device.
-   A Webinos-enabled GPS sensor provides positioning information in terms of Webinos events. Subscribed listeners are delivered this information as soon as it is published.
-   An online service aggregates and forwards the content of a bunch of RSS feeds in terms of Webinos events. Subscribed listeners are delivered such content as soon as it is published (i.e., information is pushed to the listeners rather than pulled by them). If a listener is not able to receive events (e.g., not connected), events are cached and forwarded to it later.
-   A Webinos-enabled navigator device on a car has an application that can receive traffic information in terms of Webinos events from a remote server. It works by registering as a listener to the remote traffic information event source and regularly sends to it GPS fix data and suggested/selected route. Moreover, the user is allowed to report further information to the server, in terms of events, regarding, e.g., traffic jams and incidents.

Candidate technology
--------------------

XMPP seems to be a natural candidate to perform event trasmission over the network, since it does already address most of the issues hereby discussed.

### XMPP

#### Technical details

-   Formerly known as Jabber, XMPP is an open, decentralized and extensible protocol for near-real-time XML data exchange, is backed and formalized by IETF (RFCs 3920-3923, 4854, 4979, 5122) and further developed by the "XMPP Standards Foundation":http://xmpp.org/. In particular, the XMPP Standard Foundation has developed a series of extensions to the protocol, known as XEPs, that address quite a significant number of concrete applications beyond the scope of the core protocol.
-   The use of XMPP inside Webinos is being considered in several different areas, since it seems to offer concrete solutions to a significant number of problems that we are facing. Furthermore, several mature implementations are already available, some of which are open source and Javascript-only, and also its decentralized and extensible design should be attractive for our purposes, also w.r.t. future and/or unforeseen developments.
-   The protocol is decentralized in the sense that there is no central authoritative server. Instead, domain names (or IP addresses) in JIDs are used in a similar fashion to e-mails to refer to servers.
-   A typical message delivery scenario between two entities involves four actors: the two said entites and the two XMPP servers they are connected to (or just one server if they both are connected to the same server). The message is routed from the sender entity to the XMPP server it is connected to, then to the server the other entity is connected to and, eventually, to the receiving entity. However, it is possible to also have other means of exchanging data, e.g., serverless using "XEP-0174":http://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0174.html.
-   Typically. when a client connects to a server, it goes through an authentication procedure based on SASL and the traffic is encrypted using TLS.
-   Two of the most important XEPs are "XEP-0060: Publish-Subscribe":http://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0060.html, that is a protocol enabling "entities to create nodes (topics) at a pubsub service and publish information at those nodes", so that "an event notification (with or without payload) is then broadcasted to all entities that have subscribed to the node", and "XEP-0050: Ad-Hoc Commands":http://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0050.html, that is a "protocol extension for advertising and executing application-specific commands, such as those related to a configuration workflow".
-   Messages exchanged via XMPP are in XML format. The core protocol specifies three message types: "presence" that carry user presence information, "message" used for instant messaging, and "iq" that stands for info/query (often used by extensions to define more message types).

#### Gap Analysis and Proposals

-   The following gap analysis assumes that the "ontology" (i.e., the definition of generic information it contains) of a Webinos event is previously defined.

  NM-DEV-FOKUS-001   A bidirectional mapping between Webinos events and XMPP messages is needed                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            Definition of the XML XMPP payload that describes a Webinos event
  NM-DEV-FOKUS-002   W.r.t. events that are "managed" by a third-party (e.g., XMPP server) a bidirectional mapping between XMPP PubSub requests and Webinos subscription/unsubscription requests may be needed (i.e., to avoid requiring special handling on the server side), otherwise subscription requests may very well be "regular" Webinos events themselves.   Definition of such mapping
  NM-DEV-FOKUS-003   W.r.t. events that are "managed" by a third-party (e.g., XMPP server) a bidirectional mapping between XMPP PubSub nodes and Webinos event sources may be needed (i.e., to avoid requiring special handling on the server side)                                                                                                                      Definition of such mapping

  NM-DEV-FOKUS-006   Message delivery receipts are not part of the core protocol                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           "XEP-0184: Message Delivery Receipts":http://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0184.html defines a way to ask for message delivery receipts
  NM-DWP-ISMB-001    Server-side archiving of messages is not part of the core protocol                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    "XEP-0136: Message Archiving":http://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0136.html defines mechanisms and preferences for the server-side archiving and retrieval of XMPP messages
  NM-USR-ISMB-005    Notifications involving user interaction                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              Those could be implemented by means of Ad-Hoc Commands; we might need to define special rules to cover these cases
  NM-DEV-FOKUS-101   XMPP allows, but does not force, stanzas to have a unique identifier                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  We could enforce this condition within Webinos
  NM-DEV-FOKUS-105   Sending XMPP stanzas to multiple recipients is not part of the core protocol                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          "XEP-0033: Extended Stanza Addressing":http://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0033.html defines a XEP that enables entities to include RFC822-style address headers within XMPP stanzas in order to specify multiple recipients or sub-addresses
  NM-DEV-FOKUS-107   The core protocol does not allow to efficiently transmit binary data                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  Use of "XEP-0065: SOCKS5 Bytestreams":http://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0065.html to establish out-of-band bytestreams and "XEP-0047: In-Band Bytestreams":http://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0047.html as a fallback when the former is not usable (or alternatively, "XEP-0260: Jingle SOCKS5 Bytestreams Transport Method":http://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0260.html and "XEP-0261: Jingle In-Band Bytestreams Transport Method":http://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0261.html if "XEP-0166: Jingle":http://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0166.html is preferred), while "XEP-0231: Bits of Binary":http://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0231.html can be used for small bits of binary data

#### Conclusions

XMPP is a very good candidate technology for handling event transmission over the network for Webinos: all of the requirements can be met by using already existing XEPs, maybe with tiny improvements, and with little effort in defining some Webinos-specific data types (i.e., event format and types), but this latter issue would be true of any other technology we might choose.

Furthermore, its extensibility and decentralization are extremely attractive features for our purposes.
