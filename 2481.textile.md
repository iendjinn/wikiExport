Platform specified
==================

[[UI_Navigation|UI-Widget: Navigation bar]]
------------------------------------------------

[[UI_Split|UI-Widget: Split view]]
---------------------------------------

[[UI_Font|Font-size increase on the TV]]
---------------------------------------------

The following section provides examples for the platform specified rules, which are injected into the WRT on application launch. Inside the manifest the app developer needs to specify, if the application is going to make use of the predefined UI adaptation work.

The platform specified rules extend the jQuery mobile framework and make use of the data-* attributes for DOM elements. As for now, for the use inside the vehicle as a input controller the BMW iDrive controller is assumed. The iDrive controller is mapped to the following inpute controllers from the Device Status API [1] jogDial and fourWayScroller. For the TV we assume that at least a fourWayController is supported.
