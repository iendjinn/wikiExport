Types of Application
====================

Table of definitions
--------------------

We define the following types of applications within webinos:

  ------------- ---------------- ----------------------- ------------------------- ----------------------- ------------------- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  _.Type   _.Runs in   _.Local / hosted   _.Widget Manifest?   _.Delivered over   _.Installed?   _.Authentication
  B-U           Browser          Hosted                  No                        HTTP or HTTPS           No                  None
  B-A           Browser          Hosted                  No                        HTTPS                   No                  TLS certificate, root trusted by browser
  W-R           Widget runtime   Combination             Yes                       File + HTTPS            Yes                 Signed widget authenticated by WRT. ‘Recognised’ as per "WAC specifications":http://specs.wacapps.net/core/#digital-signatures . HTTPS traffic only from recognised origin.
  W-U           Widget runtime   Combination             Yes                       File + HTTPS            Yes                 Signed widget, but unrecognised identity (see "WAC specifications":http://specs.wacapps.net/core/#digital-signatures ). HTTPS traffic only from recognised origin. HTTPS traffic authenticated by widget runtime OR connected to same entity as the widget signature.
  W-H           Widget runtime   Combination             Yes                       File + HTTP             Yes                 May be unauthenticated and download data from HTTP sources.
  ------------- ---------------- ----------------------- ------------------------- ----------------------- ------------------- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This is related to [[D036_Types_of_API|Types of API]].

In general, we expect that ‘B-U’ and ‘W-H’ categories will be deemed roughly equivalent.

It is also possible that we do not (in webinos specifications) outline any default settings for W-R, as we have not created the surrounding ecosystem to support it.

Browser-based applications
--------------------------

### Definition

-   Web content served as pages or from an app cache.
-   Execute in the browser

### Security perimeter

-   Origin - scheme, domain, port.

### Authentication

TLS/SSL certificates if present.

### Access to APIs

Mediated by the policy architecture.
Unauthenticated content may be unable to have access to some APIs, and settings may not persist.

Widgets
-------

### Definition

-   Widget Manifest + content
-   Downloaded in a zip file
-   May also be ‘hosted’ - acquiring content from the web
-   Executes in a widget runtime

### Security perimeter

-   Widget ID + recognised Origin (see WAC)

### Authentication

Widgets are signed as per W3C specifications on Widget signatures and packaging. Widgets may be self-signed.
Content from the web will come over HTTPS (except in the W-H category)

### Access to APIs

Mediated by the policy architecture.
Widgets with hosted content from non-HTTPS sources may have limited potential privileges and policies may not persist

Security discussion
-------------------

-   Difference in installation approach - widgets installed, browser-based apps aren’t.
-   Unauthenticated web content is worse than unauthenticated / self-signed widgets: not installed, and no integrity guarantee.
-   We’re not defining trusted or untrusted certificates
-   We should have a set of threats for each type of app?
