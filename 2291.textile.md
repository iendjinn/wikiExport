Webinos core interface
----------------------

### Overview of API

Link to API - http://dev.webinos.org/specifications/new/example.html

The webinos core interface is a way of accessing all the other interfaces.

### Threats

#### API-Specific threats and misuse cases

1.  Replacing this core interface with another, malicious core interface. This could access a different personal zone proxy, perhaps one that is not on the current device.

#### Implementation threats and possible attacks

1.  Are there any threats due to the way the webinos.js shim is implemented?

#### Threats to apps and developers using this API (E.g. Jimmy and Jessica)

1.  A developer has little assurance that the webinos object is communicating with the right endpoint.

#### Threats to device manufacturers, operators, other stakeholders

No obvious threats.

### Mitigations

1.  Ensure that the browser can only talk to the right PZP through authentication of the IPC / WebSocket.
