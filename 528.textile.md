Web Introducer investigation
============================

Introduction
------------

In this document, we will look at the state-of-the-art technologies "Web Introducer":http://web-send.org/ for service discovery.

The Web Introducer concept was initiated by Google. SEMC and Mozilla is cooperating with Google on the concept. The goal is to make the concept a W3C recommendation specification. Web Introducer enables web applications to discover a user’s personal resources, no matter where they are hosted or produced, and gain permission to interact with them via a one-click user interaction.

Web Introducer is a further development of "Powerbox" that was presented by Google to the W3C DAP WG in January 2010.

As the starting point, we define typical use cases. Based on the use cases, we will cover the following areas:
# Description of the Candidate Solution, i.e. the Web Introducer
# Gap Analysis between the existing solution with Discovery requirements of WebinOS
# Proposals to fill the Gap found in (3)

The output of this document shall contribute to architecture design.

Note that the "Web Intents":http://webintents.appspot.com/ has also been proposed as a state-of-the-art technology for service discovery. However, the author, also from Google, of Web Intents has, due to the overlaps with the Web Introducer, decided to focus his efforts on the Web Introducer project rather than supporting Web Intents further. See "So-what-is-happening-with-web-intents":http://paul.kinlan.me/so-what-is-happening-with-web-intents.

See the section Gap Analysis & Proposals

Work Scenarios - Use cases
--------------------------

-   A web application needs to access userâ€™s media resources, images, audio clips or video clips. The user selects from where the media resources should be fetched, from the userâ€™s account on a media sharing site, from the deviceâ€™s internal gallery or be dynamically created with the device camera or microphone, and approves that the web application can access the selected media resources. For an example see: http://semccustomer.appspot.com/

-   A user visits a news site and wants to share a link to an interesting article at a social web service. The user selects, from a list of social web services pre-registered by the user, the social web service to be used for sharing the link. For an example see: http://customer.web-send.org/

-   A medical web application needs access to data from a medical sensor, e.g. a blood glucose meter. The user approves that the web application can access a locally connected and pre-registered blood glucose meter.

Technical Details
-----------------

### Background

Today’s users have a great variety of personal resources beyond the files stored on their local computing device. Web sites maintain user collections of photos, email, contact information, documents, multimedia and other types of content. In addition to static content, Web sites also offer interactive resources such as discussion forums and event planning. The level of interactivity and personal data on the Web continues to increase. Today’s computing devices are also typically equipped with many sensors, such as a camera, microphone and GPS. These sensors enable quick creation of new resources.

Accordingly, resources could be hosted at many places, in the userâ€™s current device, in another device connected through the network, at a network server, or in a locally connected device. In such a resource rich environment, Web content might want to support interaction with other resources without advance knowledge of where these resources are hosted or how they are created.

### Mechanism Overview

The "Web Introducer":http://web-send.org/ enables web applications to discover a user’s personal _Resources_, no matter where they are hosted or how they are created, and gain permission to interact with them via a one-click user interaction. It is a user directed discovery/introduction mechanism to create a communication relation between a web application and a provider of a user resources, e.g. an image gallery, a social networking site account or the local device camera provider.

The concept is based on the following actors:

-   Customer: A web page that needs access to the user’s private resource. For example, it might be a social networking service that provides the option for the user to upload a profile image.

-   Provider: Web content that provides access to user’s Resources. For example, it might be a media sharing site such as Picasa, an in-device image gallery or the in-device camera provider.

-   Resource: Resource, at web site or in the computing device, provided by a Provider. Resources in the Web Introducer context are _data_, i.e. not HW. So for a device camera the resource is not the camera itself but the resources are the images and the video clips/streams provided by the camera. Other resources are for example media files at a network server, a bookmark, a message or sensor data.

-   Introducer: The part of a web user-agent (browser or widget engine) that intermediates an introduction to connect a Customer to a user selected Provider.

In order to make Resources available for Customers Providers must be registered within the Introducer. A media sharing site could for example offer the user to register his/her account so that the media will be available for other sites requesting media. A Provider could also be pre-registered. This applies for example to a local in-device media gallery or the in-device camera provider. The data types supported by the Provider and the URLs to access the data is saved by the Introducer.

When a Customer web page wants to access a Resource it performs an "introduction", in which it declares the requested data type(s). The user then selects a Provider among the registered Providers supporting thee requested data type(s) and a Provider web page is loaded into the browser. The "introduction" has been performed.

After a Customer web page has been introduced to a Provider web page then the pages communicate through HTML5 Web Messaging postMessage events. This allows documents to communicate with each other regardless of their source domain through message strings. The format/APIs etc of communication is not defined by Web Introducer so this must be defined by other API/protocol specifications. An example of such a protocol and API is the "Bookmark Introducer":http://web-send.org/bookmark/.

Note that a Customer and a Provider can be anonymous to each other.

### Sequence Diagrams

In the sequence diagrams below the pre-requisite is that the web browser is "Web Introducer-enabled", either through a native implementation (preferred) or through a downloable JavaScript library.

Prior to allowing _Customers_, i.e. web applications, access to content _Providers_ users must register selected _Providers_:

1.  User visits page that offers _Provider_ registration
2.  User selects to register one or more _Providers_ of required data types and clicks on the link to register the _Provider_
3.  The _Provider_ Registrant may perform a lower level of device/service discovery, e.g. XMPP, UPnP, Bluetooth discovery etc, based on the type of _Resource_ (or Service) supported by the _Provider_.
4.  The _Provider_ Registrant downloads a web page that contains a call to the _introducer.register_ method of the Web Introducer API to store meta data, e.g. id, description, list of supported data types and URL to access the data, about the registered _Providers_

Provider registration sequence diagram below:

![](Web_Introducer_Provider_registration_scenario.png)

The sequence when a _Customer_, i.e. Web Application, gets access to _Provider_ resources is:

1.  User accesses a Web Applicaion, _Customer_, that needs access to a certain type of _Resource_(Service)
2.  The _Customer_ web page contains a call to the _introducer.introduce_ method of the Web Introducer API to request access to a user selected _Resource Provider_
3.  The browser presents a menu of registered _Providers_ supporting the requested data type(s) and user selects a _Provider_
4.  The browser downloads a web page from the _Provider_ and opens the page in an iframe or a new window allowing the user to interact with the _Provider_
5.  The _Provider_ web page contains a call to the _introducer.welcome_ method of the Web Introducer API to establish an HTML Web Messaging communication relation between the _Customer_ and the _Provider_
6.  Optional lower level device/service discovery, e.g. XMPP, UPnP, Bluetooth discovery, and communication needed to access the physical device and/or the requested _Resource_/service is performed by the _Provider_
7.  Communication between the _Customer_ and the _Provider_ through HTML5 Web Messaging, postMessage events takes place

### Example Use cases in more detail

Looking at the use cases mentioned earlier in more detail:

*Access to user’s media resource, e.g. an image:*

A Web Application needs an image selected by the user and states â€œI need a resource of type â€œimageâ€ â€, through a Web Introducer API. The user has registered two providers:

-   A image sharing web site provider
-   A local device camera provider

If the user selects the image sharing web site provider this provider allows the user to login to the image sharing web site in order to select an image, which is then provided to the requesting web application.

If the user selects the camera provider this provider activates the local camera and allows the user to take a picture that is provided to the requesting web application.

My simple prototype illustrates this use case: "Web Introducer Image sharing example":http://semccustomer.appspot.com/. Run in Chrome or Firefox 3.6. (Firefox 4 does not by some strange reason work). If you want to test camera access run in Android 2.2 or later and install the local web server that provides access to the local camera.

*Share link*

A web application wants to give the user the possibility to share some content on the site, e.g. an interesting article, with a social web service that is selected by the user. The user has registered providers for the social web services, e.g. Twitter, Facebook and Buzz, the user wants to allowing sharing with. After the user has selected the social web services this provider allows the user to login to the service and share the link to the article. The following example illustrates this use case: "Web Introducer share link example":http://customer.web-send.org/.

*Access to medical sensor*

A Web Application for diabetics needs access to blood glucose values from the userâ€™s blood glucose meter and states â€œI need a resource of type â€œblood glucose meterâ€ â€, through a Web Introducer API. The user has registered two providers:

-   A small and portable Bluetooth Low Energy enabled blood glucose meter provider
-   An advanced internet-connected high precision home blood glucose meter provider

If the user selects the portable Bluetooth Low Energy enabled blood glucose meter the provider performs BT discovery and communication and the measured values are provided to the requesting web application.

If the user selects the internet-connected high precision home blood glucose meter the provider performs discovery and communication by some method and the measured values are provided to the requesting web application.

*Accordingly:*
* The requesting web application does not need to be aware of any low level discovery/communication details. It just states the type of resource/service it needs access to.
* Each resource/service provider implements the low level discovery and communication that is needed for the resource/service it provides.
* When a web application needs access to a resource/service the user selects the provider to use from the list of providers the user has registered.

### Standardization

The latest version of the Web Introducer predecessor Powerbox was submitted to W3C DAP WG on May 26 2010. See"Powerbox submission 20100526":http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-device-apis/2010May/0133.html.

Web Introducer has not yet been submitted to W3C and it is currently not clear if the proposal will be driven within the DAP WG or in any other WG.

### Implementation

It is possible to implement the needed functionality without requiring modifications to the web browser, i.e. the functionality can be implemented as a JavaScript library. See http://code.google.com/p/webintroducer/. However, a native browser implementation will provide better usability and security and there are experiments with a native Chrome and possibly also Firefox implementation.

### Issues

-   Not defined how resource data types should be globally unique. See http://web-send.org/introducer/#coordinate.
-   Associated with each data type the protocol /API for communication between Customer and Provider must be defined. Google has specified the first data type and protocol for sharing bookmarks: "Bookmark Introducer specification":http://web-send.org/bookmark/.
-   Usability is an issue. It could be difficult for users to understand the model. Could the UI be improved, for example by using tabs for the different providers? Could provider registration be automated?

Comparison analysis on the candidate solution
---------------------------------------------

|**Technology**|**Implementations**|**Integrate with browser**|**Network structure - central point required?**|**More comparing criteria…**|
|"Web Introducer":http://web-send.org/|Currently there is an experimental pure "HTML+JS implementation":http://code.google.com/p/webintroducer/ of the Web Introducer API that works in currently deployed modern browsers. Experimental applications are:
- "Share Link":http://customer.web-send.org/
- "Get image":http://semccustomer.appspot.com/ |Yes, browser just inludes a JS library. However, for better usability and security a native or plug-in browser implementation is probably needed. |Probably, the Web Introducer currently maintains the site https://webintroducer.net/ that maintains userâ€™s registered Providers.||

Gap Analysis & Proposals
------------------------

In the table below on Discovery & Addressing requirements relevant for Service discovery are analyzed.

|**Requirement**|**Gap**|**Proposed Solution**|
|DA-DEV-SEMC-001
Webinos SHALL provide means for a Service to Expose its availability and capabilities on a Webinos Network.|Web Introducer provides means for Services to expose its capabilities, i.e. supported data types. However, the Web Introducer is agnostic to the underlaying bearers used to access local or remote resources so there is currently no mechanism in the Introducer itself to expose the availability of a Service|Extend the functionality that maintains userâ€™s registered Providers with means to detect availability |
|DA-DEV-SEMC-002
Webinos SHALL provide the means to discover new services advertised on a Webinos Network.|Should this requirement be fulfilled by the discovery mechanism or is this an application feature?||
|DA-DEV-SEMC-003
Upon detection of a new service Webinos SHALL be able to install new software resources or application resources needed to interwork with the new service based on the Service Description.|Probably no gaps. Providers can provide links to software resources or application resources needed to interwork with the new service||
|DA-DEV-SEMC-004
Webinos SHALL provide means for an Application to detect the availability of a service. |See DA-DEV-SEMC-001||
|DA-DEV-SEMC-005
Webinos SHALL provide means for an Application to find devices and services that are available on a Webinos network, based on the Device and Service Description.|Only Service discovery is supported||
|DA-DEV-SEMC-006
Webinos SHALL provide means for an Application to find devices and services in close proximity of the device |Only Service discovery is supported. Currently proximity status is not supported|Extend the Provider meta data and the Introduction request with proximity data|
|DA-DEV-SEMC-007
Webinos SHALL provide means for an Application to find devices and services based on the physical location of the device. |Only Service discovery is supported. Currently physical location is not a search criteria.|Extend the Provider meta data and the Introduction request with physical location data|
|DA-DEV-ISMB-001
Webinos SHALL provide means for applications to discover and address features and services available on devices owned by the user even if such devices are not directly connected to the device on which the application is running.|This would work. It is a question on how Providers are made available for registration.||
|DA-USR-ISMB/FHG-005
Webinos SHALL provide means for applications to discover and address applications and services offered by other users. |This would work. It is a question on how Providers are made available for registration.||
