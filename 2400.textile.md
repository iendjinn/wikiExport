Introduction: overview of approaches
====================================

{{toc}}

The purpose of this chapter is to briefly describe proposed techniques or solutions that could help with a "write once, run anywhere" approach to the UI layer of an app; to be cross-platform right from the start - the client-side code decides what to show and how - based on device’s capabilities/resources. The main problems are:
* wide range of resolutions (or even lack of screen)
* different hardware resources (e.g. camera) that need their UI components
* various user input methods

Declarative UI Description
--------------------------

A separate language would be introduced to describe components on a page; this language would then be interpreted during run-time by the app taking into consideration what the device is capable of and generating the required HTML/JS code. Typically a language of that kind is a XML dialect, but a there’s also a possibility to use for example JSON (see Clutter’s example here: http://docs.clutter-project.org/docs/clutter-cookbook/1.0/script-ui.html). The whole purpose of it would be to hide the specific implementations from the developer, so he could concentrate on the actual UI building. Main problem with this solution is the need to write our own interpeters, which not only adds overhead, but also takes more memory/disk space.

### XUL

XUL is a user interface markup language developed by Mozilla. Being a dialect of XML it is of course cross-platform.

**Features**:

-   Widgets and Controls:
    -   Box Model
    -   Buttons, Menus, Trees, Input boxes
    -   Content widgets - browser, iframe and editor
-   Templates - allow separation of data from the presentation layer via RDF datasource files
-   mature (over 10 years)
-   the XUL itself is easy to learn
-   ability to test the app without installing any additional software except for Firefox

JS-based framework
------------------

At first glance a pure HTML + JS solution seems like a perfect solution for modern devices (out-of-box support), given a closer inspection though many problems arise - the amount of webkit variants for the Android-based devices alone is overwhelming, as well as the distinct troubles they could give. And that’s just one family of products. That’s where the JS-based frameworks step in - usually an amalgam of pure HTML + it’s extensions (like "data-role" in JQuery Mobile) and components created by JavaScript (JoshFire Framework).

### "jQueryMobile":http://jquerymobile.com/

**Cross-platform & cross-device**: Instead of writing unique apps for each mobile device or OS, the jQuery mobile framework will allow you to design a single highly branded and customized web application that works on all platforms. It is feasible to use JQuery Framework since it supports iOS, Windows Phone, Android

**Touch-optimized layouts & UI widgets**: Dynamic touch interfaces that will adapt to a range of devices, the system will include both layouts (lists, detail panes, overlays) and a rich set of form controls and UI widgets (toggles, sliders, tabs).

**CSS framework**: To have the power to design full applications. support for more CSS3 properties.

**jQuery Mobile**: Touch-Optimized Web Framework for Smartphones & Tablets A unified user interface system across all popular mobile device platforms, Provides lightweight code that is built with progressive enhancement.
* jQuery Mobile event handling, Methods and Utilities, Data attribute reference and Theme Framework [1]
* jQuery Mobile UI - The UI is declared by using HTML 5 style "data-role". This makes the UI development a breeze. Building a prototype of jQuery Mobile UI (wireframe) would not require any coding, but just html tags.

**jQuery Mobile API**: Consists Page Loading, Transition, Dialog box handling, List View manipulation, item click and so on [2].

**Code Example**:

-   Include needed Javascript and CSS

<pre>
<head>

<link rel="stylesheet" href="/jquery.mobile-1.0a1.min.css" />
<script src="jquery-1.4.3.min.js"></script>
<script src="jquery.mobile-1.0a1.min.js"></script>

</head>
</pre>

-   Declare different Pages, Header and Navigation

<pre>
<body>

<div data-role="page" id="home">
 …..
 </div>

<div data-role="page" id="search">
 …..
 </div>

<div data-role="page" id="recent">
 …..
 </div>

</body>
</pre>

**jQuery mobile handling the Issues**:

-   Scrollbar issues - to start below header and end above footer [3]
-   Header and Footer issues to be fixed [3]

### "iUI - User Interface (UI) Framework for WebApp development":http://www.iui-js.org/

iUI is a framework consisting of a JavaScript library, CSS, and images for developing advanced mobile webapps. Made with only iPhone in mind in the first place (reason of i UI), now supports most smartphones & tablets.

**iUI has the following features**:

-   Create Navigational Menus and iPhone-style interfaces from standard HTML
-   Use or knowledge of JavaScript is not required to create modern mobile web pages
-   Ability to handle phone orientation changes
-   Provide a more "iPhone-like" experience in your Web apps

**Lightweight**:

iUI doesn’t come with dozens of transitions styles or hundreds of built-in UI elements like you can find in bigger frameworks like JQueryMobile or Sencha. And this is on purpose. Since iUI wants keep core code as lightweight as possible [4].

**HTML Markup**:

-   iUI is just plain HTML, CSS and Javascript.
-   No compilation, no code generation, no alteration [4].

### "qooxdoo Mobile":http://qooxdoo.org/

qx.Mobile is qooxdoo’s mobile framework. It provides specific UI classes for touch devices, handling of mobile events like swiping, and specific styling. It is suitable for various mobile web browsers on iOS and Android platforms.

**Features** [5]

-   Mobile widget set
-   Theming via CSS and LESS
-   iOS theme
-   Android theme
-   Touch events: touchstart, touchmove, touchend, touchcancel
-   Gesture events: swipe, tap
-   Animations between pages
-   Touch event emulation for debugging in desktop browsers
-   Fixed toolbars and momentum scrolling via iScroll
-   Basic PhoneGap support

**Development**:

**Mobile and tablet switch, Tablet support out of the box**: It provides a detection of device type the application runs on. Based upon this distinction the page manager navigation pages are optimized for device class mobile

**To get device type and enable device-based layouting**: The device type is accessible by the environment variable ‘device.type’

The device-based layouting is handled by qx.ui.mobile.page.Manager.

**Example**:

<pre>
var isTablet = false;
var manager = new qx.ui.mobile.page.Manager(isTablet);
var page = new qx.ui.mobile.page.NavigationPage();
manager.addDetail(page);
page.show();
</pre>

The manager has an optional constructor parameter isTablet. It indicates whether the page manager uses the mobile or the tablet layouting mode. In this examples, It shows the deactivated tablet layout mode with isTablet=false. If parameter isTablet is not defined at constructor, the page manager always calls environment variable device.type to determine the layout mode. Tablet layout mode is active by default, if environment variable is desktop or tablet [5].

**page manager arrange pages and layout modes**: There are 3 different layouting modes that ‘qx.ui.mobile.page.Manager’ offers [5].

-   Mobile Layout
-   Tablet Landscape Layout
-   Tablet Portrait Layout

**Example**:

<pre>
var manager = new qx.ui.mobile.page.Manager();

var masterPage = new qx.ui.mobile.page.NavigationPage();
var detailPage1 = new qx.ui.mobile.page.NavigationPage();
var detailPage2 = new qx.ui.mobile.page.NavigationPage();

manager.addMaster(masterPage);
manager.addDetail([detailPage1,detailPage2]);

masterPage.show();
detailPage1.show();
</pre>

**Theming**

-   CSS and LESS: Theming in qooxdoo mobile is done with LESS and CSS. LESS is an extension for CSS to enable style sheets to be more dynamic. In LESS you can you use variables, reuse CSS statement inside of CSS file, import CSS files and create mixins [5].

For example the LESS mixin for border-radius:

<pre>
.border-radius() {
 -webkit-border-radius: `arguments;
    -moz-border-radius: `arguments;
 border-radius: @arguments;
}
</pre>

This mixin helps you creating border-radius for most browsers, just by writing something like:

<pre>
.border-radius(4px);
</pre>

### "Joshfire Framework":http://framework.joshfire.com

**What does it have to offer**:

-   JavaScript framework
-   clear separation of data from UI (Data Tree, which is also sort of a router from what i reckon; and UI Tree, where you declare components and bind them to data sources)
-   underscore.js templates
-   event driven; callbacks
-   native [not 100% sure on that] or at least aimed-at-a-specific-device components (for example iScroll) via adapters: "For instance playing a video can be made with the HTML5 <video> element in some browsers, with Flash in older browsers, with Java on Android and with vendor-specific APIs on connected TVs."
-   "Write once, run everywhere" philosophy with more adapters planned
-   Phonegap support

**Currently supported adapters**:
* Web Browsers
**** Internet Explorer 6+
**** Firefox 3.5+

**** Arduino: Control apps from hardware through Arduinos and websockets.

**Experimental adapters**:
* Kinect: Provides either fake mouse pointer bound to nearest finger or generic gestures. Prototype based on DepthJS, must port to newer SDKs.
* Sencha: More complete but slower than our iOS/Android adapters. May be useful for some advanced UI elements, but beware of performance and licensing terms.

**Future adapters**:
* Boxes: Boxee, Roku, ISP set-top boxes, …
* Mobile OSes: Blackberry, WebOS, Bada, …
* Connected TVs: LG, Philips, Toshiba, Loewe, …
* Connected Objects Anything the future may bring! ;-)
