PZH key storage
===============

{{toc}}

Overview
--------

The PZH Farm holds CA keys for each personal zone hub it hosts. Keys must be stored and protected from theft or misuse. This page documents suggestions for a PZH Farm deployment profile for how keys could be stored and protected. This suggestion would be non-normative, but is of interest to anyone deploying a PZH Farm.

The Threats and Attacks.
------------------------

The PZH CA keys can be misused in the following ways:

-   To create a new, malicious device within the user’s personal zone and potentially access all of the user’s data and resources
-   To create a malicious device and impersonate the end user
-   To create a new, fake personal zone for the user as a means of impersonation and targetting attacks on the user’s friends and contacts
-   To revoke devices as a denial or service (or attack on reputation) on the end user

It is important to differentiate the _use_ of the PZH Key and _posession_ of the PZH Key. Use is bad - it could sign an arbitrary certificate - but theft is worse. Use can be identified through logging and auditing. Theft cannot.

The threat of insider attack (e.g. a malicious employee at the PZH Farm provider) is not considered. This is a much harder threat to mitigate.

### Attack Trees

TODO.

### Compromising the PZH

Is there any point in protecting the PZH CA keys more rigorously than the PZH Farm itself? If an attacker can compromise the PZH, they can intercept all traffic and probably steal all user data anyway.

Points:

-   Compromising the PZH will give attackers access to any data stored on the PZH, as well as the ability to request access to data on the users’ devices. The full impact of this attack will depend on the user’s awareness (expected low), policies (which can be modified by the compromised PZH, but will they be updated on PZPs?), and any intrusion detection system we develop.
-   Compromising a PZH just provides a window of access, and therefore the attacker would have to frequently revisit the compromised PZH or install malware to maintain their access to the system. This could potentially be recovered from if detected, and ought to be easier to detect. Theft of keys is a one-shot event that is hard to recover from unless detected, and then causes a lot of difficulties for all users.

In summary: it’s probably not worth spending **too much** effort on protecting the keys compared to the platform, but they definitely **are** more important and we should consider how they might be protected.

### Attacker personas to consider.

-   Frankie might attempt to compromise the PZH Farm. Probably just to cause mischief, or as a targeted attack on a particular person he knows. He’s most likely to try and use well-known system vulnerabilities based on scripts he has found online, or guess the password of a user to get to their web interface.
-   Ethan is capable of exploiting the PZH farm. He’s most interested in finding user data and installing malware. He is worried about being caught, so stealing keys and then leaving the host might be attractive to him. He may want to install a botnet on the host itself, or use stolen keys to try and remotely install software on all the devices belonging to users of that PZH Farm. As the PZH wont hold any credit card details (we assume) it is not, in itself, a particularly interesting attack beyond follow-on attacks on the larger network.
-   Gary might want to compromise a PZH hosted at a company in order to make the company look bad. Theft of user data and keys would make this attack better. He’s not necessarily that careful, so some kind of intrusion detection would help catch him. However, he probably does have privileged access to every system, so isolation and access conrol wont.
-   Harold, David and Irwin seem relatively unlikely attackers at the moment.

CA key constraints
------------------

The CA keys must be accessible from the PZH in order to add new or revoke devices from the personal zone. Availability and performance is not that important - they will be used very rarely - but they must be available on demand. Of particular importance is their ability to sign CRLs and revoke devices.

Potential Solutions
-------------------

### Storing CA keys unprotected

The most simple solution would be what we have now - no protection is provided for the CA keys. They are stored on the PZH server in plain text, and we rely on the security of the platform to prevent unauthorised access.

**Advantages**
No work needed. Easy to

**Disadvantages**
Theft and misuse of keys possible for any successful remote attacker.

### Slight improvement: separating CA keys and CRL signing keys

One improvement would be to separate the CA key from the CRL signing key. While CRL signing keys can be misused to perform denial of service attacks, this is not as valuable an attack (potentially) and arguably of less interest to attackers. Furthermore, a malicious CRL could be deleted relatively easily. CRL keys are also arguably more important to have available on the PZH Farm, as they are needed to revoke devices when lost or stolen, which is a considerable threat.

Therefore, CRL keys could be left relatively unprotected and CA keys could be better protected with less impact on other mitigations.

The only disadvantage is that it requires some extra work on the implementation.

### Storing CA keys on a different host to the PZH Farm and web server

While the CA key must be available to the PZH Farm, it does not necessarily have to be hosted there. For example, a separate internal server could offer an internal "sign(keyid, certificate)" function, returning a signed certificate using the requested keyid. This means that compromising the PZH Farm would allow an attacker to create signed certificates, but would not allow theft of the CA key, as it would reside on a different platform (in theory - this relies on the other platform being better protected. This might be the case as the second platform could have a much better protected OS and minimal TCB). The separate platform could also be rate-limited, preventing too many certificates being issued too often, as an intrusion detection mechanism. It would also be able to log the results in a protected manner.

**Advantages**
Protects against theft, assuming the second host is better protected. Might provide logging and intrusion detection

**Disadvantages**
Requires an additional host. Does not prevent misuse.

### Storing CA keys in trusted hardware

Possibly the best solution is to use a TPM on the host to store CA keys. Because TPM keys cannot leave the TPM, they are inaccessible even if the platform is completely compromised. However, they can still offer a similar "sign(keyid, data)" function, making the keys useful.

**Advantages**
Requires no additional host server, keys are very well protected. Also mitigates some insider attack problems. Could be combined with malware identification.

**Disadvantages**
Requires some work on backup and recovery. Mandates a certain piece of hardware. Slow. Does not prevent misuse or provide much logging.

### Storing CA keys encrypted using a user-held password.

If we introduced a password into the user experience of webinos, the CA keys could be encrypted with this password. This means that a remote attacker would need to do more work to compromise keys, as theft of keys would still require decryption. Even if one password was compromised, this would not result in loss of all CA keys.

**Advantages**
Protects each key individually. Requires no new hardware or separate hosts. The password could be reused for other things, such as local storage.

**Disadvantages**
Requires users to have (and remember) a password. It also requires a recovery mechanism in case the password is lost. Passwords provide relatively weak protection from offline attacks, and passwords are commonly weak. Breaks our current model and principles of not creating new authenticators.

### Storing keys in the OS KeyStore mechanism (E.g. Gnome Keyring)

OS-provided key storage could be used. This might provide more protection for keys.

**Advantages**
We already have most of the code. Requires no new software/hardware.

**Disadvantages**
Dubious usefulness. Keystores are generally unlocked by users, but the PZH Farm is a server without a local user. How is the keystore protected? This doesn’t seem to make much sense. Even if this added user-separation to the key storage (e.g. requiring root access) privilege escalation is trivial in most systems, and it would need the PZH Farm to run as root.
