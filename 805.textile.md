The form and representation of the context model in webinos
===========================================================

The context-awareness scope
---------------------------

The scope of providing context-awareness in to webinos applications is three-fold:

1.  To provide context-awareness support for any webinos application
2.  To obtain secure access to context information through user-negotiated policies
3.  To be able to transform various multi-media formats for web content

The extent of modelling and representing context for webinos is therefore to identify the most suitable form and notation to represent the webinos context model in such a way that a range of any webinos applications literally can start using the context-awareness support provided by the webinos platform and runtime in a secure way. The following four sub-sections summarise the identified context-awareness requirements:

### Context-awareness support for webinos applications

The context-awareness support in webinos will allow applications to:

-   Obtain the current device context.
-   Listen to events occurring on the device.
-   Discover other devices nearby.
-   Share context information across devices.
-   Share application context across devices, so that the user can continue the session on another device.
-   Trigger events across applications and devices based on a change in the current context.
-   Store and retrieve context information related to both current and future situations.
-   Scan for, discover, address, and maintain connections to wireless networks and devices in the environment — including for Bluetooth, Wifi, Near Field Communication, and 3G.
-   Listen for specific contextual changes on a device.
-   Retrieve device features.
-   Ask the system for the current application context.
-   Ask for the current device context on the target device where the application is or will be executed.
-   Obtain social proximity of webinos devices and users.
-   Set priorities on events based on the current device context.
-   Obtain device information including: device identity, installed applications, running applications, active applications, connected devices status, connection history, connectivity status, power information, CPU load, system temperature, audio and video codec capabilities, memory status, output devices (display etc) characteristics, output devices (touch screen, keyboard etc) characteristics.
-   Identify, store, retrieve and communicate context that is private for an application.
-   Identify and store context information that is specific for the device.
-   Identify and store context information for the current situation in which an application is executed.
-   Identify and store (under a universal social data format) context information on activities that create a relationship/connection among different entities (i.e. device with another device, application with another application).

### Secure access to context information through user-negotiated policies

The context-awareness package will be secured by access control functions provided by a policy manager, The policy manager will provide for some of the access security for context information, by allowing the permitted applications to:

-   Access context information about the user, the device and the application.
-   Inform the user about context and personal information that is shared by applications. This is with the exception of context information that is private for the application itself.
-   Provide access control for context structures with user-defined policies.
-   Securely store associations between device, user and context information and provide this information based on user preferences.
-   Implement the privacy policies that the user and the application negotiate between them.
-   Register their intent to access context information provided by the underlying webinos platform, given that the user permits the access to this context information originating from the webinos platform.
-   Ensure the security and integrity of any context information that is privately created and stored by the application, so that attackers and users can not tamper with the stored or shared context information.
-   Ensure that the user is offered the possibility to understand and control the access to context information originating from the underlying webinos system for all applications that registers an intent.
-   Set context information as public, shared, or private.
-   Negotiate with the user about accessing context information originating from the webinos platform through explicitly using the names of context attributes.

### Transform various multi-media formats for web content

Devices in general does not support all available file formats for transcoding various multi-media formats. The result is that some files can not be viewed in some devices, but if the content is presented on another device it will show. Context information can be used to identify what file types and codec support that a device has. After obtaining this information, an application will sometimes need to transform/ transcode the content into a new file or media stream. The following support will be provided by the webinos plaftorm, related to the context-awareness functions:

-   Check device compatibility with certain file formats.
-   Provide embedded mechanisms that transform file formats.
-   Support the integration of external content adaptation services.
-   Use device context and user context as means to adapt the delivery and presentation of content.
-   Use context information for pushed content to trigger the installation of the correct application in case the application is not yet installed on the device that is receiving the pushed content.

### Managing the context-awareness in webinos

The Context Manager is responsible for the management of contexts for the webinos platform and webinos applications. With management we mean identifying, organising, sensing, capturing, storing, sharing, and protecting the context information. An important aspect of this is the ability of the platform and applications to subscribe to and listen to changes and updates of context information. In the case of sharing of context information across multiple devices, the Context Manager also provides the possibility to share context information with remote Context Managers. It is responsible to store the following context information elicited from the requirements:

-   User context
-   Device context
-   Application context
-   Social context

It is possible to compose and merge context information from various contexts into new context instances. The publicity, privacy, and negotiability of context information is also considered key to achieve security and integrity context information that is created and stored by the Context Manager. It is also possible to implement application metrics and analytics by using the Context Manager.

The context management approach in webinos is meant to be open-ended where both the platform and applications can create and organise context data.

What is a context model?
------------------------

A model in general can be described as a systematic description of an object or phenomenon that shares important characteristics with the object or phenomenon. It can be seen as a representation of relevant/ important aspects of the target object or phenomenon that is being described.

A context describes aspects of a situation seen from an actor/ entity’s point of view. From such a viewpoint, context modelling in webinos becomes the process of sensing and gathering context information to help enhance the quality and usefulness of the application. A context model is the result of the context modelling. The approach in webinos, is to define a very methodical way of handling context information. We believe this will be important for application developers to be able to add context-awareness to their application to benefit from it. In this section, we present the foundations for representing context information in webinos applications. It is based on a review of existing litterature in the field, including some EU-projects that have been working with context-aware applications and services. It is also based on some of the webinos partners existing experience in the field.

### Relating context to how humans sense, think, and act

Our human mind is episodic in nature. We remember artefacts, objects, people, and information easier if we are able to remember/ recall aspects of the situation in which we experienced the entities in. Not only do we organise our thoughts and remember in an eposidic way, also our human communication is full of associations and references to past, present, future and imaginative/dreamt situations. Our cogntion helps us to perceive, remember, recall, reason, and act. In neuro-science and psychology one distinctinguishes between episodic and semantic memory - see for instance Tulving (1972). Consider how we reflect upon printed magazines in a book section; We might remember them according to the front cover, an article, some photo we saw inside it, the title of an article, a person in a picture, or the place we read the magazine. Some of these â€˜triggersâ€™ can be difficult to capture, and record.

Context-aware systems are to some extent trying to mimic this kind of cognitive behaviour based on sensing, thinking, and acting in the situation. If a living organism is acting well within a situation, then one would typically say that the organism is adapting well to that situation. The notion of adaptivity is therefore related to context-aware systems. Remembering context in a software program is therefore about creating a facility that stores the episodic information captured in the situation.

### Definition of context

There are many definitions of context. This is due to research in the topic within computer science, information science, and artificial intelligence.

Context is much related to the notion of a situation. In some languages the words ‘situation’ and ‘context’ are being used to describe each other. For instance, "it is not the right situation for this yet" could easily be rephrased to "at the moment the context is not right for this" and mean almost the same. For our work, we will use the following definitions: Situations exist in the real world. There are actors/ entities involved in situations. A situation endures over a period of time. This is true whether the time is referred to as a point in time, an hour, a day, at night, in the summer, and so on. We define context as a description of the aspects of a situation.

In this way, a context captures important aspects of a situation. This means that someone has decided which particular aspects that are more important/ matters more than others. Context therefore is an explicit representation of a situation. Capturing context information can therefore be compared with taking a snapshot of a situation, where only the most important things are being developed into the preserved "photo" (ref context).

The following figure depicts the relations between situations, context data, and entities. An entity may be any person, thing, or system that is being active or passive for that situation.

<div class="uml">

Entity "involves **" — "is within**" Situation
Situation "describes aspects of a" — "is represented by **" Context


</div>

h3. Which entity is the context for?

In litterature and in technical implementations there are many different types of contexts mentioned. In general, it can be observed that context means something different for the researchers and the application developers. The naming of the context depends quite much on the entity or actor the context is intended for. When sharing, debating, and reasoning about context, because of its dependency on time, people often discuss how context changes over time. This means that in webinos the naming of contexts will reflect the actor/entity that is involved in the situation as the subject:

** Contexts that describes aspects of a user’s situations are referred to as user contexts.
* Contexts that describes aspects of an application’s situations are referred to as application contexts.
* Contexts that describes aspects of a device’s situations are referred to as device contexts.
* Contexts that describes aspects of a user’s social situations are referred to as social contexts. A social context is for this reason considered to be sub-part of a user context.

In webinos, these four kinds of contexts have been referred to in the user stories, use cases, and requirements. In terms of inheritance diagram, these four identified types of contexts can be depicted in UML as:

<div class="uml">

Context <|— UserContext
Context <|— ApplicationContext
Context <|— DeviceContext
Context <|— SocialContext

</div>
Please note that a social context is part of a user context, but that we have not depicted this in this inheritance diagram. We will come back to this composition relation (i.e. a part-of relation) in another UML diagram below.

Context representation in webinos
---------------------------------

### Adressing the needs of each application and the platform

Since the purpose is to enable any application to be context-aware, there will be a wide variety of needs for representing context information in webinos. Some of these needs will be invividual for each application. The context-awareness support therefore would need to cater for all these demands as means to be sufficiently generic.

This is because context information that is relevant for one application will most likely not be relevant for another application. Secondly, context information that is individually created and maintained by one application will need data integrity, and should not be taken out of context nor modified by another application.

The exception to this is when the context information originates from the webinos platform itself - for instance from a location sensor. In such cases, since context information is generated by the underlying platform, and it can be personally sensitive, applications will need to negotiate their consent with the user to access this kind of context information.

### Structured vs. unstructured context information

Having analysed multiple system approaches to modelling and representing context, we have identified two main approaches for the representation of context:

1.  Structured context information
2.  Unstructured context information

Unstructured context information can be thought of as a collection of attributes or properties that have not been classified or categorised in a data structure. For example the phrases "in the city, tomorrow, meeting, Helen, Alice" is considered unstructured context information. Text queries to a web search engine can be viewed as unstructured context information. This approach is very suitable when it is difficult to define a context structure due to the absence of data structures.

On the other hand, a structured approach to representing context information reflects a view that it is desirable to have some consistency and stability in the representation, categorisation, and expression of attributes and relations. Context information have been represented as tree structures, property lists, arrays, semantic networks, graphs and so on. These context structures can either be static or dynamic. A light weight way of representing structured context information is the use of a list of property-value pairs. With property-value pairs, we mean the same as attribute-value pairs.

Here are two examples of such a light weight representations of context information:

1.  "color=pink, interior=light-beige, buyer=Peter, car=BMW".
2.  "location=home, orientation=vertical, device=Experia Neo, time=yesterday".

In webinos, we have chosen to represent context as a hierarchical tree-based representations of situations. The first reason for this is that tree-structures can be mathematically proven to be a list of elements. The second rationale is that unstructured information can always be represented in a structure. With this is we gain the possibility to categorise and sub-categorise the context information where unstructured information is just categorised in one category. This gives the developer community the opportunity to better organise and group context information together, and to also handle unstructured context information if needed.

### The context strucure in webinos

The class diagram below shows core of all webinos context structures. A context has attributes with values. One can also add relations with other entities. A context has:

-   Name
-   Privacy
-   Attributes

A context can consist of sub-contexts to better group attributes together, although this would not be needed if there are few context attributes. The below class diagram for context information can described with: context can consist of several sub-contexts, and a context can be part of another context. A context will always comprise one or more attributes.

<div class="uml">

Context o— "*" Context : can be part of
Context **— "*" Attribute
Context "*" — "*" Entity : can be related to
Attribute o— ValueRange
Attribute o— ValueSet


class Context {
+ Name: String
+ Privacy: int
}

class Attribute {
+ Name: String
+ Value: DataPrimitive
}

</div>
Each context attribute has a name and a value. The type of the context attribute is a data primitive (e.g. Boolean, integer, float, double, or string). In many cases it will be sufficient to just use string as the data type for a context attribute.

However, it is not always needed to have attributes at the top-levels of the context if the top-level context consists of several sub-contexts. In this case, the attributes of the sub-contexts qualify the top-level context to be a context in its own right. This approach to organise contexts information allows for making meaningful contexts without including attributes at the top-level context - as long as there are attributes at the bottom level contexts in the structure.

The benefit of this, is that chunks of context attributes can be copied from one context instance to another. For example, if a device context contains a location attribute, one can copy this entire attribute for in the user context structure. This makes the reuse of context information across context instances effective.

h3. Attributes can have value sets and ranges

In some cases it is desirable to constrain the possible values for specific attributes. It is desirable on these cases to achieve this through the use of finite value sets or ranges. For instnace, an attribute with name="Capitol", type=string, could be constrained to the values = {"London", "Edinburgh", "Berlin", "Rome", "Madrid", "Istanbul", "Paris", "Athens", "Warsaw"}.

Here are some examples of value ranges:
** [10, 1000], (integer)
* [0.1, 0.12>, (float)
* <-1.0, 1.0>, (complex)
* [false, true], (Boolean)
* [June 1 2010, Aug 31 2010], (date)
* [**], (integer)

Here are some examples of value sets:
** {"Cyan", "Magenta", "Yellow"}, (string)
* {"None", "Little", "Medium", "High"}, (string)
* {"A2", "A3", "A4", "A5"}, (string)
* {10, 15, 20, 25}, (integer)
* {false, true}, (Boolean)
* {Jun 1 2012, Feb 1 2012}, (date)
* {*}, (string)

The data primitive of the value (i.e. type) are indicated in brackets.

h2. User context model in webinos

The following user context model describes aspects of a situation seen from the user’s point of view (Myrhaug and Goker, 2003). This is proposed as a framework for exploiting user contexts within and across application domains. We believe this to be a comprehensive model that can be used with a wide range of applications involving user contexts. The structure is designed to enable effective matching and retrieval of contexts. The user context structure consists of five sub-contexts:

* Environment context
* Personal context
* Task context
* Social context
* Spatio-temporal context

Each sub-context should be considered as a container where an application developer can insert the important context attributes with values and types needed in the particular context-aware application, see the UML class diagram below that shows the various parts of the user context model:

<div class=“uml”>(

User "1" — "*" UserContext : is related to
UserContext o— SocialContext
UserContext o— TaskContext
UserContext o— PersonalContext
UserContext o— EnvironmentContext
UserContext o— SpatioTemporalContext

class PersonalContext {
+ MentalContext
+ PhysiologicalContext
}

</div>

h3. Environment context

This part of the user context captures the entities that surround the user. These entities may be (but are not limited to) things, services, temperature, light, humidity, noise, and persons. Information (e.g. text, images, movies, sounds) that is accessed by the user can be linked to the environment context. The various networks that are in the surrounding area can also be described in the userâ€™s environment context.

h3. Personal context

This part of the user context consists of two sub contexts: the physiological context and the mental context. The physiological context contains information such as pulse, blood pressure, weight, glucose level, retinal pattern, and hair colour. The mental context contains information like mood, interests, expertise, angriness, stress, etc.

h3. Task context

This context describes what people are doing. The task context can be described with explicit goals, tasks, actions, activities, or events. Note that this can also include other personsâ€™ tasks that are within the situation. For example, considering a car with a driver and passengers, the situation can include the driver driving the car, passengers doing various activities such as reading, watching the car TV, and listening to music on the personal stereo. The task context of the driver and the passengers will be different.

h3. Social context

This context describes the social aspects of the current user context. It can contain information about friends, neighbours, co-workers, relatives, and their presence. One important aspect in a social context is the role that the user plays in the context. A role can for instance be described with a name, the userâ€™s status in this role, and connections to the tasks in the task context. A role can, in addition, be played in a social arena. A social arena can have a name like â€œat workâ€.

h3. Spatio-temporal context

This context aspect describes aspects of the user context relating to the time and spatial location for the user context. It may contain attributes for time, location, direction, speed, shape (of objects/buildings/terrain), track, place, clothes of the user and so on (i.e. the physical extension of the environment and the things in it) .

h3. Validation of the user context model

Below, we relate othersâ€™ work on context models within the model above.

Environment context captures the entities around the user. It includes objects of the surrounding environment (e.g. buildings, outdoor facilities, infrastructure) and their state (i.e. temperature, light, humidity, noise). It also describes information â€“ what Lucas (2001) calls information context â€“ as part of the environment. Furthermore, devices that reside in the usersâ€™ vicinity are also accounted for as part of the environment. Attributes of these devices define the extent with which personalisation can be performed (Chalmers and Sloman, 1999). Examples include the processing power, screen size/resolution, colour support, sound capabilities and the kind and number of input devices. Similar to Goker and Myrhaug, (2002), Schmidt, Biegl, and Gellersen (1999) also categorises contextual information about device(s) as part of the physical environment.

Personal context is equal to the user information that is stored in a typical user model (as also discussed later in following section). It can be distinguished into userâ€™s physiological context (e.g. age or body weight) and userâ€™s mental context (e.g. interest). This is similarly described in Schmidt, Biegl, and Gellersen (1999), that states that â€information on the user comprises for instance knowledge of habits, mental state or physiological characteristicsâ€. Attributes that are represented by the mental context can generally be found in user models. Examples include userâ€™s identity, preferences, knowledge and skills as listed in Reichenbacherâ€™s context model (2007). Userâ€™s interest is one of the most important attributes that is commonly modelled in most user models and has been widely applied in personalised information systems (Brusilovsky, 1996).

Task context contains information about what the user is doing or aiming for. It describes â€the functional relationship of the user with other people and objectsâ€ (Bradley and Dunlop, 2004), including the benefits and constraints of this relationship. It can be modelled as explicit goals, actions and activities. Userâ€™s activity is a common type of context in a number of context models such as the one described in Reichenbacher (2007) as well as Chalmers and Sloman (1999).

Social context represents the social environment of a user. It may describe usersâ€™ relationships to like-minded people that are connected to the user. Social filtering systems implement one special kind of social context modelling (Griffith and Oâ€™Riordan, 2000). The recommendation output is solely based on a user being similar to other users who rated items previously. This social connection is then exploited to recommend more items. Social filtering systems have demonstrated good results for a range of relevant topics such as music (Shardanand and Maes, 1995) and news (Resnick et al., 1994). Social context may model a userâ€™s list of friends or colleagues â€“ perhaps explicitly expressed by that user or implicitly acquired through an email address book or buddy list on a website.

Spatio-temporal context represents physical space and time. The spatial aspect represents physical space. Location is the most common aspect of a spatial context. Mobile guides such as Cyberguide (Abowd et al., 1997), GUIDE (Cheverst et al., 2000) and the CRUMPET system (Zipf, 2002) belong to a special class of applications that are commonly referred to as location-based services. Based on its relevance, location modelling has emerged as one research branch in location-based services; a comprehensive overview is provided in Jiang and Yao (2006). Many location-based services employ location for the personalisation of geographic maps. Location can be represented either geographically or semantically as described in Beigl (2002). The geographic representation exhibits locations by its position (i.e. coordinates provided from the Global Positioning System (GPS)). On the other hand, the semantic representation describes locations in a more descriptive and humanly understandable way, yet still able to be processed by a computer. The comMotion system described in Marmasse and Schmandt (2000) for example learned meaningful locations semantically by analysing usersâ€™ GPS logs over time. Besides location, spatial context also models attributes such as the direction of movement, the viewing direction and the speed of movement.

The temporal aspect, of the spatio-temporal sub-context, refers to time and can be represented as an absolute measurement or in a more relative manner (e.g. â€™in the eveningâ€™ or â€™before a meetingâ€™). In Hull et al. (1997), time is part of the usersâ€™ environment. Similarly, Reichenbacher (2007) views it together with location as part of a situation. In Schmidt, Biegl, and Gellersen (1999), temporal context is related to all other context attributes representing the contextual change of those attributes over time. In Bradley and Dunlop (2004), temporal context is described as being â€embedded within everything, and is what gives a current situation meaning…â€.

Overall, although there is some empirical work (Bierig and Goker, 2006) that investigates more closely a context model and its attributes, there is generally a lack of empirical work for investigating the relation between various context attributes.

h2. Device context model in webinos

The following device context model describes aspects of a situation seen from the device’s point of view. This is proposed as a framework for using device contexts within and across webinos applications. As with the user context, we also believe this this to be a fairly comprehensive model that can be used with a wide range of applications involving device contexts. It is anticipated that most, if not all, device context information can be sub-categorised and stored within this generic structure. The device context structure consists of five sub-contexts:

<div class=“uml”>(

DeviceContext o— SensorContext
DeviceContext o— DisplayContext
DeviceContext o— SoundContext
DeviceContext o— SystemContext
DeviceContext o— NetworkContext

</div>

h3. Sensor Context

A sensor context contains context attributes where the values of the context attributes originates from sensors connected to the device. It describes the sensor aspects of the device. It can contain information originating from any sensor on the device. Some examples of sensors may result in the storage of context data are: light, camera, motion, location, touch, temperature, biometric, microphone, keyboard, mouse, and near-field communication. One important aspect for the sensor context it therefore to be able to make sensors update contexts.


h3. Display Context

The display context describes aspects of the display(s) connected to the device. The context information may be (but are not limited to) describing the screen, the type, the identifier, the resolution, the color depth and format, if it is a 3D enabled display, its standby state, the application being displayed, its luominosity and so on. One could also store attributes data about a as well as the shape of the display shape, text and line drawing capabilities.

h3. Sound Context

A sound context is meant for capturing and storing context information about the sound context of the device. This can include information about the available loud speakers, the headset, the system volume, the supported sound qualities such as mono, stereo, surround, and environmental sound. It could be if the sound is muted, what the balance between the loud speakers is set to, the various accoustic levels in the surroundings, whether there is a microphone available or not, the type of microphone connected, the sound card that is installed and so on.

h3. System Context

This part of the device context captures the local system capabilities of the device. The context information categorised within this can be (but not limited to) processor, work load, identifier, name, model, operating system, webinos runtime. Power consumption, battery, battery status, hardware devices, multi-media codecs available, mime types supported, the supported HTML version, the supported CSS version, available applications, available displays, available braille devices, printers, USB disks, hard drives, flash drives, database drivers, filesystem, cloud system folders and so on.


h3. Network Context

A network context describes aspects of the various networks that the device either currently is conntected to- or the network bearer capabilities assumed available on the local device. For applications using network context, one could for instance foresee the likelihood of capturing various network topologies, the bandwidth of a network, measures of physical distance between network nodes, measures of latency between network nodes, degrees of trust for network nodes etc. Furthermode, the various attributes could be described for WLAN, Bluetooth, USB, GSM, Ethernet, Firewire, children. Nearby/ connected devices could be added to the network context, such as mobile phones, printers, displays, payment terminals, laptops, car infotainment system and so on. This, a network context is related to Quality of Service (QoS) aspects of the network and node connectivity.

Application context model in webinos
------------------------------------

The following application context model describes aspects of a situation seen from the application’s point of view. This is proposed as a framework for using application contexts within and across webinos applications. As with the device context, we also believe this to be a fairly comprehensive model that can be used with a wide range of applications involving application contexts. We believe that there is a potentially large amount of context information can be sub-categorised and kept within this structure. The application context consists of the following four sub-contexts:

<div class="uml">

ApplicationContext o— ProviderContext
ApplicationContext o— ResourceContext
ApplicationContext o— RuntimeContext

</div>
### ProviderContext

The provider category contains information that is related to the provision of applications data and content. It can be information about the provider of the application, such as the name, the authority, the access period, if the application is enabled, and so on. It can also contain information about what type of content/data that the application is capable of offering to other applications including the webinos platform. This could be sound, images, contacts, business cards etc. For instance, if two applications on the same device would like to provide contacts, because the user is creating contacts within each application, there is the issue of negotiating permission with the runtime to be able share this with other applications in a standardised way. Secondly, if an application would like to make some of its data public, one could alternatively specify new attributes and make them public.

### ResourceContext

This context describes aspects of the resources available for the application. It can contain information about the originating app store, raw data, layouts, menus, preferences, settings, storages, XML files, and so on. With resources we mean the resouces available for the application, whether it is downloadable or hosted.

### RuntimeContext

Context information relating to various runtime components could be included in this category. This could be context data about activities, widgets, activities, services, servers, etc. Furthermore, one could include information about the state of the runtime, the required runtime for an application to work, the required libraries, the minimum libraries that has to be present, the minim html version that is needed and so on.
