Discovery
=========

Scope:

The Webinos discovery involves two major steps: to find other PZPs and to find webinos services provided by the found PZPs. This section only focuses on the process of finding other PZPs. Security and privacy issues related to the PZP discovery are not covered.

1. Introduction
---------------

Webinos PZP discovery defines interfaces and procedures to allow automatic detection of PZPs in other devices, within or outside personal zone, via local or remote connections.

From webinos discovery API point of view, PZP is treated as a service of webinos. It is, however, different from other Webinos services. PZP provides the functionality of hosting and managing other webinos services.

This section outlines PZP discovery process in three steps

-   PZP registration and advertisement
-   Querying or finding other PZPs based on certain criteria
-   Binding with discovered PZPs

Facing the challenges of a wide variety of discovery protocols used these days due to multiplicity of networking technology and various working scenarios introduced by webinos personal zone concept, webinos PZP discovery aims at providing a generic PZP discovery interface for web developers in all circumstances.

Descriptions of each of these steps are associated with two discovery approaches based on the network availability:
* PZH assisted PZP discovery. This requires the availability of network connections between PZPs and their PZHs, and between PZHs if cross-zone PZP discovery happens.
* Direct PZP discovery. It refers a direct discovery conversation between PZPs. Various existing discovery mechanisms can be used for this purpose, either via remote or local network connections.

When existing discovery mechanisms are adopted for PZP discovery, a protocol mapper/wrapper is required to isolate the complexity of different internetworking technologies and present discovery interface as generic as possible to the web developers. The relationship among these three parties is show in the following diagram.

In each step, protocols and interfaces are defined.

2. Technical Use Cases
----------------------

3. Technical Formal Specification
---------------------------------

**Preconditions:**
* Each PZP has enrolled in a persona zone. Enrolment is defined by when a PZP receives a certificate signed by the PZH for all future TLS connections.
* Zones have authenticated each other in inter-zone PZP discovery scenario. To ensure a secure and successful inter-zone discovery, e.g. a PZP in PZH_A to discovery PZPs in PZH_B, the zones involved in the discovery have to authenticate with each other beforehand. It means that both parties have registered each other’s certificate as being trusted after a certificate exchange procedure.

### 3.1. PZP registration and advertisement

One of the key areas in PZP discovery is to make the PZP discoverable or visible to potential PZPs that performing PZP searches. This requires registering and advertising the PZP at a point, e.g. a database in a central server or service list file in a local device, that others can locate or look up.

### 3.1.1 PZP registers with PZH

In webinos, for the first time PZP connects its PZH, it shall registers its service information to the PZH. The following information are mandatory:

-   PZP identity
-   PZP name
-   PZP connection state

These information are updated at the following cases:
* On receiving change notification from PZP
* On PZP re-connecting to PZH

PZH has provided a central place to maintain the information that all its PZPs provide. The following diagram shows the message flows when PZPs registers with their PZH.

<div class="uml">

PZP_A -> PZH : setupTLSConnection(PZP_A_ID, PZP_A_Name, …)
 PZP_A -> PZP_A : openListenerChannel
 PZH -> PZH : addPZPInfo(ConnectedPZPList, PZP_A)

PZP_B -> PZH : setupTLSConnection(PZP_B_ID, PZP_B_Name, …)
 PZP_B -> PZP_B : openListenerChannel
 PZH -> PZH : addPZPInfo(ConnectedPZPList, PZP_B)

</div>
### 3.1.2 Register PZP in existing discovery schemes

In the case that PZH is not reachable or direct PZP discovery is preferred, PZP relies on available existing discovery schemes for the purpose. To be able to use existing discovery schemes for PZP discovery, the PZP service must make itself registered and available in the service list or service database of the discovery scheme. In this case, new service registration procedure in under layer discovery scheme is triggered by a call on the generic PZP registration interfac.

### 3.1.3 Interface mappings

Since PZP is considered as a service in webinos. It shall follow URI format of service type defined in 3.4. This format is not adopted by all existing discovery schemes. While registering or creating PZP service in these schemes, a type mapping scheme shall be provided in PZP discovery design. The following diagram give an example on how this works.

-   **ServiceType**
    PZP is considered as a service in webinos. It shall follow URI format of service type defined in 3.4. In order to isolate the complexity of lower level discovery schemes and expose a generic service type to web developer, a type mapping scheme shall be provided in PZP discovery design. The following diagram illustrate the relationships among these entities.

![](http://dev.webinos.org/redmine/attachments/2239/service_type_mapping.png)

-   **??Options**

The timeout value shall be overrode by messaging timeout value if specified.

-   **Filter**

The use of DiscoveryMethod is in conjunction with remoteServices. Whilst remoteServices is disabled, local discovery methods, e.g. zeroconf, bluetooth SDP etc, apply. If remoteServices is enabled, remote discovery mechanisms, e.g. XMPP discovery, apply.

In the case of zoneId is not specified, PZP discovery shall only look for other PZPs in the same zone.

In the case of remoteServices is not specified, PZP discovery shall limit the search for services that are connected directly to the device or to the same local IP network.

In the case of DiscoveryMethod is not specified, a default DiscoveryMethod set by the system shall be used.

### Bind services

Basically, the Webinos service discovery module enables web developers to find service (it includes devices) based on a certain search criteria. The found services are listed in a selection list in an asynchronous manner. Once the user selected a service, the implementation of the service is initiated by binding to the service. For further details on these APIs and example codes, please refer WP3.2 Discovery APIs.

bind(BindCallBack bindCallBack, optional DOMString serviceId);

### JavaScript APIs

Webinos provides a JavaScript Discovery API for web developers. The Discovery API is defined in Webinos Discovery specification. The Discovery Interface provides two methods that are used to find services:

* findServices(), to query for services
 * getServiceId(), to get a unique identity of service that can be shared between two peers.

[1] servicetype: definition of servicetype shall follow InterfaceServiceType defined in 3.4.
[2] Filter:

interface Filter {

attribute DOMString[] zoneId;

attribute boolean remoteServices;

* attribute DOMString[] DiscoveryMethod;*

attribute ServiceLocation? serviceLocation;
 };

The search query is asynchronous and there will be a success callback for every service that is found. The time for finding services can vary significantly depending of which type of discovery method that is used, e.g. Bluetooth service discovery. An application must thereby be able to handle cases where the search query continues for a reasonable amount of time. The default max search query time is defined to 120 seconds.

The second part of the service discovery process is to Bind to the requested services. This method is implemented by the Service Interface as defined in Service Interface.

The Bind operation will mutually authenticate the application/service, verify access/privacy policies and instantiate an implementation of the API in asynchronous manner. Once the service binding has been successfully executed, the API will be ready to use by the application and the service object will act as a proxy to the remote peer. A more detailed example of how to use the API is available here discovery code example
