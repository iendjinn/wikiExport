Authentication and User Identity Management
-------------------------------------------

### Introduction

Webinos aims to be an easy-to-use web application framework. Users will be able to enjoy services across their devices and application developers will be able to easily implement distributed applications. webinos supports developers largely by the features that are in place which are transparent to the application and its developer. One of these core features is authentication and establishment of a secure communication channel. Whenever an application needs to communicate with a service on another device, the webinos runtime establishes the authenticated and secure communication channel. The application developer only needs to access the remote API. The user simply authenticates to one of their device. After authentication the user can access any of the services on any of the devices in the personal zone. Details of this architecture are described in deliverable [[Deliverable_References#Webinos-D31|D3.1]]. The corresponding authentication API is described in deliverable [[Deliverable_References#Webinos-D32|D3.2]]

This section focuses on the reasons for authentication architecture decisions, security considerations and further work yet to be done in phase II.

### Background

Authentication on the web is pretty much left to the web application developer. It is one of the features which are to be built in applications. This requires application developers to deal with identification, authentication, session management and access control. However, poorly implemented authentication mechanisms and session management are often reasons for attacks which even draw the attention of mass media as often large amount of personal user data was stolen. On the [[Deliverable_References#OWASP-Top10|OWASP Top 10]] of vulnerabilities of web application, broken authentication and session management are the top 3. Authentication on the web needs to be improved in many ways:

-   implementation for the developer needs to be simplified,
-   the developer still has to keep control of authentication if desired to tightly adjust authentication to the application’s needs,
-   users should no longer be bothered with memorising passwords,
-   users should be informed at any time about their current authentication state, and
-   single sign-on (SSO) should be provided for users

Designing such an authentication architecture while retaining the flexibility needed by vast kinds of applications is challenging. Webinos approaches this challenge in two steps: first, a webinos-internal authentication mechanism is designed, second, a authentication mechanism for services on the open Internet will be designed. At the current stage of the webinos project, the former has been specified and described in deliverable [[Deliverable_References#Webinos-D31|D3.1]]. The latter will be defined in phase II of the project. However, a high-level architecture is already discussed in [[Deliverable_References#Webinos-D31|D3.1]], too.

In webinos, any device can not only act as a client by running a web application. It can also provide a service at the same time. Services shall be shared among various devices within webinos. Some of these devices belong to the same user, others belong to other users. For ease of use, the overlay network and the discovery service have been introduced in webinos. They allow the user to easily access services without the need to know by which devices they are provided and to which network the devices are connected at the time of usage. Conceptually, the personal zone has been introduced to define the boundary within which all devices of the same user can communicate freely using webinos.

The webinos-internal authentication mechanism has been designed to suit the concept of the personal zone and to be easy to use for users and for application developers. We deliberately decided to not involve a central third party in the webinos-internal authentication who can issue and validate certificates. Having a large public key infrastructure (PKI) within webinos has three major drawbacks:

1.  it won’t scale as any other global PKI does not scale,
2.  it is difficult to determine who should act as certification authority for individual users in an open source setting as the one of webinos, and
3.  certificate revocation cannot be determined when devices have no connection to the open Internet.

As a consequence, it has been decided that each Personal Zone Hub (PZH) in webinos also acts as the certification authority (CA) for the personal zone. All devices within the zone possess their own certificate, issued by the PZH, and they possess the self-signed CA-certificate of the PZH. Thus each device can validate zone membership of another device.

When devices of two different personal zones ought to communicate, the two PZHs of the two involved personal zones need to exchange their self-signed certificates. Once a PZH caches the certificate of another PZH, the personal zone of the other PZH is considered trusted. [[Deliverable_References#Webinos-D31|D3.1]] describes in detail how such a trust relationship is established.

In fact, each personal zone has its own small PKI. Due to the small number of devices in a zone and due to the small number of trust relationships, this kind of certification scales in terms of number of issued certificates within webinos. However, this webinos-internal authentication will not work as soon as users are to be authenticated to services on the open Internet. These services may not be webinos-enabled and they may not implement the concept of the personal zones. Therefore in phase II of the webinos project, the authentication mechanism for the open Internet will be specified. Its purpose is to authenticate the user to the PZH and to provide means within the PZH to perform SSO with the service on the open Internet. It is planned to utilise standardised technologies (e.g. OpenID and OAuth) to achieve that. It is likely that these technologies are to be extended in order to achieve secure and easy-to-use authentication on the Internet.

We have decided that in webinos the personal zone represents the user. Any device or application which is doing something (e.g. communicating with another device) does this by identifying its personal zone to which it belongs. Since the user is related to the personal zone, there is a relation between the user and the applications. The applications and devices actually act on behalf of the user and represent the user in the digital world by the certificates which are issued by the PZH. For intra-zone and inter-zone communication, this is the desired effect. All the users wish to know who is behind the device or application which communicates with them. This is the basis on which trust relationships are established in webinos when personal zone certificates are exchanged. It follows the idea that people are communicating and they want to share their devices and applications remotely to improve quality of their communication.

With that in mind, the idea of using social relations/social proximity as one factor of identification of users is straightforward. The only crucial point in this architecture is that users indeed verify that a device which claims to be the one of a particular user actually belongs to this user. This is done during exchange of the self-signed certificate of the PZHs.

For authentication on the open Internet, this is different. There, the certificate of the PZH cannot be validated. There is the need of involving established identity providers. Users will be allowed to combine their existing identifiers with the SSO feature of webinos. No user will have to create new identifiers when introducing webinos. Furthermore, the user may not want to reveal the identity. This is why we will also investigate the use of pseudonyms and partial identities for authentication.

### Threats to Security

The strength of the identification and authentication architecture of webinos is that it is usable and secure at the same time. However, as every new architecture, it brings some weak parts which have to be considered particularly when further detailing the deign and when implementing it. This subsection enumerates and discusses them, while the next subsection describes how we plan to address them in the next design improvement iteration in phase II.

It may be argued that the manual establishment of trust relations between personal zones by exchanging certificates of the PZH may be weak. There is no technical or automated means to validate a certificate. It is up to the user to accept a certificate as valid. Many users may just click _yes_ when they are asked if they wish to trust this certificate. In the contrary, we believe that the list of pre-installed certificates in the web browser is as good or bad as the manual validation. An attacker could easily add own certificates and provide the manipulated browser for download and some of the simple certification authorities whose certificates are included in the browser by default do not have a strong validation of identities when issuing a certificate. Our concept leaves the decision to the user, making the user a
responsible entity in the system. Like in real life, it is up to the user to determine who they trust. For that to work, they are not required to understand the complex matter of certificates and PKI. They always can use any preferred channel to verify with their communication partners, who are real persons, such as family members or friends, if both see the same certificate. That’s all.

The PZH and the PZP are sensitive components of the webinos architecture. If an attacker manages to add additional certificates in the trusted users cache on a PZP or to break into the PZH and issue new certificates with its CA functionality, the attacker can make the user to access one of the attacker’s service by believing it is the user’s service and the attacker can impersonate as the user by possessing a device which is assumed to belong to the user. To avoid this, a couple of requirements MUST be fulfilled:

-   The code base of the PZP and the PZH needs to be as small as possible. Both shall only provide necessary features. The smaller the code base is the easier it can be verified for correct implementation.
-   Specification of the architecture details, the protocols and the implementation are to be performed with greatest possible care. See the [[Deliverable_Guidelines|Security and Privacy Guidelines]] section.
-   Sensitive data, such as the certificates of PZHs and private keys need to be stored in a tamper-resistant module. Preferably, this module is a separate hardware component in the device.
-   Each webinos-enabled device must fulfil the requirements stated in the _Specification â€“ Authentication and Identity_ section of deliverable [[Deliverable_References#Webinos-D31|D3.1]].

In webinos, users are authenticated by the devices. Since there is a broad variety of devices, there is no pre-defined authentication mechanisms. However, devices shall implement user authentication in a way that it is strong and reliable and difficult to forge. All in all, the strength of user authentication in a personal zone is defined by the device with the weakest authentication mechanism.

### Future Directions

As previously mentioned, in phase II, webinos will have to improve the design of some of the components from security perspective. These are enumerated in this subsection. Each paragraph is devoted to one issue.

The authentication on the open Internet will be further detailed. From the high level design which exists right now, it will be brought to detail by trying to utilise existing technologies which are established on the web as much as possible. But we also expect to contribute a new form of user authentication for the Internet to close the gaps we identified in this section.

The process of installing the PZP on a device is to be specified in more detail. No room for attackers shall be left which would allow them to forge a component during PZP installation in order to avoid that the attacker can take control of the PZP. A further issue to be decided is which identifiers of a device (e.g. MAC address, Bluetooth address) should be mentioned in the certificate of the device in order to tightly bind the certificate to the device. Tamper-proof binding of the device to the certificate and privacy concerns need to be balanced.

When a device is lost or stolen, the user has to have the chance to revoke certificates issued by the PZH and to remotely erase the certificates and keys on the lost/stolen device. Mechanisms and APIs will be provided to implement these features. Certificate revocation also includes notification of all the PZHs which have received the revoked certificate in the past. Expiry and short-lived certificates may support this.

Real time communication on mobile devices may require to skip integrity verification on the secure channel which is set-up by the use of TLS whenever devices communicate in webinos. Like in the mobile industry (2G, 3G radio network), for quality of service, there is no integrity protection on the radio link for voice connections. From security perspective this is discouraged, as it opens new attack vectors. However, if it turns out in practice that this is required for reliability and quality of the real time streams, it has to be considered.

It is yet to be defined how a user registers with webinos. When a user establishes oneâ€™s personal zone, the PZH has to be installed, the CA has to be launched and the user shall be the only entity to have access to most of the PZH features. How all this is bootstrapped will be defined. Further to that, in case a user loses his device and he only had that one in the zone, how a new device is added to the already fully configured zone will be defined.

User authentication is currently only discussed for devices which the user actively uses (e.g. a mobile phone). However, there are others which permanently run services without users being authenticated/logged-in. In the latter case, the PZP needs access to the private key even without user authentication just from the point in time where the device was added to the zone. It will be a task of phase II to elaborate upon this feature.
