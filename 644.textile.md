[[User ID and Data Management|Back to User Identity and User Data Management]]

20110418 conf call on User Identity Management
==============================================

Date: 18 Apr 2011
Time: 16:00 - 17:00 CEDT
Bridge: PowWowNow, _Enhanced Access_, PIN: 312806, "Dial-in numbers":http://pdf.powwownow.com/pdf/GBR_en_pwn-dial-in-numbers.pdf

Agenda:
* Status update on discussions with other sub-topic groups
* Discussion of further details of the architecture, based on:
**** questions by the Policy Management sub-topic group
*** How applications request identity information: will applications state in a manifest that they need logins? Will they request a certain _type_ of identity? Or will this be in javascript? Presumably some applications will only trust some identity providers, how will this be expressed?
*** In either scenario, will applications require information about how authentication was carried out?
*** Identity negotiation: how might a user decided to give away less information or use a pseudonym?
** [[User_ID_and_Data_Management_Discussion#Combination-of-User-ID-Management-User-Data-Management-and-Discovery-the-Big-Pcture|activity diagrams]],
**** the discussions of the [[20110408_conf_call_on_User_Identity_Management|second to last]] and the [[20110414_conf_call_on_User_Identity_Management|last conf call]], and
**** the [[User_ID_and_Data_Management_Discussion#Open-Issues-as-of-14-April-2011|open issues]]
* Start decision making on open issues and architecture details
* Planning of next steps, incl. planning of WP3 meeting in May

Action Items:
* All: contribute to the [[User_ID_and_Data_Management_Discussion|Discussion]] wiki page in order to prepare for the face-to-face meeting in Berlin in May. This includes:
**** familiarise with the issues their and have an idea for the problems and possible solutions
**** contribute issues (problems, solutions, …) to the page

Attendees:
* Sven
* Christian Schaefer
* John
* Habib
* Andrea
* Katrin
* Ziran
* Matthias

Discussion:
* Interfacing with other sub-topic groups:
**** Discovery
*** Sven reports on new forum entry with questions for discovery which were already answered by Habib
** **Please contribute!**
*** Also contributed to [[Device_Discovery_High_Level_Architecture|Discovery High Level Architecture]] wiki page some commnets for discussion
** Overlay: no progress
**** Polcy management: see discussion of the questions below

-   John’s questions on policy architecture
    -   from developers perspective
    -   Sven explains his view
        -   APIs are mainly JavaScript based as webinos apps (being Web clients in a browser) access other apps/services using JavaScript; developers are exposed to authentication API which is OAuth-based (similar to Facebook). Just a login() Function is there. Apps do not need to bother with details of identification and auth. Webinos will identify and authenticate in the background, using SSO where possible. The app is just returned success confirmation
        -   Need for authentication is communicated by the service once the client accesses
            -   HTTP login request or JavaScript function? Nick seems to prefer JavaScript function
        -   webinos runtime has to provide UI for choosing Identity to be used for authentication
            -   UI are not covered by any sub-topic group at the moment, we needs to cover this UI issue y ourselves
            -   can be as simple as possible but is needed
        -   security critical apps may want to know more about how auth went and might want to re-auth each time
            -   might want to influence lifetime of tickets

-   Activity diagrams proposed by Sven
    -   John agrees to the need of registrar, as well as Habib and the Discovery wiki page did before
    -   Katrin: registrar should not be a single entity, should be online, but needs offline cache
    -   John: who hosts the registrar
        -   anybody who wants to (openness of webinos), mobile network operators and social network operators are particularly suitable as they know the user and as they can authenticate the user (required for bootstrapping registration of users)
    -   Ziran: Do we require a webinos IDP? Are there also others? How does IDP cope with several identities?
        -   Sven: Any user can have any number of Identities with any number of IDPs. Webinos will provide an IDP, but others (e.g. Facebook) can be used as well, also for SSO. If users and devices are identified by URI (which appears to be the currently favoured identifier), identifier can look like an email address where the first part is the user ID and the second part the FQDN of the IDP/Registrar.
    -   **We all have to write down assumptions and open questions for the f2f meeting**
        -   **please contribute to all content to the page!**
    -   one presentation which reports to the others outside our discussion with assumptions and concerns
        -   Should be derived from the page.

Next meeting: conf call on Tue 26 Apr, 10:00 - 11:00 CEDT
