Attack Patterns Not Included in the Architectural Risk Analysis
===============================================================

Due to time constraints, the following attacks are documented but have not been included in the full risk analysis. They are lacking obstacle models and connection to system goals and architectural models. We intend to add them to the CAIRIS system in the final year of the project.

Misidentification of a PZH through disconnected TLS and HTTPS certificates.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

#### Description

During enrolment of a PZP to a PZH, the user visits their PZH web interface to collect a short authentication token. This web interface is authenticated using standard web PKI and DNS. The enrolment process then allows the PZP to connect to the same provider and present the token. However, the PZP authentication process currently uses a different certificate (the PZH certificate not the PZH provider web interface). This is an opportunity for a man-in-the-middle attack. The same flaw may be present when a PZH is first instantiated.

  Attacker                Ethan
  Intent                  Automatically enrolling people to the wrong personal zone provider in order to capture and sell user data and credentials
  Target asset            Personal data
  Exploit asset           PZP
  Target threat           CAPEC-272: Protocol Manipulation

  ----------------------- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- -- -------- -------

#### Consequences

This attack is based on a protocol flaw, and would be a vulnerability in all deployments. As a result, any webinos user could be susceptible and there could be widespread loss of data and credentials, affecting the security of personal information and privacy loss.

### Implementation

TODO: Upload diagram

Ethan sets up a PZH. Users are then invited through means such as phishing to enrol into the PZH. The PZH presents itself to the users as a genuine PZH with the intention that it be misidentified.

### Obstacles

|_.Obstacle |_.Category |_.Definition |
|Loss of credentials or data | Vulnerability | The credentials and data used by or stored on a PZP are stolen or accessed by unwanted parties |
 |PZP Enrolled in Wrong PZH | Vulnerability | A PZP is enrolled into a PZH which the user did not intend |
 |PZP presents credentials to PZH | Vulnerability | A PZP upon joining a PZH presents its credentials or credentials are synchronised as part of data synchronisation |
 |PZP synchronises its data with PZH | Vulnerability | A PZP upon joining a PZH presents its credentials or credentials are synchronised as part of data synchronisation |
 |PZH Uses a Different TLS Certificate | Vulnerability | A PZH uses a different TLS certificate from that used by the web server |
 |PZH Design allows disconnected TLS and web server certificates | Goal Support | A PZH is designed to allow the web server and TLS server to operate independently so that they can use different credentials |
 |Wrong Web Server Certificate | Vulnerability | The web server uses a wrong certificate or user ignores or fails to validate the certificate |
 |Correct URl But Wrong Underlying TLS Credentials | Vulnerability | A PZH is accessed through the correct URL but its implementation uses different TLS credentials |
 |Incorrect PZH URL with False Credentials | Vulnerability | The PZH URL accessed is the wrong one but the PZH presents false credentials that make it seem as though the user is accessing the correct PZH |
 |PZH Credentials Compromised | Vulnerability | Credentials stored or used by the PZH are compromised|
 |User Visits Wrong PZH URL | Vulnerability | A user visits the wrong PZH URL perhaps through redirection |
 |User Does Not Check PZH URL | Vulnerability | A user visits the wrong PZH URL without checking the actual address through redirection |
 |PZH Presents False Credentials | Vulnerability | A PZH presents credentials that seem to be correct to the user but are not genuine|
 |Automatically Redirected to URL | Vulnerability | A user is automatically redirected to some URL which she did not intend to visit |
 |PZH URL too complicated | Vulnerability | The PZH admin URL is complicated and easy to misread|
 |PZH URL displayed without prominence | Vulnerability | The PZH admin URL bar is not visible or easy to miss |
 |Insufficiently Protected PZH Credentials | Vulnerability | Credentials stored on the PZH are not adequately protected |

#### Mitigations

Make sure that the initial enrolment process identifies the PZH’s TLS certificates. Or, modify the underlying TLS certificate to use the PZH provider’s certificate rather than a different certificate.

Malicious service misuse
------------------------

#### Description

Applications use the findService() call to find services of a particular type. It is expected that applications will then present these services to the user for them to select.

However, an application doesn’t need to obey the user’s intentions and might invoke a different service to the one selected. Indeed, this might be because the user is intentionally _not_ selecting a service for security reasons. E.g., the user may select a storage service with only media files, but the application may then access files elsewhere.

The policy system can only handle this if policies refer to services at a finer granularity rather than API types + devices.

One motivation for this attack could be corporate espionage: an application used for a business purpose could attempt to find out extra information from the end user.

#### Details

  ----------------------- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- -- -------- -------
  Attacker                Jessica
  Intent                  Obtain private and confidential user information from APIs based on user anti-preferences
  Target asset            Personal data
  Exploit asset           Discovery API and Policy manager
  Target threat           
  Exploit vulnerability   
  Known uses              None
  Related patterns        None
  ----------------------- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- -- -------- -------

#### Consequences

Users unintentionally share information they had explicitly not wanted to share or give an application access to.

#### Mitigations

Restrict applications on the _service_ rather than API level. Provide visual clues as to which services an application may access.

The webinos botnet.
-------------------

#### Description

Webinos is used to create a botnet. A botnet is often used to gain personal data (credit card information, for example) en masse, or perform DDoS attacks on target websites and web services. There are many possible ways this could be done:

-   An implementation flaw is exploited in the widget renderer, which abuses its trusted relationship with the PZP to make arbitrary API requests and access remote services.
-   A method of enrolling rogue devices into personal zones is discovered which allows an attacker to join every personal zone. They can then install applications in every personal zone.
-   A PZP implementation flaw (perhaps a native API implementation) is exploited by an application in order to install native malware on the device. Because this API is commonly available, the malware spreads rapidly.
-   Native device malware (outside of webinos) steals PZP keys and credentials and is able to hijack the personal zone.

#### Details

These details concentrate on the possibility of an implementation flaw.

  ----------------------- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- -- -------- -------

  Target threat           CAPEC-8: Buffer Overflow in an API Call
  Exploit vulnerability   CWE-75: Failure to Sanitize Special Elements into a Different Plane (Special Element Injection)
  Known uses              None
  Related patterns        None
  ----------------------- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- -- -------- -------

#### Consequences

Loss of personal or payment data, loss of availability for a website or service. Users being marked as ‘malicious’ by network providers identifying the rogue traffic.

  Target    Personal data
  Exploit   Rendering Engine
  --------- ------------------

### Implementation
TODO: Upload diagram

Ethan creates a webinos botnet and enrols several personal zones using the following options: i) An implementation flaw is exploited in the widget renderer, which abuses its trusted relationship with the PZP to make arbitrary API requests and access remote services; ii) A method of enrolling rogue devices into personal zones is discovered which allows an attacker to join every personal zone. They can then install applications in every personal zone; iii) A PZP implementation flaw (perhaps a native API implementation) is exploited by an application in order to install native malware on the device. Because this API is commonly available, the malware spreads rapidly; iv) Native device malware (outside of webinos) steals PZP keys and credentials and is able to hijack the personal zone.

### Obstacles

 | Disable valid personal zone proxy | Accountability_Threat | A valid device personal zone proxy is disabled |
 | Run multiple personal zone proxies | Accountability_Threat | Valid and malicious personal zone proxies run on a single device. |

#### Mitigations

-   Careful design and implementation of APIs and protocols.
-   Sanitise all user or application-provided input
-   Isolate rendering components from privileged components.
-   Defence-in-depth: recommend that users have anti-malware tools and do not install arbitrary applications.
-   Review device enrolment implementation
-   Use hardware-based key storage, such as a Trusted Platform Module

TLS certificate management errors
---------------------------------

#### Description

The webinos platform might contain a buggy TLS certificate handling implementation, resulting in authentication errors. E.g., accepting all certificates or all hostnames, or not verifying the full certificate path. This could allow a remote attacker to make them connect to invalid PZH providers.

Review TLS implementations, enforce correct certificate handling.

Remote JavaScript includes
--------------------------

#### Description

Taken from "You Are What You Include: Large-scale Evaluation of Remote JavaScript Inclusions":http://seclab.cs.ucsb.edu/media/uploads/papers/jsinclusions.pdf

Remotely including javascript in web applications is dangerous as it is a trust assumption many developers don’t consider. Attacking one common inclusion provider could attack multiple applications.

In this attack, we consider that Ethan might exploit a web server hosting a popular JavaScript library imported by many trusted applications.

Another option would be for an insider working on a popular JavaScript library to insert an application-specific attack. this might be fulfilled by Irwin.

#### Details

  ----------------------- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ -- -------- -------
  Attacker                Ethan
  Intent                  To gain access to multiple user devices to create a botnet or access personal data residing on a personal zone
  Target asset            Personal data, personal zone
  Exploit asset           Application
  Target threat           CAPEC-444: Malicious Logic Insertion into Product Software via Externally Manipulated Component, CAPEC-96: Block Access to Libraries (related)
  Exploit vulnerability   CWE-114: Process Control
  Known uses              None
  Related patterns        None
  ----------------------- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ -- -------- -------

#### Consequences

All applications using and importing this library are compromised: their access to APIs may be misused by the library editor to gain access to personal data and resources. Users may suffer from data loss, identity theft (applications could be overwritten to steal user data) and more.

#### Mitigations

Disabling remote script invocation from external origins. Further, a developer could specify that scripts may only be loaded if their integrity matches an included checksum.

Misidentification of users requesting inter-zone certificate exchange
---------------------------------------------------------------------

#### Description

Frankie pretends to be ‘Bob’ (one of Clara’s friends) when requesting access to Clara’s personal zone. He does this at the certificate exchange stage exploiting a potential lack of authentication of user identities. Frankie does this because he is obsessed with Clara and wants to find out more about her interests and track her activities to arrange ‘accidental meetings’.

#### Details

  ----------------------- ------------------------------------------------------------- -- -------- ----------
  Attacker                Frankie
  Intent                  Access personal data, track activities
  Target asset            Personal data
  Exploit asset           Certificate manager, PZH admin
  Target threat           CAPEC-196: Session Credential Falsification through Forging
  Exploit vulnerability   CWE-287: Improper Authentication
  Known uses              None
  Related patterns        None
  ----------------------- ------------------------------------------------------------- -- -------- ----------

#### Consequences

Users may unwittingly add someone to their list of ‘known users’ based on an invalid identification process and authentication. This could result in data disclosure to unwanted entities which could cause embarrassment, privacy loss, device damage, and more. This process could form the basis of a large-scale attack on all webinos users, adding invalid users to their personal zones.

#### Mitigations

The webinos zone certificate exchange process requires users requesting access to authenticate through their OpenID credentials which will tell the PZH their email address. There are several attacks on this process, but it should be possible to specify only OpenID providers who are trusted, and make sure that the email address domain matches the OpenID provider domain name. We also rely on users knowing each other’s OpenID email address or account URI. Alternative implementations might share user identity via social networks (e.g. a Facebook plugin).

Intra-zone privacy: not sharing applications across the whole zone
------------------------------------------------------------------

#### Description

Justin has a PC and a smartphone. He shares his PC with his girlfriend, sometimes, and so is careful to make sure that no embarrassing content is ever displayed. However, on his smartphone he installs more risquÃ© applications and has a less savoury browsing history.

Unfortunately, webinos synchronises his settings and application policies across all devices on his personal zone. When his girlfriend goes to change some settings on his webinos-enabled PC, she realises he has a "strip poker" application installed. A long argument ensues…

#### Details

  ----------------------- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- -- -------- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Attacker                None - misusability case. Arguably Justin’s girlfriend or the webinos platform itself.
  Intent                  None - Justin is attempting to maintain his privacy and his girlfriend may accidentally impose on that
  Target asset            Application data and Application identity
  Exploit asset           PZP
  Target threat           No clear mapping to CAPEC or OWASP
  Exploit vulnerability   Nothing perfect, but related - CWE-200: Information Exposure, CWE-612: Information Exposure Through Indexing of Private Data, CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere
  Known uses              None
  Related patterns        None
  ----------------------- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- -- -------- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

#### Consequences

User embarrassment and privacy loss.

#### Mitigations

Control synchronisation. Do not synchronise application manifests unless necessary. Allow users to purge local data and settings of private information. Restrict UI access to zone synchronisation data.

Unintentional privacy loss while sharing personal zone service addresses during inter-zone communication
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

#### Description

Two webinos users (Alice and Justin) connect their personal zones and request access to each others services. By requesting access, however, they share the address information of their applications and services. So Justin shares his device and application name and Alice shares her device and service identity.

In most cases this is not a problem, but it may result in embarrassment if it reveals the fact that Justin is in a location Alice wasn’t expecting - e.g., at home when he said he was away on holiday.

#### Details

  ----------------------- -----------------------------------
  Attacker                None: another user (e.g., Justin)
  Intent                  None
  Motive                  Loss of personal context
  Target asset            Personal data
  Exploit asset           inter-zone communication
  Target threat           None
  Exploit vulnerability   None
  Known uses              None
  Related patterns        None
  ----------------------- -----------------------------------

#### Consequences

Embarrassment.

#### Mitigations

Remove addressing information after it leaves the personal zone. However, this might not be reasonable if Alice (in this case) wants to know where Justin is accessing her data from.
