UI Adaptation - Introduction
============================

UI adaptation is a process of transforming the UI of an application according to the device capabilities, which can be:
* different screen resolutions, as depicted below

* different input methods: keyboard, mouse, tv remote, in-car controller knob
* different output methods: screen, voice
* different hardware resources (e.g. camera) that need their specific UI components

The transformation itself should be based upon a shared code and a set of rules, meaning it should conform to the "write once, run anywhere" principle. It would help not only the developers, but also the end-users to receive an app, that is best suited to the device on which it runs, providing an equally positive experience. And because you never know what future will bring, the solution has to be flexible and ready for extensions.

Since webinos is a cross-platform application delivery environment across a wide range of devices, UI adaptation is needed.
