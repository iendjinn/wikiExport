Informal low level event handling API attempt
=============================================

Please, always refer to "the current WP 3.1 draft deliverable spec":http://dev.webinos.org/redmine/projects/wp3-1/wiki/Spec_-_Messaging

h2. Data types

<pre><code class="javascript">
Event
{
 // string denoting "informal" event type (e.g., as in DOM events)- valid strings are would-be identifiers (regexp: [_a-zA-Z][_a-zA-Z0-9]**) except the special string "any"
 // this field does also determine the semantics of the payload field, if present
 type;

 // object representing the original sending entity (e.g., a Service object)
 // such object will contain an "hidden" address/globally-unique-ID and methods for communicating with it (to be provided by overlay networking/discovery)
 // for outgoing events it can be undefined, in which case the WRE will make sure it is interpreted as the "application address" at the other end
 source;

 // array of objects repsenting the original primary recipients of the event (as in source)
 to;

 // optional array of objects repsenting the original secondary recipients of the event (as in source)
 cc;

 // optional array of objects repsenting the original blind-carbon-copy recipients of the event (as in source)
 // if this is an ingoing event, it will either contain only one object representing the receiving entity if it was in bcc, will be undefined otherwise
 bcc;

 // string holding a hash of a certain serialization of the event object - to be used as a globally unique event ID
 // optional for not-yet-transmitted outgoing events, generated by WRE for ingoing events and transmitted events
 // for more information see the current draft deliverable spec
 id;

 // optional event object reference this event is a response to
 // for incoming events it will be undefined even if it was specified in case the WRE cannot find the original event object (e.g., it was garbage collected)
 inResponseTo;

 // optional Date object representing the moment in time in which the event is generated by the original event source
 timestamp;

 // optional Date object representing the moment in time past which the event is no more valid/meaningful
 expiryTimestamp;

 // optional boolean flag indicating that the event source wants to be notified by the event destination(s) about the result of the event delivery (default: false)
 notificationWanted;

 // optional boolean flag indicating whether the event should be stored and forwarded later if a destination is currently unavailable (default: false)
 cacheable;

 // optional boolean flag indicating whether the computation of the event ID should depend on the value of the Source field (default: false)
 sourceSensitive;

 // optional ordered array of EventForwarding objects representing the forwardings (may be partial) the event was subject to
 forwardings;

 // optional string containing arbitrary data (in alignment with the specified "type")
 payload;
}

EventForwarding
{
 // these fields are the same as in Event, except that only timestamp is optional
 source;
 to;
 cc;
 bcc;
 timestamp;
}

EventCallbacks
{
 // semantics to be defined (however I believe all should be optional)
 deliveredCB;
 sentCB;
 cachedCB;
 errorCB;
}
</code></pre>

h2. Functions

<pre><code class="javascript">
// Adds a listener callback to events of the specified type (Event.type) coming from the specified source (Event.source)
//
// Params:
//
// cb: callback function of type cb(event)
// source: entity object or null meaning "any source"
// destination: entity object representing some resource "controlled" by the application or null for the application itself
// (ISSUE: if there is an object representing the application itself, we could use null to match any destination, thus being consistent with source parameter)
// type: type string or "any" meaning "any type"
//
// Returns: String containing a (locally) unique identifier for the listener
webinos.addEventListener(cb, source, destination, type);

// Removes a listener
//
// Params:
//
// listener: Listener string returned by webinos.addEventListener()
//
// Returns: nothing
webinos.removeEventListener(listener);

// Sends an event
//
// Params:
//
// evt: Event object - must not contain forwardings
// cbs: optional EventCallbacks object
// expectResponse: optional boolean flag indicating whether a response to the message, other than a delivery notification, is expected (default: false)
// (this helps the WRE to prevent garbage collection of events that might be referenced by responses)
// sync: optional boolean flag indicating whether the call is going to be synchronous (true) or asynchronous (false) - (default: false)
//
// Returns: nothing
webinos.dispatchEvent(evt, cbs, expectResponse, sync);

// Forwards an event
//
// Params:
// evt: Event object
// to: array of objects repsenting the primary recipients of the forwarded event
// cc: optional array of objects repsenting the secondary recipients of the forwarded event
// bcc: optional array of objects repsenting the blind-carbon-copy recipients of the forwarded event (same rules as in Event)
// cbs: optional EventCallbacks object
// expectResponse: optional boolean flag indicating whether a response to the message, other than a delivery notification, is expected (default: false)
// sync: optional boolean flag indicating whether the call is going to be synchronous (true) or asynchronous (false) - (default: false)
// withTimestamp: optional boolean flag indicating whether to include a forwarding timestamp (default: false)
// withHistory: optional boolean flag indicating whether to include all the past forwarding history (default: false)
//
// Returns: nothing
webinos.forwardEvent(evt, to, bcc, cc, cbs, expectResponse, sync, withTimestamp, withHistory);
</code></pre>

h2. Rationale

** DOM inspired, non-DOM (e.g., no bubbling, capture), DOM wrapping possible
* function vs methods because of multiple recipients
* expectResponse for lifetime magic of past Event objects
* support for synchronous execution for synchronous API capable of remoting
* forwardEvent for checking event modification and implementation purposes

Open issues
-----------

-   Callbacks, exceptions and error code definitions (should be in alignment with all other Webinos APIs, consistency)
-   ID is only available after transmission….
-   Automatically ignoring messages (e.g., for canceling operations) to be supported at this level?
-   Amount of input validation?
-   (minimal) we could get better control of forwarding stuff if withHistory was something like an integer (number of forwardings to keep), but let’s keep things as simple as possible… no?
