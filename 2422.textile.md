Personal Zone API
-----------------

-   Some attributes enabling UI adaption overlap with Device Status API. As we shouldn’t have redundant APIs there is an **Action on Habib to remove those attributes from the Perzonal Zone API and submit input to Christian so that he can add those attributes to the Webinos Device Status API.**

-   More motivations for the Perzonal Zone API was requested and there is an **Action on Habib to add more motivation to the Perzonal Zone APi in http://dev.webinos.org/redmine/projects/t3-4/wiki/Core_Management_API_and_Use_Cases**

-   Alexander raised that there is a security issue with exposing PZP id and name to developers. **Action Habib to contact John on this issue**

Created http://dev.webinos.org/redmine/issues/929 to track these actions.

Device Status API
-----------------

-   There is an **Action on Christian to add the Webinos specific Aspects from the "Phase 1 device status vocabulary":http://dev.webinos.org/specifications/draft/vocabulary.html into the phase 2 device status API as well as other new Aspects that we discover a need for**.

-   **Action Christian to remove the link to the WAC devicestatus module on http://dev.webinos.org/specifications/new/ as we now have our own device status API.**

Created http://dev.webinos.org/redmine/issues/930 to track these actions.

Duplicated abstract and introduction sections in Webinos API specifications
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

-   This seems to be an effect of the updated specification toolchain due to the new W3C widl specification. **Action Claes to e-mail Dom on this issue**.

Error callbacks
---------------

* Each specification must have a unique name for it’s error callback and should as much as possible, re-use DOMError objects in error callbacks instead of minting new errors for each API. For example see http://dev.webinos.org/specifications/new/tv.html#::TVErrorCB in the TV Control API.
**Action for all editors to, if not already done, update error callbacks accordingly**

Synchronous methods
-------------------

-   It is not possible to implement synchronous API methods with the current implementation with Web Socket communication between WRT and PZP. **Action Andre to contact Nick on plans for synchronous communication between WRT and PZP**

Messaging API
-------------

Decided to remove the "synchronisable interface" as we see no use cases for it.

Sensor API
----------

Claes has a list up updates to be done and when done there is an **Action on Stefano V to add support for M2M sensors**, http://dev.webinos.org/redmine/issues/931.

Object Synchronization API
--------------------------

Martin has added this API to enable and manage application synchronization. **Action for Martin to provide background information**
