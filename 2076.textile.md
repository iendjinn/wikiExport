Threat Model and Trusted Components
-----------------------------------

In this section we describe the activities and actions that each of the core webinos components are trusted or explicitly _not_ trusted to perform. The value of this threat model is that it makes explicit the assumptions behind which components we are relying on and, therefore, how each may be exploited to attack the overall system. The threat model helped to inform the attack patterns and obstacles described in the risk analysis.

This trust model is taken from the perspective of a webinos personal zone user.

The following components are covered in this model:

-   Personal Zone Proxy (PZP)
-   Personal Zone Hub (PZH)
-   Identity Provider
-   Name resolution service
-   Platform: device + OS + other applications
-   Widget Renderer
-   Browser
-   Widget Processor
-   Applications

A complete list of potential actions and activities is given in the appendix. Some actions are generic and therefore a _modifier_ may exist to explain what this action refers to in this context. For example, "Storing data - confidentiality" may have the modifier "policies" referring to the fact that this component is trusted to store policies confidentially. This is represented as a separate column.

### Personal Zone Proxy (PZP)

Users need to trust the PZP to have almost complete control of the local device, and to access all _local_ APIs it provides. However, as designers should be wary of trusting every PZP absolutely. The inability of a PZP to protect itself against malware makes the possibility of a zone being hijacked by a rogue PZP extremely likely. It should also not be overly trusted for authenticating the end user: different devices will have different capabilities with regards to authenticating users.

There is also a significant threat from a device being joined into a malicious personal zone without the user’s knowledge. This is why it is trusted to maintain the integrity of certificates and policies.

  Access control via policy enforcement                                                               The PZP is the main area for policy enforcement
  Storing data - confidentiality                       policies, app data                             The PZP must be able to store policies without outside modification

  Handling device keys                                                                                Passing keys to the operating system to store

  Authenticating devices against device certificates                                                  PZPs may authenticate other PZPs and PZHs via their public key certificates
  Displaying information to the local user                                                            PZPs may present information to the user for policy enforcement or installation reasons
  Taking user input                                    Policy decisions, installation                 PZPs need to take access control decisions from users
  Routing                                              To the PZH                                     PZPs route data from applications to the PZH and peer-connected PZPs
  Creating sessions                                    To the PZH, other local PZPs                   PZPs establish TLS connections to other PZHs

  Untrusted Input validation                           incoming API requests and messages             PZPs must validate all input from web runtimes and browsers

  -------------------------------- ----------------- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Personal Zone Hub (PZH)

The Personal Zone Hub is trusted with some of the most important aspects of the personal zone. It is not given access to individual device private keys (this allows any device to implement its own storage and generation mechanism) or allowed to edit local policies on individual devices, but almost everything else is permitted.

  Handling device keys                               The PZH never receives the private keys created by PZPs
  -------------------------------- ----------------- ----------------------------------------------------------------

### Identity Provider (OpenID Provider)

We _require_ that the user has a trustworthy identity provider. However, the webinos framework has no way of enforcing this, and therefore must trust that users select an appropriate option. In addition, we have no mitigation for attacks resulting from flaws in OpenID

| Authenticating users to the local device | | |

### Name resolution service (WebFinger / User lookup service)

The name resolution service converts user identities into personal zone hub URLs. We assume that the name resolution service is either provided by a well known authority (such as webinos.org) or the identity provider themselves.

  Name resolution                           User email addresses to PZH URLs   This is the primary function of this entity
  Authenticating user’s online identities                                      Updating routing information requires authorisation from the correct user
  Revocation of devices                     PZH, not PZPs                      The name resolution service is used to revoke a PZH by linking to a different location
  ----------------------------------------- ---------------------------------- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Platform: device + OS + other applications

The webinos PZP software will run on an existing platform, including an operating system and applications. This is the source of many potential attacks, particularly related to malware. Device operating systems and applications are responsible for protecting themselves against malware. However, this is often shown not to be reasonable as new malware and vulnerabilities are published frequently. As such, a key threat is the presence of malware on a device and therefore on webinos.

|Storing keys | | webinos uses the key storage mechanisms provided by the platform |

|Storing data â€“ confidentiality | Application data, webinos platform data | |

  ----------------------------------------- ----------------- -----------------------------------------------------------

### Widget Renderer

The widget render displays widgets to the end user. They may be vulnerable to a wide range of attacks from malicious users or applications, including:

-   Shoulder-surfing attacks
-   Widgets could be designed to exploit the renderer code, either by modifying what is rendered or by launching attacks on the underlying system
-   XSS, CSRF, session hijacking

### Widget Processor

Widget processors unpack widget packages and install them onto the personal zone. They must be able to validate signatures and maintain records of trusted applications. A widget processor may be part of a widget runtime environment (WRT).

### Applications

Applications are generally not trusted with user data or APIs unless granted explicit permission. They can be a significant attack vector, as well as being attacked themselves.

Applications can be attacked through:

-   Content injection attacks such as XSS and CSRF
-   Code could be stolen by competing developers
-   Content could be stolen
-   Any tokens or secrets contained within the application may be stolen

Applications can be attack vectors:

-   Stealing user data
-   Privacy violations - monitoring, tracking
-   Acting as a botnet client
-   Denial of service attacks on the end user
-   Exploiting vulnerabilities in the renderers

We have not tried to account for attacks on content within the application.
