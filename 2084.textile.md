PZH Migration and Data Import/Export
====================================

Overview
--------

How does a user migrate their personal zone hub? This page will outline a proposal. The key concern is to allow users to move their personal zone between different zone hub providers, which enables portability and enhances privacy/user control. Users should also be able to download, backup or analyse their pzh-based data at any time.

Other interesting topics: [[PZP Migration]] - this will be relevant if webinos is not synchronising _all_ application and personal data between devices automatically.

### Requirements for migration

None originally, there is a new proposal here - http://dev.webinos.org/redmine/projects/wp2-4/wiki/Proposed_Update_Hub_Migration

It was decided via email discussion that MIGRATION would be a low-priority requirement,

_Normative_: Data Import and Export and Deletion
----------------------------------------------------------

### What data should be Exported by a PZH?

-   XACML policies. These may need to be transformed during migration to refer to the new PZH host (depending on identities)
-   Trusted identities - the known external users, devices and certificates.
-   CRLs - these will need to be recreated using the new PZH hostsâ€™ signing key, but the new CRL should include the contents of the old CRL
-   User settings, identities and profile data
-   Any analytic data stored by the PZH (e.g. context database)

### Import process

Algorithm / process for importing data. When is it allowed?

### Export process

Algorithm / process for exporting data. What is removed/changes in the exported data compared to the data stored by the hub? Hopefully nothing changes.

### Deleting a personal zone hub

What data ought to be deleted?

_Informative_: Migration Scenarios
--------------------------------------------

Note: there is some work on migration here in WP7 EuroPKI paper - http://dev.webinos.org/redmine/projects/wp7/repository/revisions/master/entry/AcademicPapers/EuroPKI/personal-pki.tex

### The migration process

### Devices reconnecting to the hub

### External devices/users connecting to the hub

How do we make sure they get the new hub address? Name resolution process, plus a 301 Moved Permanently

### Sequence diagrams: change of hub address

_Informative_: Security concerns
------------------------------------------

-   Ethan figures out a way to migrate personal zone hubs without needed to authenticate
-   Misuse of the export feature to obtain personal information - E.g. Frankie discovers he can export data from any hub
-   Migration results in a denial of service
-   When a new hub is set up, it becomes possible for anyone to join the personal zone at this stage
-   Users can be tricked into migrating their personal zone hub by malicious webpages or apps
-   The migration process leaks data - during migration, anyone can download / view /edit the data being transferred

Any privacy concerns?
