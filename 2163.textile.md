Data Security
-------------

The webinos platform uses and stores data which may have security and privacy requirements. For example, many of our personas may use webinos applications to monitor health data, to read personal emails, or to store valuable work files. As such, it is important to address threats and mitigations to vulnerabilities affecting data at rest.

Some of this analysis has been included in the main Architectural Risk Analysis process, but some still remains separate.

### Where and what data are stored in webinos?

#### Applications (The File API)

Applications may store data locally on each device, as well as using data (such as media files) exposed by each device. To support this, webinos provides the File API. The File API will expose to each application an application-specific, isolated storage area. In addition, the File API can also expose arbitrary data storage. However, access to arbitrary data storage will be mediated by policies and require a different permission. Isolated storage from one application is never exposed to another through webinos.

#### Local devices and PZPs

Each device with a PZP will store some or more of the following:

1.  Application data
2.  Data in policies, certificates, and preferences. This may include the names of applications the user has installed, the devices they use and their friends identities. It is therefore considered private.
3.  Browser histories and system logs
4.  Context data (a temporary log file), if enabled.
5.  Downloaded widget data containing potentially valuable intellectual property

#### Cloud-based components (PZH, online services)

Cloud-based components may store:

1.  Context data
2.  Data in policies, certificates, and preferences. This may include the names of applications the user has installed, the devices they use and their friends identities. It is therefore considered private.
3.  Application data (outside of webinos control)

This is discussed in more detail in the cloud security analysis section.

### What are the threats?

Two obstacles in the existing architectural analysis are relevant:

-   "Application data intercepted" - Application data from webinos widgets is intercepted in the widget renderer.
-   "Application data readable" - Application data from webinos widgets is readable outside of the widget renderer.

In addition, the following threats exist:

This may be targeted to particular apps or users   Irwin   Corporate espionage or discrediting an existing application. Monetary gain.
  Device theft             A webinos-enabled device is stolen and data is downloaded by the thief.                                                         David              Most likely selling the device, but this could be a targeted attack on an individual or corporation

### Mitigations

#### Webinos-provided mitigations

The webinos platform mitigates some of these threats in the following ways:

  ------------------------ ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  _.Threat            _.Mitigation
  Native malware           No mitigation
  Device theft             No mitigation
  webinos malware          Provide isolated storage for each application, require additional permissions to access shared areas
  Online data leak         Provide recommendations for PZH design to minimize risk, recommend key storage approaches, minimize data stored by the PZH
  App content theft        No mitigation
  Data removal blackmail   No mitigation
  ------------------------ ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

#### Device-provided mitigations

We suggest the following mitigations should be provided by webinos device platforms.

  ------------------------ --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  _.Threat            _.Mitigation
  Native malware           Provide anti-malware tools and allocate each native application in its own private storage area
  Device theft             Provide full disk encryption
  webinos malware          N/A
  Online data leak         PZH providers should provide disk encryption and should follow best practice guidelines to avoid vulnerabilites. Keys should be stored privately using either a trusted hardware device or a separate file system.
  App content theft        No mitigation
  Data removal blackmail   Offer backup and recovery tools.
  ------------------------ --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

As this table demonstrates, the majority of threats we suggest mitigating at the device level, not the webinos level.
