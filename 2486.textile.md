Conceptual Architecture
=======================

The webinos platform’s security and privacy goals are primarily achieved through the introduction of an _access control policy architecture_ based on [[Conceptual_Architecture#XACML|XACML]] integrated with extensions from [[Conceptual_Architecture#PrimeLife|PrimeLife]]

[JPL]: Could use some references to XACML and PrimeLife documentation. This might also let you delete explanations of what PrimeLife is => [SM]: done.

The main motivations behind the choice of the PrimeLife extension, other than the support of data-handling privacy policies are:
* Support for credential-based restrictions (digital credential and certified attributes)
* Legislation support (EU privacy directives)
* PrimeLife is an open-source European Project

[KW] Maybe some short explanation what PDP is? (or note, that it will be explained later) => [SM] Done

The complete architecture - the components for which are described and depicted below - contains, as well as than the XACML/PrimeLife components, a PZH and PZP defined in the high level webinos architecture and the PDPC (PDPCache) generally included in XACML’s PDP component. The architecture is composed of the following elements:

_**Access Requestor**_: the entity which requires and requests access to a resource. For example, an application may request access to a service defined by a webinos API.

_**Personal Zone Proxy (PZP)**_: defined in the preceding sections, in this context it can act in four ways:

1.  enforce authorization decisions at the device level
2.  synchronize request context data with other devices <span style="background:yellow">[JPL]: Can you rephrase this? I don’t understand what you mean.</span>
3.  synchronize PDP policies with other devices
4.  verify credentials towards the request context <span style="background:yellow">[JPL]: Can you rephrase this? I don’t understand what you mean.</span>

_**Personal Zone Hub (PZH)**_: defined in the preceding sections, in this context it can act in three ways:

1.  as a data synchronizer towards the request context (via PZP)
2.  as a policy synchronizer towards the PDP / PDPC (via PZP)
3.  as a credential system (responsible for credential verification) towards the request context (via PZP)

_**Decision Wrapper**_: responsible for driving the access control policy evaluation and enforcement.

_**Access Manager**_: the entity in charge of taking the final decision by combining the XACML access.
control and the DHDF data.

_**DHDF Engine**_: Data Handling Decision Function engine provides privacy and data handling functionalities.
It does not implement a complete privacy-aware access control system, but rather it is responsible for
the management and evaluation of data handling policies only.

_**Data Reader**_: responsible for abstracting the communication with the Request Context.

_**Request Context**_: responsible for managing all contextual information; it stores all the data and
credentials released by a user in a given session.

_**Policy Enforcement Point (PEP)**_: the entity that performs access control, by making decision requests and enforcing authorization decisions. It also tries to execute the Obligations and doesn’t grant access if is unable to complete these actions.

_**Policy Decision Point (PDP)**_: the main decision point for the access requests. It collects all the necessary information from other actors and concludes an authorization decision.

_**PDPC**_: the PDP cache, stores PDP decisions that could be share among personal devices.

_**Context Handler**_: the entity which sends a policy evaluation request to the PDP and manage context-based information.

_**Policy Information Point (PIP)**_: the entity that acts as a source of attribute values that are retrieved from several internal or external parties like resources, subjects, environment and so on.

_**Policy Administration Point (PAP)**_: the repository for the policies, it manages policies and provides them to the Policy Decision Point.

The data flow sequence is exposed by the three scenarios presented in the "Formal Specification" paragraph.

[JPL] No, it wont! :) => [SM] removed "More aspects on security and privacy will be pointed out in the 3.5 deliverable ([[Spec_-_Security#D035|D035]])

h2. Technical Use Cases

p(rev). [JPL] It might be worth asking Christian whether this part belongs in the specification or not… It’s useful information, but it isn’t specification material.

Here are depicted and briefly presented use-cases particularly relevant for the policy sub-task.

h3. WOS-UC-TA8-002: Interpreting policies and taking access control decisions

**Normal Flow**

**_Pre-Condition_**
The User has a tablet PC running webinos.
The User has a photo collection on his tablet PC which he would like to share with other people.
The webinos platform has a set of policies installed. These are not contradictory- a decision can always be taken based on their content.

**_Flow_**
1. The User has installed a new photo-sharing Application.
2. The photo-sharing Application automatically tries to upload his photos to a shared repository.
3. Accessing photos stored on the webinos Device - his tablet pc - results in an access-control request to the webinos platform.
4. webinos takes the event (Application X accessing File F) and checks against the set of policies (PS) installed.
5. The policies allow this action, and the photo-sharing app resumes uploading photos.

**_Post-Condition_**
The correct access control decision is taken with respect to all policies.

**Alternate Flow (optional)**

**_Pre-Condition_**
Same as normal flow.

**_Post-Condition_**
5. The policies do not allow this action and the Application is not able to upload any files.
6. The Application fails gracefully, informing the User of why it is unable to complete the request.
7. The access control decision is logged.

**Alternate Flow (optional)**
**_Pre-Condition_**
Same as normal flow.

**_Post-Condition_**
5. The policies require an extra condition before allowing this action: in this case, requesting User input to confirm that this behaviour is permitted.
6. webinos prompts the User to confirm that access to photos is allowed.
7. The User agrees.
8. The photo-sharing Application resumes uploading photos.

### WOS-UC-TA8-003: Enforcing multiple policies on multiple devices

**Normal Flow**
**_Flow_**
1. The User has a Mobile phone and an in-car entertainment System.
2. The User decides that he does not want to alert local networks to his presence.
3. He uses webinos to specify that his Devices should remain hidden and not discoverable. He does this on his Mobile phone.

**_Post-Condition_**
Any webinos Device used by the User subsequently will not be discoverable by a remote network. This includes his car whenever he is using it.

**Alternate Flow**
**_Pre-Condition_**
A User has both personal and work photos on his webinos Device.

**_Flow_**
1. The User uses a Mobile phone provided by his company, a professional photography business.
2. He has configured it to allow him to share personal information with certain social networking Applications.
3. One of the Applications encourages the sharing of personal photos.
4. He does not see a problem with sharing the photos on his Device, and proceeds, allowing the potential upload of all photos on his Device.
5. However, the company policy protects all the photos owned by the company, many of which he has inadvertently given permission to. These are forbidden from being used by non-trusted Applications.
6. The webinos policy engine interprets the User’s policy and the company policy - knowing that the company, as the phone’s owner, takes precedence - and denies access to the relevant photos.

**_Post-Condition_**
The User can only share his own photos with his social network Application, not any of the company’s copyrighted photos.

### WOS-UC-TA8-007: Policy authoring tools

**Normal Flow**
**_Pre-Condition_**
The Developer’s company has ownership of company Devices and is able to set policies which cannot be overridden by the End Users.

**_Flow_**
1. The Developer knows that webinos policies are written in a standard language and he downloads a webinos policy editing tools to help him create a suitable policy for his requirements.
2. He uses the tool to select the class of assets which she is concerned about - all data owned by the company.
3. He then sets a mandatory policy that this data is not allowed to be shared with any Application not signed by the company. All access to the data should also be logged.
4. He also selects a default policy for personal data, stating that it should not be shared with Applications by default.
5. The Developer modifies various other settings until he is happy with the policy.
6. The tool provides several examples of how his policy would be applied, and what it allows and denies access to.
7. He then tests his policy against several example Device configurations that the tool supports. This shows him that Devices using his policy would still be able to run, but would not be able to access company data.
8. He saves the policy and signs it to mark it as a trusted company policy.

**_Post-Condition_**
The company policy can be applied to all Devices the company owns and will control webinos Applications in the ways defined by the Developer.

**Alternate Flow (optional)**
**_Flow_**
7. The Developer tests the policy and realizes that it prevents Applications from accessing any data on the Devices. This is shown to him using the policy tool.
8. He realizes his mistake and modifies the policy suitably.
