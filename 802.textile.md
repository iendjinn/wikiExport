Webinos Context Framework
=========================

Conceptual Architecture
-----------------------

The webinos context framework provides context access to other context-driven webinos applications/services. The framework is responsible for context collection, storage, reasoning, querying, etc. requested by context-driven webinos applications and services. In addition, this context framework is closely coupled with the webinos policy and privacy enforcement framework in order to ensure secure handling of the often highly sensitive context data that is stored.

Technical Use Cases
-------------------

### Use case: Which device to use to view my photo album?

Up to now, connections over social networking platforms can be described across two broad areas:
# Connecting with people through some social media platform, i.e. friending or un-friending someone, following and un-following, asking and receiving answers, subscribing, or un-subscribing to his stream, retransmitting or replying to someoneâ€™s posts, etc.
# Connecting with content-items on some social media platforms, i.e. liking a page, posting a status update, commenting on a post, sharing a link, tagging a photo, rating a review or a video, rsvp-ing to an event, etc.

The collection of all connections for a profile constitutes the profileâ€™s social graph. In the majority of online social networking sites, the underlying social graph does not contain the concept of a â€œdeviceâ€ as an endpoint in a social connection. This is expected since the device is the technological medium through which any user - when authorized - can create social connections with other users or items (as shown above). As a result we have very little knowledge on the â€œconnectionâ€ a user may have with a particular device. Yet, in the (near) future, we will be able to access and use applications that work across devices allowing us to have an uninterrupted usage experience. Capabilities such as migrating the session of an application from one device to another or seamlessly accessing and sharing content among applications running on different devices that (could) belong to different users are in the core of several research initiatives today. Having the capability to use applications across devices allows the connections that users maintain among themselves to be propagated to their set of owned devices too.

Letâ€™s try and see a potential use case of this situation. It is Friday afternoon, Lia with a couple of her colleagues step into a bar across their office building to have some drinks before the weekend starts. George, who works in the same area, is also there with some colleagues for drinks. Lia and George have never met before. That afternoon the two companies sit side by side. Lia and George meet, they start talking, have some drinks, and quickly the two companies mix. Lia uses her smart-phone to take some pictures of the whole company having fun together. She creates a new album "Friday Evening Happy Hour". Lia has this new application installed on her device called "CrazyHats" which uses photos from an album and puts funny looking hats on the persons in it. Using the application she puts some funny looking hats on a photo of her and George. After modifying the picture, she clicks the "share" button to share it with George. She gets several options, i.e. share in Facebook, share in Twitter, send as email, share with another device. As they have just met, Lia does not have any connection with George through her social networks. So she clicks the â€œshare with another deviceâ€ option. Her phone discovers George’s tablet among a number of other devices of their friends who are nearby and have enabled bluetooth discovery. She selects it, the handshake is completed and she passes him the photo. After a couple of hours, the evening at the bar comes to an end and George invites all the company to continue the evening at his house which is nearby. The company heads over to George’s house. In the meanwhile Lia has processed all the photos in the "Friday Evening Happy Hour" album using â€œCrazyHatsâ€ and now all the members of the company have funny hats on them in the photos. George thinks it will be fun for everyone to see the pictures together. Since Lia’s smart-phone has a very small screen, so they decide to use George’s HD TV to view the photos. Lia selects the album on her device and again she hits the "share" button. This time George’s TV comes right on top of the list with a small label "suggested device" next to it. She selects this option, George approves it and soon the whole company watches their photos on high definition.

Formal Specification
--------------------

### Context API Component

### Context Storage Component

The Context Storage component deals with storing and returning contextual data. Based on the diversity of devices and operating systems which are to be supported by the webinos platform, pinpointing a specific storage technology and bringing it to all devices/platforms is nearly impossible. This is why, the component operates a connector model in order to make the storage operations independent from the underlying datase and operating system. As already mentioned, the design decision is made in support of system portability and flexibility. By providing additional connector implementations, the Context Storage component can connect to various types of database technologies (e.g. relational databases, graph databases, triple stores, etc.). Connectors can be created by the third party webinos developers and should be deployable at runtime.

<pre><code>
Interface ContextStorage{

StoreConnector connect(in string connectorID);

StoreConnector connect(in string connectorID, in object properties);

object getConnectors();
};

Interface StoreConnector{

boolean execute(in string statement);

object executeQuery(in string query);

int executeUpdate(in string update);

object getStatus();

void close();
};
</code></pre>

Store connectors can be implemented for traditional relational database management systems (RDBMS) such as SQLite or MySQL. On the other hand, this approach also supports but does not enforces the use of storage mechanisms optimized for context-data persistence. Graph databases for example are a type of NoSQL database. The graph database approach differs from RDBMSs as it uses oriented graph structures to store data rather than in tables. All information is represented by means of the graph’s nodes, edges, and properties. Nodes are used to represent entities, whilst properties can be added to provide additional information regarding an entity. In turn, the edges define node-to-node and node-to-property connections and thus represent a certain relationship between the two connected items.

+ High flexibility by allowing nodes with dynamic properties to be linked arbitrarily to other nodes.
+ High scalability of NOSQL databases.
- Lower efficiency in batch processing compared to RDBMSs.

An other example of database systems optimized for context storage are triple stores. As with graph databases, triple stores also rely on graph structures for storing data. In particular, triple stores provide an optimized mechanism for the persistent storage of RDF triples. Compared to graph databases, where focus are mainly the characteristics of the graph (e.g. distances, reachability, etc.), triple stores mainly aim for optimized query processing and knowledge inference. The built-in support for semantics and formal RDF inference rules provides better means to extract new triples. The main language for performing RDF queries is SPARQL (Simple Protocol and RDF Query Language). SPARQL is standardized by the W3C RDF Data Access Working Group (DAWG). It enables flexible queries consisting of triple patterns, conjunction/disjunction patterns, as well as optional patterns.

+ Both data format and query language are standardized.
+ Unlike RDBMSs, triple stores are optimized for intensive use of query and insertion operations.
- The development of triple stores is still in its inital phase. Lots of triple stores are built on top of traditinoal RDBMSs, possibly introducing performance issues.

### Context Reasoner Component

Context reasoning is needed in order to infer new facts from instance data and class descriptions in the Context Storage. The reasoners are thus the objects that perform the task of deriving additional information. The reasoning process allows the system to derive higher-level context data, by combining lower-level knowledge originating from device sensors, or applications. The reasoning component is pluggable, supporting the addition of specialized reasoning capabilities that are optimized for a specific task and/or environment.

![](http://www.wafl.ugent.be/webinos/high-level-context.png)

First of all, there is often a need for sensor data fusion. This action aims at integrating different context sources in order to make the available knowledge more reliable. A well known example is the integration of location-aware sources. A user’s location can be obtained from various sources: GPS positioning, cell tower triangulation, IP geolocation lookup, etc. All these source have varying accuracies, ranging from a few meters to several kilometers. Especially when users own multiple devices, sensor data fusion can be used to further enhance the precision of contextual data such as location. Context reasoning is a challenging task, as there must be a mechanism in support of mapping lower-level context data to higher-level knowledge. Context reasoners in general rely on two approaches for mapping different levels of context data: the use of ontologies (e.g. OWL), and the use of probabilistic reasoning to produce probabilistic models.

<pre><code>
Interface Reasoner {

Reasoner bindOntology(in object axioms);

void run();

object getStatus();

object getInferenceResults();

void setProperty(in string key, in object value);
};
</code></pre>

A number of good RDF/OWL reasoners are already available. For example Pellet, an advanced OWL reasoner. The Jena Reasoner on the other hand provides an extensible, which allows a wide range of inference engines/reasoners to be plugged into the Jena platform.
