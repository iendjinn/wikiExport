Preliminary investigation
=========================

In the followings is reported a preliminary investigation about the oAuth topic.

While developing webinos applications, the need of having an authentication mechanism against third party, provided by webinos framework, has been brought up by developers.

The first solutions taken into account were authentication mechanisms that were handled completely by the application and acts as a authentication client. These solutions has so many limitations, in terms of requests number, that were dropped bu developer.
According to a further investigation, the only limitless authentication mechanism ends up to be the implementation of an oAuth service.

### Issues of a draft implementation

In order to implement the above proposed solution, an undocumented version of the oAuth API was implemented with some security risks:
* application keys/secret were held by the application, peered with the user key/secrets
**** cannot change user at run-time
* keys and secrets are exposed
**** easy to retrieve and hard to identity substitution
**** easy to use application key/secret for a malware application

Proposed solution
-----------------

### The developer server

On preliminary investigation, it turns out that all the applications that are nowadays available in every kind of market are meant to hold the pair keys/secret, that authenticates the registered app, inside the application itself.
That’s a solution that is feasible, if the hosting market has some kind of control mechanisms as barriers to entry. In that case a malware application wouldn’t last long.

Considering our Webinos case study, a deep inspection for apps as barrier to entry in an hypothetical Webinos market isn’t taken into consideration, yet. Moreover, this kind of supervisory is motivated in a commercial project where this kind of control can influence revenues, where, on the other hand, it’s way less appealing in an opensource project.

On a further investigation, the need of having the keys hosted externally and the implementation of a webservice that provides authentication seemed quite clear. Hence, the entity of the devServer came out.
This new entity will be able to provide authentication against every service that requires oAuth authentication. It turns out quite soon that the need of different kind of implementation were needed in order to support different versions of oAuth that behave in a completely different way.

The investigation aforementioned in the following is related to oAuth 1.0A, the one that tries to fulfill developers request for Twitter authentication.
Of course, version is something that needs to be evaluated for providing authentication, for instance to support other social media with Facebook, which use on the other hand oAuth 2.0.

### oAuth 1.0a vs 2.0

In the following are mentioned the main differences between oAuth 1.0A (the ‘A’ stands for a minor revision to the 1.0 protocol version that came out to fix a security bug right after oAuth started spreading) and the newest protocol version: oAuth 2.0. Mainly it’s what oAuth 2.0 adds.

-   6 New Flows
    -   User-Agent Flow â€“ for clients running inside a user-agent (typically a web browser).
    -   Web Server Flow â€“ for clients that are part of a web server application, accessible via HTTP requests. This is a simpler version of the flow provided by OAuth 1.0.
    -   Device Flow â€“ suitable for clients executing on limited devices, but where the end-user has separate access to a browser on another computer or device.
    -   Username and Password Flow â€“ used in cases where the user trusts the client to handle its credentials but it is still undesirable for the client to store the userâ€™s username and password. This flow is only suitable when there is a high degree of trust between the user and the client.
    -   Client Credentials Flow â€“ the client uses its credentials to obtain an access token. This flow supports what is known as the 2-legged scenario.
    -   Assertion Flow â€“ the client presents an assertion such as a SAML assertion to the authorization server in exchange for an access token.
    -   Native application support (applications running on a desktop or mobile device) can be implemented using many of the flows above.

-   Bearer tokens:
    OAuth 2.0 provides a cryptography-free option for authentication which is based on existing cookie authentication architecture. Instead of sending signed requests using HMAC and token secrets, the token itself is used as a secret sent over HTTPS. This allows making API calls using cURL and other simple scripting tools without having to canonicalize the request and sign it.

-   Simplified signatures:
    Signature support has been significantly simplified to remove the need for special parsing, encoding, and sorting of parameters. It also uses a single secret instead of two.

-   Short-lived tokens with Long-lived authorizations:
    Instead of issuing a long lasting token (typically good for a year or unlimited lifetime), the server can issues a short-lived access token and a long lived refresh token. This allows clients to obtain a new access token without having to involve the user again, but keeps access tokens limited. This feature was adopted from Yahoo!â€™s BBAuth protocol and later its OAuth 1.0 Session Extension.

-   Separation of Roles:
    OAuth 2.0 separates the role of the authorization server responsible for obtaining user authorization and issuing tokens from that of the resource server handling API calls.

It is quite clear that this last revision has added relevant features. Nevertheless, for simplicity and requirements the 1.0A version has been addressed for this investigation. It’s still valid the aforementioned statement that implies that a real devServer implementation should support 2.0 protocol version.

### Issues to overcome

-   Same domain Policy (source "W3C":http://www.w3.org/Security/wiki/Same_Origin_Policy):

For all such resources, no loss of security would result (and much flexibility would be gained) from adding the ***Access-Control-Allow-Origin:*** header to all responses.??

-   Traffic load
-   where does this belong to?
    -   should it be hosted inside the PZH? (DDoS attach would be feasible that way. This would be adding a vulnerability)
    -   should it be completely demanded to the developer? (less appealing for devs)

Final considerations
--------------------

The above investigation clarifies some doubts, but on the other hand rises up some questions.

The oAuth 1.0A protocol, therefore its Twitter implementation, doesn’t provide a session token. Hence, devServer takes part into the communication way more than we were expecting.
Traffic load and denial of service attacks must be analyzed and considered a pragmatic risk.

Finally, it is clear that demanding the devServer full implementation to the developers would probably ends up in too much to take on board for the kind of developers Webinos project it’s aiming to reach out.
On the other hand, hosting its functionality inside the PZH would bring up a lot of security risks that needs to be evaluated by a deep security investigation.
One solution could be to create a new entity to be added to the Webinos entities pool.
On the other hand a good compromise could be to let the implementation to developers, but helping them by providing a security analysis, specification and an implementation example for each oAuth version we’re aiming to support.
