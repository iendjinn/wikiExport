TLS Servers on the PZH
----------------------

| Port | |
| Description | Incoming connections from PZPs (zone devices) as well as connections from external (friend) PZHs. |
| Parameters | rejectUnauthorized = false, requestCert = true |
| Trusted certificates | PZP certificates & trusted external (connection) PZH certificates |
|/3. Authentication | Entities with self-signed certificates are assumed to be new PZPs. The enrolment process is documented …. |
 | Entities with PZH certificates are assumed to be a device within that user’s PZH |
 | Entities with PZP certificates are assumed to be zone devices |

Outgoing TLS connections on the PZH
-----------------------------------

| Port | |
| Description | Outgoing connections to other PZHs |
| Parameters | |
| Trusted certificates | Just the certificate of the PZH we are contacting. May not be entirely trusted |
|/2. Authentication | The remote party must use the certificate we are expecting |
 | Any incoming data from this connection must be mapped to the user of the PZH we are connecting to. They may not be trusted to do anything else. |

TLS Servers on the PZP
----------------------

| Port | |
| Description | Incoming connections from PZPs (zone devices) as well as connections from external (friend) PZPs. |
| Parameters | rejectUnauthorized = false |
| Trusted certificates | PZP certificates & trusted external PZH master certificates |
|/3. Authentication | Entities with PZP certificates we don’t recognise must go through the peer-to-peer certificate exchange process, documented … |
 | Entities with PZP certificates from other zones are assumed to belong to the user connected to the PZH CA certificate in the chain |
 | Entities with PZP certificates from the personal zone are assumed to be the same user |

Outgoing TLS connections on the PZP
-----------------------------------

| Port | |
| Description | Outgoing connections to other PZPs |
| Parameters | |
| Trusted certificates | Just the certificate of the PZP we are contacting, if they are known. If not, then just our own CA certificate. |
|/4. Authentication | The remote party must use the certificate we are expecting, if we are expecting one. |
 | If the remote party is new (e.g. we have not connected to them before, no certificate known) follow the peer-to-peer certificate exchange process, documented … ) |
 | The remote party must be a PZP, not a PZH. |
 | The remote party user identity must be mapped to the identity of its master CA certificate |
