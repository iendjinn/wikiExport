Web Application API landscape
=============================

This page provides an overview of existing API standardization and collaboration projects.

World Wide Web Consortium (W3C)
-------------------------------

The "World Wide Web Consortium (W3C)":http://www.w3.org/ is an international community where Member organizations, a full-time staff, and the public work together to develop Web standards. W3C’s mission is "to lead the Web to its full potential". W3C is the most important organization for standardizing web technology and an extensive set of APIs for web application developers have been specified by W3C.

**W3C Web Applications (Web Apps) Working Group**

The W3C Web Applications WG provides specifications that enable improved client-side application development on the Web, including specifications both for application programming interfaces (APIs) for client-side development and for markup vocabularies for describing and controlling client-side application behavior.

This WG hosts a number of API specifications that are core for the web as an application execution environment. APIs that are implemented in all browers are for example XMLHTTPRequest and Document Object Model (DOM). Other important APIs created by the Web Apps WG that are deployed in modern browers are for example Web Workers, Web Messaging, File Reading, Server-Sent Events and Web Sockets. The Web Apps WG has also created a set of specifications for installable web applications, Web Widgets, that for example are core specifications in web runtime platforms such as "WAC":http://www.wacapps.net/web/portal/wac-2.0-spec.

See "Web Apps WG charter":http://www.w3.org/2010/webapps/charter/Overview.html and "Web Apps WG Web Site":http://www.w3.org/2008/webapps/. A full list of the WG’s publications and their status can be found at "Web Apps WG publications":http://www.w3.org/2008/webapps/wiki/PubStatus.

**W3C Device APIs (DAP) Working Group**

The mission of the Device APIs Working Group is to create client-side APIs that enable the development of Web Applications that interact with device hardware, services and applications such as the camera, microphone, system sensors, native address books, calendars and native messaging applications. Devices in this context include desktop computers, laptop computers, mobile Internet devices (MIDs), cellular phones, TVs, cameras and other connected devices. See the "DAP WG charter":http://www.w3.org/2011/07/DeviceAPICharter.

A full list of API specifications created by the WG is here: "DAP Roadmap":http://www.w3.org/2009/dap/#roadmap.

Given the sensitive nature of the data and sensors to which these APIs grant access, the Working Group also aims at crafting APIs that are both secure and privacy-enabling by design, based on the current Web browser security model. This entails reusing existing browser-based security metaphors where they apply and looking into innovative security and privacy mechanisms where they donâ€™t.

DAP’s public web site is here: "W3C DAP":http://www.w3.org/2009/dap/.

**W3C System Applications Working Group**

The System Applications Working Group is chartered to define a runtime environment, security model, and associated APIs for building Web applications with comparable capabilities to native applications. This requires stronger integration with the host platform than is the case for traditional web pages.

The main distinction between the scope of the DAP WG ("APIs for browser based Web Applications), and the System Applications WG ("APIs for System Web Applications") is the security model. Browsers are designed to cope with the user visiting untrusted web sites, necessitating a cautious approach to security that narrowly limits what a particular website can do. The line is drawn at "more harmful than what is tolerable inside a sandbox". The contrast between the two contexts can be illustrated by comparing a) an application with limited access to specific fields in the user’s contacts, and b) an application that implements a contacts manager, where the application is entrusted with the ability to access, create, delete and update entries. See "System Applications WG Draft charter":http://www.w3.org/2012/05/sysapps-wg-charter.html.

**W3C Web Intents task force**

Web Intents is a service discovery mechanism and light-weight RPC system between web apps, modeled after the similarly-named API in Android. In W3C a joint DAP WG / Web Apps WG task force is running. See "W3C Web Intents wiki":http://www.w3.org/wiki/WebIntents and "W3C Web Intents public mailing list archive":http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-web-intents/.

Google is the main driving player for Web Intents and is editor of the "W3C draft Web Intents specification":http://dvcs.w3.org/hg/web-intents/raw-file/tip/spec/Overview.html. They also manage the "webintents.org site":http://webintents.org/ that contains use cases and examples of Web Intents services.

In addition Sony has provided the "Web Intents Addendum - Local Services specification":http://w3c-test.org/dap/wi-addendum-local-services/ that defines how Services on Web Intents enabled UPnP and mDNS devices can be discovered and accessed.

Web Intents based APIs are under development within W3C and currently there are the following drafts:

-   "Pick Media Intent":http://w3c-test.org/dap/gallery/ (Web Intents based Gallery API)

-   "Pick Contacts Intent":http://w3c-test.org/dap/contacts/ (Web Intents based Contacts API)

For more information on Web Intents see the "Web Intents for webinos investigation" section in this delivery.

**W3C Geolocation Working Group**

The mission of the Geolocation Working Group is to define a secure and privacy-sensitive Geolocation API for accessing location information from device GPS receiver or network positioning information as well as a Device Orientation Event specification for using device orientation information originating from device accelerometer, magnetometer and gyro.

The Geolocation API is currently implemented in major modern web browsers and according to public information the Device Orientation Event specification is at least implemented in iOs browser, Android browser, Chrome, Firefox for Android and Opera Mobile for Android.

See the "Geolocation WG Charter":http://www.w3.org/2008/geolocation/charter/charter-2.

**W3C Web Real-Time Communications (Web-RTC) Working Group**

The mission of the recently formed Web Real-Time Communications Working Group is to define client-side APIs to enable Real-Time Communications in Web browsers. APIs specified by the WG will enable streaming access to device capabilities, e.g camera and microphone, and API functions for establish peer-to-peer connections between Web browsers, independent of the network protocols used to establish the connections between peers.

See "Web-RTC Working Group Charter":http://www.w3.org/2011/04/webrtc-charter.html and "Web-RTC web site":http://www.w3.org/2011/04/webrtc/

**Other W3C actvities creating APIs for web applications**

-   The "HTML5 specification":http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/ contains a number of APIs for web applications, e.g. an API for playing of video and audio to be used with the video and audio elements, an API that enabling offline Web applications and a drag & drop API.

-   The "Web Notifications API":http://www.w3.org/TR/notifications/ is an API for displaying simple notifications to the user.

-   The "Web Events Working Group":http://www.w3.org/2010/webevents/ develops specifications for physical multitouch interface events.

-   The "HTML Speech Incubator Group":http://www.w3.org/2005/Incubator/htmlspeech/ investigates the feasibility of integrating speech technology in HTML5.

-   The Near Field Communications (NFC) Working Group is being chartred. NFC is a form of short range wireless communication in which NFC devices such as mobile can communicate with each other over a typical distance of 4cm or less. See "W3C NFC WG draft charter":http://www.w3.org/2012/05/nfc-wg-charter.html.

-   The Audio Working Group is chartered to develop specifications which define a client-side script API adding more advanced audio capabilities than are currently offered by audio elements. See "W3C Audio WG charter":http://www.w3.org/2011/audio/charter/.

-   The Web Web Cryptography Working Group defines a high-level API providing common cryptographic functionality to Web Applications. See "W3C Web Web Cryptography Working Group charter":http://www.w3.org/2011/11/webcryptography-charter.html

This document summarizes the various technologies developed in W3C that increase the capabilities of Web applications, and how they apply more specifically to the mobile context.

Web Hypertext Application Technology Working Group (WHATWG)
-----------------------------------------------------------

"WHATWG":http://www.whatwg.org/ is a community of people interested in evolving the Web. It focuses primarily on the development of HTML and APIs needed for Web applications. The WG was founded by individuals of Apple, the Mozilla Foundation, and Opera Software in 2004, due to concerns on the W3Câ€™s direction with HTML and XHTML.

WHATWG has provided major input to the W3C HTML5 specification as well as to other specifications relating to web applications, e.g. Web Workers, Web Storage, the Web Sockets API, and Server-Sent Events.

WHATWG is a "W3C Community Group":http://www.w3.org/community/about/#cg.

Mozilla Web API / Firefox Mobile OS (Boot To Gecko)
---------------------------------------------------

Mozilla has launched the "Boot to Gecko project":http://www.mozilla.org/en-US/b2g/about/ to create a true Web-based Mobile Platform, i.e. a browser based Operating System built entirely on HTML5, Javascript and CSS without the need for an intermediate OS layer.

The Boot to Gecko project is based on standard APIs but when standards are missing (including telephony, SMS, camera, bluetooth, USB and NFC), they are working with standards bodies and other vendors to create them. This work is driven in the "Mozilla Web API project":https://wiki.mozilla.org/WebAPI.

Tizen
-----

"Tizen":https://www.tizen.org/ provides an operating system and applications based on HTML5. The Tizen SDK and API allow developers to use HTML5 and related web technologies to write applications that run across multiple device segments including smartphones, tablets, netbooks, in-vehicle infotainment devices, smart TVs, and more.

The Tizen project resides within the "Linux Foundation":http://www.linuxfoundation.org/collaborate/labs/tizen.

Tizen both uses W3C API specifications and defines their own additional APIs, e.g. Phone Call API, Bluetooth API, Media Content (Gallery) API and NFC API. See "Tizen documentation":https://developer.tizen.org/documentation.

Wholesale Application Community (WAC)
-------------------------------------

The "Wholesale Applications Community (WAC)":http://www.wacapps.net/ started as an open global alliance made up of leading communications companies including network operators, device and network equipment manufacturers, that was committed to make it easier for developers to innovate by using operator network APIs delivered by a single cross-operator API platform. Concentrating in Asia for now, WAC also supports an HTML5 based application platform.

WAC has now been folded into the GSMA, the mobile industry trade body. The technology side of WAC’s work is being split off and bought by "Apigee":http://www.zdnet.com/blog/gardner/sonoa-becomes-apigee-offers-new-and-rebranded-api-management-and-analysis-product-lines/3868, an API management firm. As part of the deal, Apigee will continue to develop the WAC web runtime and APIs and provide them back to the operators as a managed service.

WAC’s current focus is a "Payment API":http://www.wacapps.net/payment-api supporting operator billing through users phone bill.

Full list of WAC specifications can be found here:
* "WAC Specifications 2.1":http://specs.wacapps.net/
* "WAC 1.0":http://specs.wacapps.net/1.0/dec2010/

PhoneGap
--------

"PhoneGap":http://www.phonegap.com/ allows developers to build applications with web technology that are wrapped into native applications suited for the target platform giving access to APIs provided by the native platform. PhoneGap is now an Apache Foundation project under the name "Cordova":http://phonegap.com/2012/03/19/phonegap-cordova-and-what%E2%80%99s-in-a-name/.

The following table lists the APIs available for the platforms supported by PhoneGap: "PhoneGap supported feature":http://www.phonegap.com/features. For API documentation see "PhoneGap API reference":http://docs.phonegap.com/.

Google Chrome extension APIs
----------------------------

Google Chrome Extensions are applications, created with html, css and JS, that run inside the Chrome browser and provide additional functionality, integration with third party websites or services, and customized browsing experiences. These extensions can use a set of APIs such as chrome.bookmarks and chrome.tab to interact with the browser. See "Chrome APIs":http://developer.chrome.com/extensions/api_index.html and "Chrome experimental APIs":http://developer.chrome.com/extensions/experimental.html.

Nokia/Symbian Web Runtime environment
