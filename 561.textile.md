Relevant requirements
---------------------

### PS-USR-Oxford-41

The creation of device discovery policies SHALL support the specification of policies that are conditionally enforced across all of the user’s devices.

### PS-USR-Oxford-112

The webinos Runtime Environment SHALL be capable of specifying fine-grained security policies on all features of devices and user data.

### PS-USR-Oxford-106

When installing or using an application for the first time, webinos SHALL make sure that the user trusts the source of the application

### PS-USR-Oxford-111

The webinos Runtime Environment SHALL make explicit what contextual and personal information is shared by applications and the runtime and allow users to prevent it from happening

### PS-USR-Oxford-30

webinos shall allow user data to be marked as "personal" in order to specify policies on it.

### PS-USR-Oxford-54

webinos policies SHALL be able to refer to stored data

### PS-USR-Oxford-55

webinos policies SHALL be able to refer to personal profile information

### PS-DEV-Oxford-86

The webinos runtime SHALL support the confidential storage of user credentials including usernames and passwords

### PS-DEV-ambiesense-15

It MUST be possible to define context information as public, shared, or private.

### PS-USR-Oxford-35

webinos access control policies shall be able to specify fine-grained controls involving the source and content of an access control request

### PS-USR-ambiesense-27

It SHALL be possible for a policy to apply to all devices associated with a user. These policies may refer to restrictions on downloaded content owned by a third-party content provider

### PS-USR-Oxford-43

A more privileged user (or owner) shall be able to specify a policy which overrides a less-privileged user.

### PS-USR-Oxford-48

The authenticity and integrity of policies shall be enforced

### PS-USR-Oxford-73

The webinos System SHALL support policies which can be remotely updated

### PS-USR-Oxford-81

webinos SHALL support outsourced policy management

### PS-USR-ISMB-036

The webinos Runtime SHALL support the download, install, update and removal of security policies. These operations SHALL require authorisation by the user and policies MUST be checked for authenticity and integrity.

### PS-DEV-ambiesense-25

The webinos runtime SHALL protect policies from tampering or modification by unauthorised applications. The only authorised applications SHALL be from signed, trusted sources, which may be defined by the manufacturer, network provider or end user. Users SHALL be warned if an application requests permission to modify policies.

### PS-USR-Oxford-69

Users SHALL be informed of any intended access to critical APIs used by a webinos application at install time.

### PS-USR-Oxford-122

webinos applications SHALL only be capable of accessing remote scripts and executables IF those remote scripts are from an authenticated source AND the authenticated source is trusted in the platform policy

### PS-USR-Oxford-116

The webinos Runtime Environment SHALL protect applications and itself from potentially malicious applications and SHALL protect the device from being made unusable or damaged by applications.

Main security concerns
----------------------

-   complete mediation of policies - no requests are ignored
-   integrity of policies both when communicated and at rest
-   conflicting policies: sensible results despite conflicts
-   authenticity of policies
-   policies for vendor-provided functionality / proprietary APIs (e.g. enforcing the device manufacturer’s policy)
-   authorisation of policy creation
-   avoiding policies which result in a denial of service
-   policy interface should avoid bridging all applications (e.g. no common point of failure)
-   ability to outsource policy management should not expose the policy administration point to unauthorised external parties

Main Privacy concerns
---------------------

-   Privacy of the policies themselves - they will refer to private data and may unintentionally disclose personal details or behaviour.
-   Not over-prompting the user (allowing the user to be left alone)
-   Policies referring to identities should be protected from disclosure

Planned mitigations
-------------------

-   Protection of policy files: separation from the rest of the platform
-   Signing of downloaded policies
-   Signing of remote policy modifications, including device and user credentials
-   Limiting visibility of policies to applications
-   Usable policy management interfaces?

Example security policies
-------------------------

Missing requirements
--------------------

-   User identity switching - a lightweight method of changing who you are on a device
-   More detail about policy aspects
-   Remote management of company data
-   …
