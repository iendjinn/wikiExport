Context Management
==================

This is currently work-in-progress.

Main premise
------------

The webinos context framework provides access to contextualized data in order to enable the design and operation of context-driven webinos applications/services.

The framework is responsible for collecting and storing context data (through the identification of specific context related events that happen within webinos enabled devices) and providing applications with a layer to access such data either by querying against the storage or by being notified in real time for context changes (when specific events happen).

The current state of implementation
-----------------------------------

The Context Manager’s key functionality can be summed up in the following points:

-   Automatically keeps a log of all RPC calls, stripped from the parameters and results to the PZP in a locally stored log.json file.
-   Contains the Webinos Context Vocabulary, which is a description of the APIs, their methods exposed to the WRT, the expected structure of their parameters and the expected structure of their results, structured under Context Objects that would produce similar contextual information (e.g. MyLocation is a the same Context Object irrespective of whether it is produced by Geolocation API’s getCurrentPosition, watchPosition or from a call the Vehicle’s API GPS functionality).
-   Automatically intercepts RPC calls of API methods.
-   Automatically intercepts the registration of listeners and tracks the callbacks in order to match them to the corresponding registration call, structuring them as unique RPC calls.
-   Automatically looks up every RPC call in the Webinos Context Vocabulary, finds the corresponding match based on the API making the call, the name of the method called and in some cases the parameters used to match the call to a Context Object. The call’s input and output data are structured based on the Webinos Context Vocabulary’s rules, disallowing data like passwords and other sensitive information that are excluded from any contextual query and are not to be passed to the Policy Manager.
-   Context Objects created from RPC calls are stored in a buffer file if a PZH is not connected.
-   Context Objects created from RPC calls and those included in the context object buffer are sent to the PZH to be stored in the SQLite3 Context DB.
-   Allows the definition of custom Context Objects in a separate Webinos Application Context Vocabulary directly from the WRT.
-   Applications can request their own uniquely defined Context Objects to be stored in the PZH Context DB using the same structure as all other context data.
-   The data in the Context DB can be queried from the WRT using a custom Context Querying structure that allows the description of simple or complex queries containing sub-queries as related to Context Objects, treating the database as descriptive of Object Models. The results are returned as Context Objects.
-   Integration with the Policy Manager gives permissions to APIs and applications to store Context Objects in the PZH Context DB.
-   Integration with the Policy Manager gives permissions to applications to run context queries to the PZH Context DB.

Differences between 3.1, 4.1
----------------------------

In the 3.1 deliverable for context the focus was on the integration of the Context API with the rest of the proposed (then) webinos architecture, together with a set of specifications revolving around the potential usage of the API by webinos applications, while providing a few points on the actual implementation architecture. It was soon discovered during 4.1 that there was an important strategic decision to be taken. The Context API had to leave part of the data handling of the contextual information to the application developers by providing a number of tools to create, store, extract and analyse contextual information, while at the same time provide automatic mechanisms that store contextual information already transferred throughout the platform. The result was the introduction of the term and structure of "Context Object". A Context Object refers to a notion similar to a meme. It’s the minimum of data that are required to define any single personal contextual piece of information (e.g. MyLocation, MyHouse, MyFriend, MyFavoriteTVChannel etc).

The definitions of what pieces of data form a complete Context Object, where, when and how to find them are included in Context Vocabularies. These are text files in json structure. There are two forms of Context Vocabularies that were created in 4.1. The first one is the API Context Vocabulary, which is read-only to the application developer and contains definitions of Context Objects that utilise the RPC API calls that are made by applications to automatically store Context Objects. The second one is the Application Context Vocabulary, which contains the definitions of Context Objects created by applications. Application Context Objects are not stored automatically, but rather are requested to be stored by the application that defined each.

The Context Objects are flattened and stored on an SQLite3 database located on the PZH. If a connection to the PZH is not available (Virgin Mode), the data are stored in a temporary file as a buffer, until a connection to the PZH is available. The extraction of the Context Objects is performed via a custom SQL query builder created for the Context API. All the events relating to Context pass through the Policy Manager.

Main points to be added in the new specifications.
--------------------------------------------------

The proposed architecture can be summed up to the following schema:

The new requirements to be added include the registration of context objects to be extracted and stored locally per device, either based on simple extraction rules or more complex rules that describe Context Objects as results of more complex queries, without the requirement of a connection with the PZH. For example, a statistical rule applied on the MyLocations Context Objects can generate a more permanent Context Object called MyHome or MyWorkPlace.

Another requirement is the addition of a background service that will store API Context Objects while the PZP is running and without an application making specific API calls. The registration of such listeners should be implemented in the same way that Application Context Objects are defined through the Policy Manager.

Additionally, with the advancement of the Policy Manager and the ability to create more complex policy rules, each Context API call will have a number of policy events relating to it in the following axes:

-   Context API Method
-   Read/Write
-   Application making the request
-   Data Object (Context Object, rule to be added/updated etc)
