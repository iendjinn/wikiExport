Generic Sensor API
------------------

### Overview of API

Link to API - http://dev.webinos.org/specifications/new/sensors.html

The Webinos Generic Sensor API provides web applications with an API to access data from sensors in the device, connected to the device or in another device.

The API consists of two interfaces:
# A sensor interface that provides attributes for the sensors and a method to configure a selected sensor.
# A DOM level 3 event that provides sensor data.

### Threats

#### API-Specific threats and misuse cases

1.  Sensors may be receiving data from a wide range of sources or inputs. These might potentially be privacy-invasive, e.g.,
    1.  A power-usage sensor might indicate the user’s current activity
    2.  A sleep monitor (motion sensor) has some obvious privacy issues
    3.  Sensors might provide clues to the location of the end user - e.g. a temperature sensor at a known location during winter would expect to be warm when people are nearby and cold otherwise. This might be used by thieves to determine whether a house is occupied before a burglary.
    4.  Sound sensors might be able to overhear conversations

2.  Sensors might produce a large amount of data and therefore overuse the bandwidth or storage capacity of the device, resulting in slow network/device, high costs or denial of service altogether.
3.  Sensors may be more or less accurate than expected. If used for security-related tasks (such as where a door is open or closed, or in establishing user presence) this could cause security violations.

There are likely to be more threats for each type of sensor - this threat analysis is vague by definition.

#### Threats based on remote invocation of this API from another device

1.  Access to sensors on remote devices may be unexpected by the end user. They may not expect an application on a device in a different location to have access to this information
2.  Remote eavesdropping or spying on someone else may be enabled by this device, even accidentally. For example, in a shared house it might inform one occupant of the activities of the other by accident. This could cause embarrassment or expose sensitive information. The assumption that a sensor is only accessible for the place where the sensor is has been violated

#### Implementation threats and possible attacks

This API has not been implemented.

Suspected implementation issues:

-   The underlying sensor is going to be controlled by a device driver. This driver may be running in kernel mode. It may have implementation flaws which are exploitable from API invocation, such as buffer overruns or double free vulnerabilities. This could cause remote code execution from webinos APIs.

#### Threats to apps and developers using this API (E.g. Jimmy and Jessica)

1.  No assurance is provided to developers of the trustworthiness of the sensor. This should not be relied upon by developers.
2.  Apps could be fed a large stream of fake or unhelpful data by this API.

#### Threats to device manufacturers, operators, other stakeholders

1.  Cross-zone API use could result in high network traffic, particularly if combined with the context API
2.  If the sensor relates to the device itself - e.g. a sensor recording engine temperature - it could cause end users to believe their devices are faulty when they are not, or vice versa. This would be a problem for a manufacturer.

### Mitigations

1.  When adding a sensor to webinos, make it clear that this sensor is accessible from any device in the personal zone and provide users with the opportunity to disable this feature.
2.  If the sensor relates to part of a product and is known to be unreliable, the manufacturer may want to allow access to it only from applications with the manufacturer’s signature.
3.  When roaming or using a mobile network, the amount of data being sent by this API might be limited
4.  By default, user consent should be required when accessing this API both locally and remotely.
5.  Use of this API by an application should be logged
6.  Recommend to implementers of sensors that any free-form untyped text input ( sensorType and sensorId in the initSensorEvent method ) should be validated properly.
7.  Recommend to implementers that rate limits are set where appropriate on sensors.
8.  Display visual warnings on the device with the sensor when the sensor is in use, to avoid eavesdropping / privacy invasion by a remote or local app.

### Recommended default policy rules for applications

  ------------- --------------------------------------------------- -- ----- ------------------------------------------------------
  _.Code   _.Type
  B-A           Browser-based, authenticated via TLS certificates
  W-U           Widget, unrecognised
  ------------- --------------------------------------------------- -- ----- ------------------------------------------------------

For each application type, select one of these as the default policy for this API. This applies to an application which explicitly requests access to this API.
