Web application packaging handling and Web Runtime specification
================================================================

Application handling and packaging covers the description, packaging and handling of webinos applications as well as the handling and presentation (start, stop, install, remove, and update) of webinos applications on the device itself, i.e., how webinos web runtime environments have to deal with webinos applications.

**Up to now specification work in this theme is divided in three sub-tasks: Webinos Application Specification, Webinos Web Runtime Environment Specification and Distributed Application Specification**
* Webinos Application Specification is about how webinos applications are technically looking (web site vs. widgets)
* Webinos Web Runtimie Environment Specification is about requirements of the web runtime (supported standards, look and feel / UI, life cycle, mandatory runtime features)
* Distributed Application Specification is about how applications can be executed in a distributed manner (some code is running on device A and some other code is running on device B etc.)

Dedicated Topic Sub-pages
-------------------------

-   [[Webinos Core]]
-   [[Webinos Application Specification Open Questions]]

Webinos Application Specification
---------------------------------

-   Common web site
     - Give normal web sites access to webinos JS APIs and how would the security/policy integration be realized (e.g.a definition of â€œsome kind of config.xml for web sites to express their dependencies on features). Should we take care on this in the first phase?

-   Downloadable, exchangeable, installable application
     - E.g., packaged as W3C Widget http://www.w3.org/2008/webapps/wiki/WidgetSpecs
     `Widget: interactive single purpose application for displaying and/or updating local data or data on the Web, packaged in a way to allow a single download and installation on a user's machine or mobile device`
     - According to webinos requirements some more meta data tags must be introduced. For example, information about the distributor, potential destination for analytic data,human readable as well as machine processable version name, identification of personal and widget related data.
     - Less effort: use and extend (mostly related to meta data definitions) w3c widget
     - Medium effort: accessing applications using common web page approaches and make them offline available via app cache (define a manifest that contains more than just needed files for offline mode, equal to content of the w3c widget config.xml, how to exchange "app chached" applications between devices => define exchange format, e.g., app cache to widget)
     - Large effort: investigate new application model that takes care on the distributed fashion of webinos applications where different parts of applications may run on different devices (how to sign applications across devices, how to access and create policy statements without the need of a packaged application, distributed meta data access…)

Webinos Web Runtime Environment Specification
---------------------------------------------

-   What have Webinos runtimes at least to provide in order to be webinos compliant (from users point of view as well as architectural needs)
     - webinos application Life-cycle definition (install, use, update, delete)
     - allow user to install/delete applications using various mechanisms (e.g., via app store/client, via web site, via another webinos device, via file system)
     - UI: e.g., accessing webinos applications must follow the native OS approach of accessing applications
     - multitasking
     - trigger application execution based on user request or internal/external events (e.g., on boot completed, incoming external event, requested by another application)
     - Show user information about applications (icon, author,â€¦)
     - Secure storage of applications but also transportable by user?
     - Application Advertisment: discover and present applications available to the user which can be installed/used later on (not only locally installed applications but also apps provided by other devices (e.g. TV remote control or electronic program guide (EPG) applications which are provided by the TV set))
     - How to setup applications which should be available using advertisement methods. For example, providing an API which allows applications to be discoverable by others (or via native runtime functions, or via config.xml/manifest?)
     - how to handle webinos applications running in background (webinos services / no UI applications)
     - Policy Runtime Environment integration. For example, mandatory needs to the runtime like policy editor, remote policy exchange, transportable policies (depends on policy management working group).
     - Do we have "No UI" / "No Display" runtimes and if so how will they be managed
     - In addition to application advertisement, should applications be able to expose certain functionalities as services?
     - Possible Reference Specification WAC Waikiki http://www.wacapps.net/web/portal/wac-2.0-spec

-   Application code compliance definition (high level: applications will be based on web technology programming paradigms)
     - Which standards have webinos web runtimes to support (HTML x.y, CSS x.y, ECMAScript/JavaScript x.y, …)
     - For WRTs with user interface WAC 2.0 sufficient for now?
     - Subset for runtimes with no UI / do we have some?
     - Possible Reference Specification WAC Waikiki http://www.wacapps.net/web/portal/wac-2.0-spec

Distributed Application Specification
-------------------------------------

-   Provide possibilities to application developer to â€œoutsourceâ€ code to other devices in order to be remotely executed. E.g, for performance, security, or application rendering reasons.
     - Transmit code to other device
     - Trigger execution of desired code fragments
     - Back channel to â€œoriginatingâ€ application to allow communication between originator and outsourced code
-   Potential outsourcing possibilities (each with pros and cons, which one to go for?). Strongly related to the webinos application format:
     - Webinos applications can act as web server by providing discoverable web sites
     - Webinos applications can initiate â€œcloningâ€ of itself to be installed on another device where a specific start-up parameter could be provided to go on at a certain code fragment
     - Webinos application could explicitly transmit only a piece of code to other devices. Could be pre-defined code (the developer defines which code fragments might be used for code outsourcing, "widgets within a widget") or could be dynamic code (e.g., dynamically created by the application or requested from code repositories). How to sign dynamic code based on the "parent" application signature?

Related Specification Topics
============================

-   Event handling: some predefined events must be defined (e.g., to execute applications based on events)
-   (Application) Discovery: Runtime Environment must be able to detect available applications in order to advertise them to the user (e.g., based on ownership or physical distance)
-   Policy Management: WRE must be compliant to policy management specification. The user may have the option to import/export/edit policies what can be done using the WRE.
