Mozilla Security Policy Examples
================================

#### Example 1

A web site administrator wants all content to come from the site’s own domain, excluding even subdomains.
**`X-Content-Security-Policy: allow 'self'`**

h4. Example 2

A web site administrator wants to allow content from a trusted domain and all its subdomains.
**`X-Content-Security-Policy: allow 'self' *.mydomain.com`**

#### Example 3

A web site administrator wants to allow users of a web application to include images from any domain in their custom content, but to restrict audio or video media to come only from trusted providers, and all scripts only to a specific server that hosts trusted code.

**`X-Content-Security-Policy: allow 'self'; img-src *; media-src media1.com media2.com; script-src userscripts.example.com`**

Here, by default, content is only permitted from the document’s original host, with the following exceptions:
 * Images may loaded from anywhere (note the "*" wildcard).
 * Media is only allowed from media1.com and media2.com (and not from subdomains of those sites).
 * Executable script is only allowed from userscripts.example.com.

#### Example 4

An administrator for an online banking site wants to ensure that all its content is loaded using SSL, in order to prevent attackers from eavesdropping on requests.

**`X-Content-Security-Policy: allow https://onlinebanking.jumbobank.com`**

The server only permits access to documents being loaded specifically over HTTPS through the single domain onlinebanking.jumbobank.com.

#### Example 5

An administrator of a web mail site wants to allow HTML in email, as well as images loaded from anywhere, but not JavaScript or other potentially dangerous content.

**`X-Content-Security-Policy: allow 'self' *.mailsite.com; img-src *`**

Note that this example doesn’t specify a script-src; with the example CSP, this site uses the setting specified by the allow directive, which means that scripts can be loaded only from the originating server.
