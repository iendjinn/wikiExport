Web Intents introduction
------------------------

Basic introduction to Web Intents is here:
* Task 8.1 wiki page "Web Intents":http://dev.webinos.org/redmine/projects/wp8-1/wiki/Web_Intents
* Web Intents presentation "Webinos-_Introduction_to_Web_Intents.pdf":http://dev.webinos.org/redmine/attachments/2118/Webinos-_Introduction_to_Web_Intents.pdf

Why take Web Intents into Webinos?
----------------------------------

-   Web Intents has strong momentum in W3C and the web community and is driven by Google.
-   Adapt to a standardized service discovery/application launcher mechanism for the web.
-   Will help Webinos to get more attention.
-   Will help Webinos to integrate with web applications run in the browser context (Web Intents may not be suited for installed web applications/widgets)

>> All, please review and provide more input and corrections

Why not take Web Intents into Webinos?
--------------------------------------

-   Current browser centric model does not fit Webinos
-   Web Intents based APIs not yet available
-   Web Intents too much under Google control
-   Too much effort to switch to a Web Intents model

>> All, please review and provide more input and corrections

Options
-------

-   Don’t care about Web Intents.
-   Keep the current Webinos service discovery API for installed Webinos applications but base Webinos in browser context on Web Intents.
-   Switch to a Web Intents model both for Webinos installed applications and for Webinos browser based aplications

### Web Intents versus Webinos Security model

See wiki by John Lyle: "Web Intents Security Points":http://dev.webinos.org/redmine/projects/t3-4/wiki/WebIntentsSecurityPoints

### De-coupling Service registration from the browser - Service registration in PZP/PZH

Jean-Claude has started a thread at the W3C Web Intents mailing list on separating a Web Intents Agent (WIA) from the User Agent. This is important for webinos use of Web Intents. The thread starts here: http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-web-intents/2012Jun/0024.html.

The problem with the currently specified model is that it centered around the browser that the user currently is using. Please see the e-mail thread for more details.

If Webinos project decides to use Web Intents we can address this issue in two steps:

1.  De-couple Service registration from the specific user agent, i.e. provide a repository of registered Web Intents Services that can be shared among the different devices in a user’s personal zone. This repository could for example be located in the PZH.
2.  Full replacement of "Web Intents enabled User Agent" with "Web Intents Agent de-coupled from the User Agent".

### Web Intents based APIs

Some Web Intents use cases are ‘fire and forget’ and some use cases require a longer lasting relation between the Client application and the Service application.

-   "Fire ad Forget": Client sends payload data to the Service with intents attributes and Service returns data with the intents invocation method callback function.

-   "Message channel": Web Intents allows a longer lasting relation between the Client and the Service by an HTML message channel. On top of this message channel a high level protocols can run.

Both the ‘fire and forget’ and the "Message channel" cases requires standardized APIs.

One advantage with the Webinos Service Discovery API is that standard or Webinos APIs are used to interact with the discovered and selected Service.

For Web Intents there is much to be done in defining the interaction patterns/APIs/protocols to use between Clients and Services. So far we have (to a great extend inconsistent with each other) descriptions at:

-   "webintents.org":http://webintents.org/ Contains a list of intents that Google believes the majority of applications and services will use and data formats for interaction between Clients and Services. However, the level of detail is not enough for providing full interoperability between Clients and Services.

-   "Web Intents payload data format for MIME types":http://www.w3.org/wiki/WebIntents/MIME_Types: Proposes payload data format clients must use, and services can expect, when using MIME type specifiers.

-   "Web Intents payload data format for schema.org types":http://www.w3.org/wiki/WebIntents/schema.org_Types: Proposes payload data format clients must use, and services can expect, when using schema.org types are used.

-   "Pick Media Intent(Web Intents based Gallery API)":http://w3c-test.org/dap/gallery/

-   "Pick Contacts Intent(Web Intents based Contacts API)":http://w3c-test.org/dap/contacts/

For an example of the case when a message channel between the Client and Service pages is used to run a high level protocol see slide 18 in the presentation "W3C Web Intents - Local Network Service Discovery":http://www.w3.org/wiki/images/2/2e/V4_W3C_Web_Intents_-_Local_UPnP_Service_Discovery.pdf. Here a high level "TV Control Protocol", independent of low level communication (for example UPnP) method and details, is used by the Client web application.

### Web Intents versus Webinos AppLauncher API

A question was raised whether Web Intents could be used as an application launcher mechanism.

The general answer is yes in the context of one web application launching another web application of a certain type. However, comparing with the "Webinos AppLauncher module":http://dev.webinos.org/specifications/draft/launcher.html there are signficant differences.

Webinos AppLauncher module:
* Provides two methods:
**** Launch a Webinos application that is installed on the same device. The application to launch can be either Webinos native or an installed Webinos application and is identified by a unique application identity.
**** Check if a Webinos application, identified by a unique application identity, is installed on the device.
* The operation of the API is guided by application execution policies, which can be modified by user.

Web Intents:
* Allows a web application to launch another "Service" web application identified by the action the Service performs and a type. For example pick an image (action="Pick", type="image/*") or view a video (action="View", type="video/*"). The User Agent allows the user to choose the Service application to use among a list of registered Services that are capable of handling this action and type. There is also a possibility for a Client application to point out a unique Service web application that should be launched, see "Explicit Intents":http://dvcs.w3.org/hg/web-intents/raw-file/tip/spec/Overview.html#explicit-intents.
* The Service executing the Intent does not have to be installed in the device, it can reside anywhere.
* The Client web application requesting the action to be performed and the executing Service web application are annonymous to each other if not an explicit Service is stated when the Client invokes the Intent.
* The security model is based on user consent when selecting a Service to use for the requested Action. Operation is not guided by any pre-configured application execution policies. However, a Web Intents enabled Service can of course implement any standard web security mechanisms as needed, e.g.login with user credentials or transport layer security.
* There is currently no explicit method to check the availability of a certain Service application and expose this information to the requesting Client web application (and I don’t think it should due to privacy/fingerprinting reasons). However, the specification opens up for applications to provide a user controlled check of registered Services. According to the Web Intents specification, section 4, 2nd paragrah:

> The User Agent must not allow web pages the ability to discover passively which services the user has configured to handle particular intents, or any intents, whether by enumeration or exact query. There may be mechanisms for the user to actively grant this information to web pages, but it must not be made available passively.

So, it should be possible to provide a method, that is governed by Webinos security policies, to check registered Web Intents Services.

The conclusion is that Web Intents is a more general concept than Webinos application launching but it should be possible to use Web Intents as an application launcher mechanism in the webinos context.
