Chrome Extensions
=================

"An extension is a zipped bundle of filesâ€”HTML, CSS, JavaScript, images, and anything else you needâ€”that adds functionality to the Google Chrome browser. Extensions are essentially web pages with access to all the APIs that the browser provides to web pages. (…) They can interact with web pages or servers using content scripts or cross-origin XMLHttpRequests. Addtionally extensions can also interact programmatically with browser features such as bookmarks and tabs." [1]

There are no direct mechanisms avaialble for extensions to call javascript functions of a web page or vice versa. JS functions can be invoked using DOM manipulation.[2]
Besides the regular APIs for webpages and APIs for handling bookmarks and tabs. No API is provided to interact with the underlying operating system. In order to access to the underlying operating systems an extension can embed a custom NPAPI plugin, which is part of zipped bundle.[3]

Pros
----

-   single instance of an "extensions" running on the device while beeing accessible by numerous applications (compared to embedding plugin directly into to web app)
-   mixture of native and javascript components for an extension possible

Cons
----

-   interaction between extensions and web application fairly complex and hard to use.
-   simple and easy API for interaction is missing and needs to be define

Lesson learned
--------------

For evaluation puproses the discorvery NPAPI plugin by Dave and Ziran [4] has been integrated into a chrome extensions [5]. It prooves that the interaction between a web application and the extesnion is not solved perfectly. An useable API for app developer could be defined, which hides the complexity of the interaction between app and extension.
